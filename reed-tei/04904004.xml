Philip S. Hench, M.D.<lb/>

Rochester, Minnesota<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You asked me to let you know what happened regarding Lambert's<lb/>
bill in congrass:</p>
<p>The House sub-committee, Armed Forces, voted affirmative on<lb/>
January 19th, and the full committee likewise on January24th.<lb/>
Was brought to the floor and passed House January 25th, and<lb/>
is now in Senate Committee. Chances of passing are good, for<lb/>
as I remember they seldom reverse such a non-political bill<lb/>
having House approval.</p>
<p>I hope it does, as it will just about kill Lambert if it<lb/>
fails again. He is in bad condition from having an eye en-<lb/>
eculated and then in hospital with lung trouble in addition<lb/>
to his other disabilities. He wrote me that he was going<lb/>
to Washington if called if he had to go on a stretcher!</p>
<p>But O'Hara, his Congressman presented all paper evidence<lb/>
personally, and that was sufficient to convince the committee.</p>
<p>Lambert is jubilant over the resul<del>y</del><add>t</add>t so far. Said scores of<lb/>
veterans had told him he could never win. But he naively<lb/>
believes that right will always win. I never believed that<lb/>
the Act of 1929 would be reopened and did not think it should,<lb/>
yet I helped him in all ways possible to me. Then as years<lb/>
passed conditions changed: There remained but one alive who<lb/>
could be legimimately recognized, and I felt that had Reed<lb/>
lived Lambert would have been on that Roll, so I worked with<lb/>
him with self-conviction.</p>
<p>His joy is marred greatly that Ames has not been honored<lb/>
posthumously for his work. He is sure, (as I, too,am) that<lb/>
without Ames the experiment would have failed, anyway until<lb/>
years later. By then the conditions could not have been du-<lb/>
plicated, nor any physician arose who could have cured Y.F.<lb/>
with the marvelous success of Doctor Ames. With all the<lb/>
famous &ldquo;experts&rdquo; there, who had lived with Y. F. and talked<lb/>
and wrote about it, none even approached Ames in <hi>curing</hi> it.</p>
<p>Under the House Bill he won't receive any accumulated back<lb/>
pay as they fear such a sum might deter the President from<lb/>
signing it.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Cordially &amp; Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>Paul L. Tate</signed>
Paul L. Tate<lb/>
<seg>Will be highly pleased to receive the material you wrote of<lb/>
and appreciate your thoughtfulness.<lb/>
Tate</seg>
