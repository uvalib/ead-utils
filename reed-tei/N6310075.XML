1901</p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>Yellow Fever Experiments.</p>
<p>According to the unanimous opinion of<lb/>
the Yellow Fever Board of Havana the ex-<lb/>
periments of Drs. Caldas and Bellinzaghi<lb/>
with their new vaccine and curative serum<lb/>
have resulted in complete failure.</p>
<p>The trial was a fair one, and the result<lb/>
was what might have been expected. The<lb/>
HERALD several days ago ventured the opin-<lb/>
ion that it was difficult to understand upon<lb/>
what scientific basis the claims of these<lb/>
gentlemen could rest, as no specific germ of<lb/>
the fever had yet been satisfactorily demon-<lb/>
strated. It now appears that the experi-<lb/>
menters declined to exhibit their particular<lb/>
microbe to the board. Certainly this seri-<lb/>
ously prejudiced the case from an impartial<lb/>
scientific standpoint, as did also the refusal<lb/>
on the part of the inventors to divulge the<lb/>
composition of their products. The army<lb/>
board, however, very generously overlooked<lb/>
such shortcomings and did its full duty as<lb/>
an expert jury.</p>
<p>The experimenters in self-defence now<lb/>
say that the case was not one of yellow<lb/>
fever, and that the deductions of the board<lb/>
are consequently unwarranted.</p>
<p>However this may be, it is high time to<lb/>
call a halt in all such experiments. The<lb/>
board has acted wisely in setting its face<lb/>
against them in future. There are other<lb/>
means of discovering curative measures<lb/>
without ruthlessly risking human life.</p>
<p>It must by no means be inferred in spite<lb/>
of occasional failures that careful investi-<lb/>
gations on legitimate lines need to be discon-<lb/>
tinued. Already very substantial progress<lb/>
has been made in very promising directions.<lb/>
The mosquito has within the last year<lb/>
loomed up as a most important causative<lb/>
factor in the problem. In fact, it would al-<lb/>
most seem in the light of the recent obser-<lb/>
vations that this insect is the main propa-<lb/>
gating element of the disease. If this can<lb/>
be proved beyond doubt by more extended<lb/>
experience the matter of prevention can be<lb/>
narrowed to very limited issues.</p>
<p>How to render persons immune to the dis-<lb/>
ease is as yet far from being definitely set-<lb/>
tled. Apparently the only hope of doing so<lb/>
rests with the discovery of a protecting and<lb/>
curative serum. The latter can be possible<lb/>
only after the specific germ of the disease<lb/>
is isolated and subjected to &ldquo;control&rdquo; ex-<lb/>
periments. The model of such a find is the<lb/>
antitoxin of diphtheria. Strange to say,<lb/>
however, that agent is the only one of all<lb/>
the alleged curative serums that has held<lb/>
its own. Its discovery, however, proves an<lb/>
important scientific principle, and similar<lb/>
ones must necessarily follow in its wake.</p>
<p>The pity is at this juncture that Dr.<lb/>
Caldas did not make good his claims and<lb/>
give to the world the long wished for<lb/>
remedy. But it must come ere long.</p>
<p>The earnest and bright workers in the<lb/>
army laboratories are looking in right direc-<lb/>
tions. When they succeed there will be<lb/>
nothing hidden as to their methods of work-<lb/>
ing, as to the composition of their mixtures<lb/>
or their modes of manufacture. Thus, too,<lb/>
will science have no secrets from humanity<lb/>
and no pecuniary gains from human suffer-<lb/>
ing.</p>
<p>Fortunately we can at this writing the<lb/>
more patiently await developments in view<lb/>
of the fact that fewer cases of the fever<lb/>
exist than ever before, and that no time is<lb/>
being lost in applying all those improved<lb/>
methods of sanitation which, above all<lb/>
theories, prove the safest of all methods of<lb/>
public reform and the surest of all means of<lb/>
future safety.</p>
