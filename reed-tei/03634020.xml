<salute>Dear Phil,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Some weeks ago I had a notion that maybe I<lb/>
could get to W &amp; J., especially when Uncle Sam suggested that<lb/>
we drive up together late Friday so that we could be there for the<lb/>
Saturday exercises. But about a week ago I could see<lb/>
that I couldn't go. I have, for one thing, a formal lecture<lb/>
that I am giving on Monday afternoon, probably the most<lb/>
dignified and serious speech Ive made, and it's still in<lb/>
the formative stage. And there are many other things. Recently<lb/>
I was made chairman of the Public Occasions Committee (speeches,<lb/>
foundation <unclear>lectureships</unclear>, etc.) and that is a time- consuming<lb/>
job too. So I shall have to <unclear>miss</unclear> the trip. I'm sorry: Id<lb/>
like to listen in on it all, but I cannot.</p>
<p>I didn't <del>say</del><add>write</add> anything about Mr. Moran for there was<lb/>
nothing I could learn to say. Within the last 10 days. When I 
saw,<lb/>
Jordan, he said they still were waiting for news. Nor till<lb/>
four days ago did I hear anything and that was the<lb/>
medical school's invitation to the banquet for Moran up<lb/>
at Mr. <unclear>Beauchamps</unclear> new mountain top dining room,<lb/>
banquet hall, I should say. It's to be held tomorrow,<lb/>
Tuesday night. So he can easily make the jump<lb/>
to Washington and be on hand for everything there.</p>
<p>I'll ask Dr. Jordan about Dr. Cooke and see if<lb/>
some one who understands medicine will <del>take</del> make some<lb/>
memorandum of what Cooke says, <hi>if</hi>, <hi>and</hi>, and <hi>when</hi><lb/>
he <hi>says what.</hi></p>
<p>It's nearly time for the last mail out. But I'll<lb/>
tell you a joke I heard the other day. A man had been away<lb/>
from city life for a long time, and when he returned he was<lb/>
asked to a rather swell dinner. He was fearful less<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03634021"/>
his manners might <del>have</del> be not all they are supposed<lb/>
to be. Still, he went. Later a friend asked him how<lb/>
he got along. &ldquo;All right, for a good deal of the meal,&rdquo;<lb/>
he answered, &ldquo;except for one thing. When they asked me if<lb/>
I wanted some corn, I passed my glass instead<lb/>
of my plate.&rdquo;</p>
