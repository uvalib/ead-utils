<salute>Dear Mr. Weckerly:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your unsigned letter of March 14th. has just reached me and I<lb/>
am, by this mail, sending a check for ten dollars ($10.00) to Mr.<lb/>
N. B. Johnson for the preliminary work he executed on the maps I<lb/>
ordered for the History of Yellow Fever. <add>(Mem. (Dec 16&sol;29 carbon<lb/>
of letter to Mr. Johnson enclosing<lb/>
check for 10.00 sent to Mr. Gillette<lb/>
Rockefeller<lb/>
foundation</add></p>
<p>I had hoped and expected that you would have heard from Dr.<lb/>
Morley long e'er this--indeed had hoped that he had had time to fill<lb/>
in (<del>of</del><add>and</add> have filled in) the three outline maps <add>for which</add> he agreed to be respon-<lb/>
sible <del>for</del>, and had returned the maps to you to be put in permanent<lb/>
shape, since the above-mentioned filling<add>-</add>in was simply to indicate<lb/>
what was desired--the finished work to be done yourself or someone<lb/>
chosen by you. I much regret this delay, but I suppose it is unavoid-<lb/>
able and although I shall write to Dr. Morley on the subject within<lb/>
the next few days, there is a chance, as you say, that &ldquo;we may receive<lb/>
little assistance from&rdquo; him &ldquo;before the fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have <add>been</add> equally unfortunate in not being able to consult with the<lb/>
only man I wish to see here in Baltimore about the 4th. map (Mercator's<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0319003"/>
Mercator's<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
projection of the West Coast of Africa and the East Coast of<lb/>
the Americas. This, on account of his having been so pressed and<lb/>
harassed with other work that it was impossible for him to take on<lb/>
anything else. I hope and trust, however, that we shall be able to<lb/>
get together in the not far distant future, and shall, of course, notify<lb/>
you as soon as this occurs.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let me assure you of my deep appreciation not<lb/>
only of your very material assistance in my work but of your understand-<lb/>
ing and kindness in these unavoidable delays.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>

P. S. As to my health, it has been bad all winter--indeed I can see<lb/>
no improvement in the last twelve months. However, as long as I am<lb/>
well enough to do <hi>good</hi> work on the book, its all right. The thing is<lb/>
worth a lot more than I am and if I can finish it with the help of your-<lb/>
self, Drs. Frost: Morley etc. I'll have justified my existence even if<lb/>
I'm too &ldquo;used up&rdquo; thereafter to ever do anything else. I hope I won't<lb/>
be, for I'm well trained along certain lines. However, this isn't the<lb/>
time for me to held back for a problematic future--its the present job<lb/>
that matters! Thank you<del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> for your kind inquiry, however. Good<lb/>
wishes do help--a lot!<lb/>
P. S. #2: If it is perfectly convenient for you to keep the<lb/>
outline maps, as heretofore, I should be grateful if you would con-<lb/>
tinue to do so for the present.<lb/>
