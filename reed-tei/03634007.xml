<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here I have these two good letters of yours. I want to try to answer<lb/>
them as fully and as plainly as I can.</p>
<p>First, there are a lot of things that are cockeyed about you, not the<lb/>
least among which is this humble modesty. I would never have had<lb/>
occasion to make the comment I made about Hutch's distribution of<lb/>
degrees if he had confined his approval to Phil Henches. Truly and<lb/>
sincerely, I know of no man on his way up that is more deserving of<lb/>
such an honor than you.</p>
<p>In a like manner, I don't believe degrees should be given except to<lb/>
people whose acceptance of the degree in turn honors the college award-<lb/>
ing it. The system at Washington and Jefferson is, in my opinion, all<lb/>
haywire. I have advocated for a long time that no degree be awarded<lb/>
until the name of the candidate proposed together with all qualifications<lb/>
be submitted to all the trustees and that a blackball would eliminate<lb/>
the awarding of a degree. That is not the system. There is a committee<lb/>
on degrees and the only time a trustee like myself gets a look in on<lb/>
them is when I happen to be at a meeting.</p>
<p>I happened to be at the meeting at which your name was brought up. I<lb/>
did not bring it up; but, as I have already inferred, there was no time<lb/>
that I voted on a degree with more enthusiasm than that of yours. But<lb/>
you see you are wrong again. I had nothing to do with the inspiring of<lb/>
this honor.</p>
<p>The thing that caused my comment was the degree that Washington and<lb/>
Jefferson awarded to that Donald Duck - Harold Ickes. I think politicians<lb/>
are just like Indians. The only good ones are the dead ones. In other<lb/>
words, all political degrees should be posthumous and personally I think<lb/>
we will never get rid of the stench that that Ickes degree leaves in its<lb/>
track.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03634008"/>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>I had wanted to be out at this Home-Coming Week and be present when you<lb/>
spoke and were awarded your degree but it is going to be impossible for<lb/>
me to be there. My distance from Washington and Jefferson makes it<lb/>
very difficult for me to get there even once a year, which I have prom-<lb/>
ised myself to do. But, unfortunately, due to a collection of appoint-<lb/>
ments, it would be utterly impossible to get out there this month. So<lb/>
consider me as present and approving in spirit although not in person.</p>
<p>If you, or you and Mary, come on to New York in connection with this<lb/>
trip to Washington and Jefferson, do let me know. Perhaps I can get<lb/>
the two of you up here for a weekend.</p>
<p>With best to both of you,</p>
