<p>The Republic's Forget-<lb/>
fulness</p>
<p>Republics have short memories. It is<lb/>
only a little over five years since Dr.<lb/>
Walter Reed reported to the Pan-Amer-<lb/>
ican Congress at Havana the results of<lb/>
his experiments, by which it had been<lb/>
demonstrated that yellow fever is not,<lb/>
properly speaking, contagious; that it is<lb/>
not carried by clothing; that it does not<lb/>
infect the house; that the common if<lb/>
not the sole method of transmission is the<lb/>
bite of an infected mosquito; and that<lb/>
the spread of the fever can be controlled<lb/>
and practically prevented by the destruc-<lb/>
tion of the mosquito or the protection of<lb/>
the sick against her bite, since if the mos-<lb/>
quito is not infected she cannot infect<lb/>
others. The effect of this demonstration,<lb/>
obtained at the hazard of life, has been to<lb/>
render America practically secure against<lb/>
further incursions of this terrible scourge.</p>
<p>And yet to the most of our readers the<lb/>
name of Walter Reed is unknown; to<lb/>
nearly all of them the names are wholly<lb/>
unknown of the private soldiers who<lb/>
voluntarily subjected themselves to yel-<lb/>
low fever for the purpose of furnishing<lb/>
this demonstration; and to many of them<lb/>
there is only a faint impression of the<lb/>
experiments themselves, as recorded<lb/>
at the time in fugitive articles in the<lb/>
newspapers and periodicals. We are<lb/>
therefore very glad that Professor How-<lb/>
<unclear>ard</unclear> A. Kelly has preserved in permanent<lb/>
form the record of this heroic adventure<lb/>
in a biography of Walter Reed. This<lb/>
biography is notably well written. Sym-<lb/>
pathetic without a hint of sentiment,<lb/>
appreciative without a hint of fulsome<lb/>
eulogy, romantic without heroic writing,<lb/>
sufficiently scientific without being need-<lb/>
lessly technical, the experiences it de-<lb/>
scribes are of such importance as to<lb/>
justify recalling them here to our readers.</p>
<p>Dr. Finlay, of Cuba, was the first to<lb/>
suggest that the mosquito might be an<lb/>
agent for the transmission of yellow<lb/>
fever. This remained, however, an un-<lb/>
proved suggestion until the year 1900,<lb/>
when the Medical Commission of which<lb/>
Dr. Reed was made chairman was ap-<lb/>
pointed to investigate the cause and<lb/>
endeavor to ascertain a cure, or, what is<lb/>
more important, a prevention, of yellow<lb/>
fever. To determine whether this disease<lb/>
was carried by contaminated clothing,<lb/>
or by the mosquito, or by both media,<lb/>
it was necessary to find men who would<lb/>
volunteer themselves for a process of terri-<lb/>
ble experimentation. Dr. Carroll, of the<lb/>
Commission, first offered himself for this<lb/>
purpose. He submitted to the bite of<lb/>
a mosquito which had previously been<lb/>
allowed to bite yellow fever patients, as a<lb/>
result was taken sick with the yellow fever,<lb/>
was carried to the yellow fever camp,<lb/>
and his life hung in the balance for three<lb/>
days, though he eventually recovered.<lb/>
A single experiment did not, however,<lb/>
suffice to furnish a scientific demon-<lb/>
stration. An experimental station was<lb/>
opened, volunteers were called for, a<lb/>
number offered themselves, and two were<lb/>
selected. &ldquo;Dr. Reed talked the matter<lb/>
over with them, explaining fully the dan-<lb/>
ger and suffering involved in the experi-<lb/>
ment should it be successful, and then,<lb/>
seeing they were determined, he stated<lb/>
that a definite money compensation<lb/>
would be made to them. Both young<lb/>
men declined to accept it, making it,<lb/>
indeed, their sole stipulation that they<lb/>
should receive no pecuniary reward;<lb/>
whereupon Major Reed touched his cap,<lb/>
saying respectfully, &lsquo;Gentlemen, I salute<lb/>
you.&rsquo; Reed's own words in his pub-<lb/>
lished account of the experiment on<lb/>
Kissinger are: &lsquo;In my opinion, this<lb/>
exhibition of moral courage has never<lb/>
been surpassed in the annals of the<lb/>
Army of the United States.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this judgment our readers, we<lb/>
are sure, will agree; but this courage<lb/>
was quite equaled by that exhibited in a<lb/>
later experiment, when three non-im-<lb/>
munes slept from November 30 to De-<lb/>
cember 19, a period of twenty days, in<lb/>
bedding taken from the beds of patients<lb/>
sick with yellow fever, and especially<lb/>
soiled with the results of the yellow fever<lb/>
disease, in a room furnished with the<lb/>
least possible ventilation, in an air ex-<lb/>
cessively malodorous, and in a temper-<lb/>
ature both hot and humid. Their cour-<lb/>
age in submitting to such a test is not<lb/>
lessened by the fact that all &ldquo;remained<lb/>
in perfect health notwithstanding their<lb/>
stay of twenty nights amid such unwhole-<lb/>
some surroundings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These experiments were preceded and<lb/>
accompanied by scientific processes<lb/>
which fill our lay mind with amazement.<lb/>
We read that the scientists dissected the<lb/>
diseased mosquito after feeding, and<lb/>
found comparatively few yellow fever<lb/>
germs in the stomach of the insect, but<lb/>
discovered them moving languidly in its<lb/>
<unclear>horacic</unclear> muscles. Nor is this all. The<lb/>
metamorphosis of this germ, traced from<lb/>
the stomach to the thorax of the mos-<lb/>
quito, was further examined and re-<lb/>
corded--a metamorphosis which takes<lb/>
from six to seven days to complete,<lb/>
and is accompanied by an enormous in-<lb/>
crease in size and activity. This exam-<lb/>
ination of the growth processes of an<lb/>
organism dwelling in the muscles of so<lb/>
small an insect as the mosquito furnishes<lb/>
a striking illustration of the perfection to<lb/>
which microscopy has been carried.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for us to trace here<lb/>
in any detail the effect of these discov-<lb/>
eries on health conditions. That effect<lb/>
is illustrated by the facts that while in<lb/>
October, 1900, there were over three<lb/>
hundred deaths from yellow fever in<lb/>
Havana, in October, 1901, there were<lb/>
but three deaths. Dr. Reed and his<lb/>
associates have conquered the yellow<lb/>
fever. We believe that the words of<lb/>
General Leonard Wood, spoken at the<lb/>
memorial service in honor of Dr. Reed,<lb/>
are entirely justified: &ldquo;His discovery<lb/>
results in the saving of more lives an-<lb/>
nually than were lost in the Cuban war,<lb/>
and saves the commercial interests of<lb/>
the world a greater financial loss in each<lb/>
year than the cost of the entire Cuban<lb/>
war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What has the country done for the<lb/>
men who, at the hazard of their lives,<lb/>
have done so much for the country?<lb/>
Nothing. The volunteers who offered<lb/>
to sacrifice their lives for future genera-<lb/>
tions have had no recognition. If Dr.<lb/>
Reed had devoted to private practice the<lb/>
signal abilities which he gave to the<lb/>
public, he would have left a comfortable<lb/>
competence and perhaps a large fortune<lb/>
to his wife. As it was, he left her com-<lb/>
paratively unprovided for. A volunteer<lb/>
subscription for a fund of twenty-five<lb/>
thousand dollars, the income of which<lb/>
should be devoted to Dr. Reed's widow<lb/>
and daughter during their lives, and the<lb/>
principal after their death to a monu-<lb/>
ment to his memory or to the promo-<lb/>
tion of results in his special field of<lb/>
work, has halted at seventeen thousand.<lb/>
There ought to be plenty of private con-<lb/>
tributors to complete this subscription.<lb/>
And Congress, which passes innumer-<lb/>
able pension bills with but scant con-<lb/>
sideration, would do well to make a<lb/>
generous appropriation to this fund, and<lb/>
provide at least medals to be presented<lb/>
<unclear>to</unclear> the nameless heroes who happily sur-<lb/>
vived these terrible experiments.</p>
