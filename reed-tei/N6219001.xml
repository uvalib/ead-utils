RID CUBA (SLAP) OF MOSQUITOES (SLAP)</p>

<p>[SPECIAL CABLE TO THE HERALD.]</p>
<p>HAVANA, Cuba. Saturday.--Major Kean,<lb/>
who came here to fight the pestiferous <unclear>Cu-<lb/>
ban</unclear> mosquito, has met a foe worthy of his<lb/>
deadliest oil. A swarm of them watching<lb/>
their chance made a pointed protest<lb/>
against his operations by attacking him<lb/>
personally the other day in his office. They<lb/>
were of the worst breed, too, the yellow<lb/>
fever kind. but fortunately were not<lb/>
able to fill him full of anything but bites<lb/>
and respect. To this fact both the Major<lb/>
and Captain Thomas, his assistant, who<lb/>
took part in the battle, owe their exemp-<lb/>
tion from the list of new cases reported.</p>
<p>It was at the breakfast hour, when all<lb/>
native assistants had gone out. The head-<lb/>
quarters of the bug brigade, thus de-<lb/>
serted, was practically defenceless. No<lb/>
danger from the enemy entered the<lb/>
Major's head until he felt it in his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These fellows are doing splendidly.<lb/>
After another month you won't be able to<lb/>
find a--- By George, there is one in<lb/>
here.&rdquo; and, rolling up his trousers, he got<lb/>
down to business on his left ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One?&rdquo; yelled Thomas, waving his hands<lb/>
and slapping his brow. &ldquo;There are a dozen<lb/>
around me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Getting a microscope when the attack<lb/>
was <unclear>fiercest</unclear> the Major, true to science,<lb/>
<unclear>calmly</unclear> viewed a live bloodthirsty foe.<lb/>
Then the glass fell to the floor, as he<lb/>
cried:--&ldquo;This is a stegomyia. Where do<lb/>
they come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A brief examination showed how the<lb/>
fortress of the Board of Health had been<lb/>
nearly carried. Around on tables were<lb/>
jars full of wrigglers from all parts of<lb/>
Havana, that the doctors might, after<lb/>
their development, learn the location pre-<lb/>
ferred as a place of residence by the dif-<lb/>
ferent breeds of parents. The pests, it<lb/>
was found, had eaten the gauze top out<lb/>
of the stegomyia jar, and, <unclear>while</unclear> they <unclear>pre-<lb/>
fer</unclear> a yellow fever stimulant, they, for-<lb/>
tunately for the Major and Captain, be-<lb/>
gan life on plain, simple diet. There is a<lb/>
lead weight on that jar now and a strong<lb/>
smell of sulphur in the room.</p>
