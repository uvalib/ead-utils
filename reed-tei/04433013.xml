Dr. Vernon W. Lippard, Dean<lb/>
Medical School<lb/>
University of Virginia<lb/>
Charlottesville, Virginia<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Lippard:</salute>
</opener>
<p>On December 3, the anniversary of the birthday of Carlos Finlay, which is<lb/>
&ldquo;Physicians' Day in Cuba,&rdquo; the Cuban Government is memorializing the remains<lb/>
of Walter Reed's Camp Lazear in Quemados de Marianao. The remains of<lb/>
Building No. 1 have been repaired, a little park has been made and on a<lb/>
stone wall will be unveiled several individual bronze medallions, profiles<lb/>
of Finlay, Delgado, Reed, Carroll, Lazear, Agramonte and Wood. On each<lb/>
side will be a bronze tablet with the names of the volunteers who served<lb/>
as guinea pigs.</p>
<p>This will be, I believe, a significant occasion because heretofore there<lb/>
has been, unfortunately, a considerable feeling of animosity in certain<lb/>
Cuban circles against those who have honored Reed and his colleagues, the<lb/>
Cuban viewpoint being that American medicine has ignored the great contribu-<lb/>
tion of Finlay. Now for the first time the Cuban Government is honoring the<lb/>
contribution of the Americans by memorializing Camp Lazear in this way. Al-<lb/>
though I am not certain, it is possible that they may not retain the name<lb/>
Camp Lazear but may rename the place Parque Finlay. Nevertheless, the<lb/>
bronze tablets, the dedicatory speeches and so on, will make clear the sig-<lb/>
nificance of this spot and they are making a small but nevertheless fine<lb/>
beginning towards a better Cuban-American relationship.</p>
<p>I believe the Cuban Government is planning to send invitations to a number<lb/>
of Americans and American medical institutions. They have been delayed in<lb/>
doing this because of some uncertainty as to the final date for the dedica-<lb/>
tion; but the date has now been set for December 3. I know that General<lb/>
Streit, Commanding General of Walter Reed Hospital, will be there representing<lb/>
the Surgeon General and a few others are planning to go. The U. S. Embassy<lb/>
will participate in the ceremonies.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the Americans who attend this ceremony should not go<lb/>
empty-handed but should respond in a generous way to the gracious intent<lb/>
of the Cuban Government and medical profession and thus strengthen the<lb/>
friendship between the Cuban and American medical professions. It occurred<lb/>
to me that since Major Reed was a graduate of the University of Virginia<lb/>
Medical School (1869), the Medical School or the Medical Alumni Association<lb/>
might wish to have a representative of their institution place a wreath or<lb/>
floral decoration under the medallion of Major Reed on this occasion.<lb/>
Therefore I am writing you asking whether you would think that would be ap-<lb/>
propriate. I am writing similar letters to the other half dozen institu-<lb/>
tions from which those who are mainly to be honored obtained their medical<lb/>
degrees.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f04433014"/>
<p>Dr. Vernon W. Lippard,</p>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>November 19, 1952</p>
<p>Actually, two additional University of Virginia alumni are being honored; on<lb/>
one of the tablets will appear the name of General Jefferson Randolph Kean<lb/>
and that of John J. Moran. Would you care to provide two wreaths, one for<lb/>
the medallion of Reed and one to be placed under the bronze tablet honoring,<lb/>
among others, General Kean and Mr. Moran? If you should only wish to pro-<lb/>
vide one I shall abide by your choice. Incidentally, as you know, Walter<lb/>
Reed received a second medical degree from the Bellevue Medical College.<lb/>
They might be willing to provide one wreath and the University of Virginia<lb/>
could provide the other.</p>
<p>This merely is a request for information as to whether you would think this<lb/>
gesture appropriate. If so, I shall communicate by cable with the Cuban<lb/>
authorities and ask them if they will make a place during the ceremony for<lb/>
the placing of these wreaths.</p>
<p>If you have an alumnus that lives in Havana (and it need not necessarily be<lb/>
a physician) it would be most appropriate for him to place the wreath at<lb/>
the proper time; or better yet, if one of your faculty could go (and I fear<lb/>
that the Cuban Government has no monetary subsidy), that would be excellent<lb/>
and I will request that a personal invitation be sent for them. If neither<lb/>
of these are possible, I would myself see to it that the wreath was placed<lb/>
at the proper time, either by the American Ambassador, by General Streit,<lb/>
or by myself. However it would be much more effective if a representative<lb/>
of your institution could do that, providing this suggestion is approved<lb/>
first by you and then by our Cuban hosts.</p>
<p>Our local florist has told me that he thought a circular wreath of laurel<lb/>
leaves, perhaps 30 inches in diameter, would be appropriate, perhaps with<lb/>
a silk ribbon either with the colors of the college or red, white and blue<lb/>
for the United States, at a cost of perhaps $15 or so. Should you approve<lb/>
of the general idea, would you care to have your own representative arrange<lb/>
for the preparation of the wreath in Havana? If not, I should be glad to<lb/>
help in any way and could either have the half dozen or so wreaths made up<lb/>
in Havana a day or two ahead, or according to our local florist, they can<lb/>
be made up in Miami and flown to Havana and delivered to the appropriate<lb/>
person for placement.</p>
<p>I would appreciate greatly hearing from you at your earliest convenience.<lb/>
Enclosed please find a photograph of the blue print and a reprint which<lb/>
will refresh your mind on the significance of Camp Lazear.</p>

P.S.: If it seems more appropriate, you might prefer to send a telegraphic<lb/>
message. The wire could be sent either to His Excellency Dr. Jose Andreu,<lb/>
El Ministro de Salubridad y Asistencia Social or to one of his agents in<lb/>
this matter, Dr. Pedro Nogueira, Marti 219, Marianao, Havana, or Dr. Cesar<lb/>
Rodriguez Exposito, Secretary, Marti 219, Marianao, Havana.<lb/>
