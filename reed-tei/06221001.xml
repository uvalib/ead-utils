Havana, Cuba, <date value="1907-10-31">October 31, 1907.</date>
</dateline>
To The Provisional Governor,<lb/>
The Palace.<lb/>
<salute>Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have the honor to forward herewith the report of the Chief Sanit-<lb/>
ary Officer of the Republic of Cuba, which gives a history of the work<lb/>
of the Department during the past year and, as an introduction thereto,<lb/>
a brief statement of its organization and operations antecedent to the<lb/>
date of Intervention. Attached to his report is that of the Executive<lb/>
Officer, showing the internal organization of the central Office and<lb/>
the despatch of business of its numerous divisions.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the delay in organizing the National<lb/>
Sanitary Service after the establishment of the Cuban Republic as well<lb/>
as the loss of the sanitary chiefs by the withdrawal on May 20, 1902,<lb/>
of the American officers who had been engaged in that work, made an<lb/>
unfortunate relapse in sanitary work throughout the Island, but less<lb/>
in Havana than elsewhere, and that the former standards were never<lb/>
entirely regained. This is well shown by the reports which were called<lb/>
for from all local health officers a year ago. All of them told the<lb/>
same story of inadequate appropriations and gross sanitary neglects.<lb/>
A considerable number contained the statement that all sanitary services<lb/>
in the municipality were at an end. But the essential defect of sanitary<lb/>
administration was more deeply fixed, and was a part of the failure of<lb/>
the scheme of autonomous municipal government which had been adopted<lb/>
for Cuba.</p>
<p>It is not proposed to discuss the reasons for this failure further<lb/>
than to say that it was to a considerable extent financial and due to a<lb/>
defective scheme of taxation. Thus the sanitary services of the smaller<lb/>
towns were both ill-supported and ill-administered. That of the City<lb/>
of Havana was supported from the National Treasury with lavish liberality<lb/>
and was very efficient.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06221002"/>
<p>P.G.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>10/31/07.</p>
<p>The Cuban Government had also contributed to the sanitary expenses<lb/>
of fourteen (14) other cities, in the Budget of the Fiscal Year 1906-7,<lb/>
the sum of $652,000. An additional item of $20 0000.00 appears in the<lb/>
appropriation for the office of the Secretar&iacute;a de Gobernaci&oacute;n, which<lb/>
was to be expended for the sanitation of cities at the discretion of<lb/>
the Executive. The Cuban Congress also made appropriations for a<lb/>
number of very important sanitary undertakings, such as aqueducts and<lb/>
other works of a sanitary nature. It is evident therefore that the<lb/>
important sanitary work of the Island was supported by the National<lb/>
Treasury rather than by the municipal governments as was the intention<lb/>
of the law. The entire failure of the latter in this respect was well<lb/>
recognized in Cuba, and several laws were proposed in the Cuban Congress<lb/>
looking to the nationalization of the municipal sanitary services.<lb/>
One measure at least contemplated the establishment of a secretaryship<lb/>
of Public Health which would include also the Department of Beneficencia,<lb/>
which, like the Department of Sanitation, was governed by a Superior<lb/>
Board and was intended to be autonomous, but which had suffered<lb/>
incorporation into the Secretaria of Gobernaci&oacute;n. This complete inclus-<lb/>
ion exposed both Departments alike to injurious bureaucratic and poli-<lb/>
tical influences, from which they were intended by their form of govern-<lb/>
ment to be protected.</p>
<p>Public opinion in Cuba was therefore ripe for the assumption by<lb/>
the State of the entire control in matters of municipal sanitation,<lb/>
which was effected by Decree N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 894, signed August 26th, of this year.</p>
<p>The principal objects accomplished by this law are:-</p>
<p>1. The abolition of the Municipal Boards of Health and the transfer<lb/>
of all powers previously vested in them to a national official, the<lb/>
Local Sanitary Officer, who is appointed by the highest Executive<lb/>
Authority.</p>
<p>2. The assumption by the State of the cost of all municipal sani-<lb/>
tary works and services, with the proviso that the municipal govern-<lb/>
ments shall refund to the State in consideration thereof, one tenth<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06221003"/>
P.G.<lb/>

10/31/07.<lb/>
(1/10) of their total incomes for each year.</p>
<p>3. An increase in the powers of the Chief Sanitary Officer, who<lb/>
is made in fact the administrative authority of the Department. The<lb/>
Superior Sanitary Board is at the same time reduced in number and<lb/>
authority, a majority of its members being members ex-officio of the<lb/>
National Sanitary Board. The role of the new National Sanitary Board<lb/>
will be rather advisory than administrative.</p>
<p>The yellow fever situation has been so fully discussed in the report<lb/>
of the Chief Sanitary Officer, that only a little additional comment<lb/>
is necessary. From appendix <add>No 8</add> it will be observed that the short but<lb/>
sharp little epidemic of the last three months of 1905 was limited to<lb/>
Havana. In the fall of <unclear>1906</unclear> it again invaded Havana, having obtained an<lb/>
earlier start, but was brought under control somewhat earlier. It also<lb/>
began to invade the rural municipalities.</p>
<p>The feature of this year's invasion is, the perfect control of the<lb/>
disease in Havana although frequently introduced. For cogent reasons,<lb/>
no effort has been made to prevent the importation of cases from other<lb/>
foci in the Island, and relia<add>n</add>ce has been placed upon the prompt recogni-<lb/>
tion and report of the cases with local fumigations, and particularly<lb/>
upon continuous and thorough mosquito work which has kept the city so<lb/>
free from stegomyia mosquitos that the disease is not able to spread.<lb/>
A sharp epidemic at Cienfuegos, of which the first recognized cases<lb/>
occurred early in August, was handled with such vigor and success that<lb/>
six weeks after the organization of the campaign against it, the city<lb/>
was clean of cases, and only two additional cases originating in<lb/>
Cienfuegos have occurred since the end of September.</p>
<p>Conquered in the centres of population, the disease has adopted<lb/>
revolutionary <unclear>tactiss</unclear> and taken to the woods, and this extension to the<lb/>
small towns, villages and plantations brings up new and troublesome<lb/>
problems.</p>
<p>It is certain that the work against yellow fever in Cuba is equally<lb/>
thorough in detail and on a wider scale than that conducted in Havana<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06221004"/>
P.G.<lb/>
4<lb/>
10/31/07.<lb/>
and the other more important cities in 1901.</p>
<p>Why is it not followed by the same prompt success and why did yellow<lb/>
fever at that time not hang on in the rural districts. The disease<lb/>
having been so long endemic in Cuba, the native Cuban population was then<lb/>
truly an immune one and yellow fever rarely prevailed in the interior,<lb/>
but lay in wait in the sea ports for the non-immune immigrants--who were<lb/>
as a rule not long in receiving either immunity or death. But since<lb/>
1900 this process has been checked and the non-immune population of Cuba<lb/>
has increased with great rapidity. The number of immigrants, chiefly<lb/>
Spanish, has averaged nearly 30,000 a year; in the last two years<lb/>
amounting to 88,000, and the white native population is also increasing<lb/>
with great rapidity. Accepting the doctrine of Guiteras that the white<lb/>
Cuban child is born non-immune (and the evidence in its favor is steadily<lb/>
accumulating, this still greater source of supply of non-immunes must<lb/>
be added.</p>
<p>The number of non-immunes has already become sufficient to support<lb/>
a yellow fever epidemic in almost any town or large plantation in the<lb/>
Island, and the increase of the facilities for communication by rail<lb/>
and by the construction of good public roads, together with the migratory<lb/>
habits of the Spanish laborers, furnish a ready means for the distribu-<lb/>
tion of the infection, which means existed to a far less degree six<lb/>
years ago. The sanitary forces have pursued the enemy into the country,<lb/>
and wherever a case of yellow fever has been recognized, expert diag-<lb/>
nosticians and brigades of men trained in the technique of fumigation<lb/>
and mosquito work have been sent from Havana to conduct operations<lb/>
against the enemy. These methods have kept the infection from assuming<lb/>
great proportions, but have so far failed to extinguish it. The reasons<lb/>
for this failure are two: the first is the lack of agencies for the<lb/>
discovery and reporting of cases outside of the large cities; the second,<lb/>
the lack of trained men to carry out carefully and conscientiously and<lb/>
thoroughly the work of mosquito prevention.</p>
<p>Nothing is more difficult than the recognition of mild cases of<lb/>
yellow fever. Cases constantly <unclear>occur</unclear> in patients coming into the<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06221005"/>
P.G.<lb/>
5<lb/>
10/31/07.<lb/>
Hospitals of this city, which puzzle the Board of Diagnosis of Contagious<lb/>
Diseases, probably the most distinguished body of experts in the<lb/>
knowledge of this disease in the world. Also, it must be borne in mind<lb/>
that the majority of cases, and probably in Cuban children a very large<lb/>
majority, are mild, and so <unclear>difficult</unclear> or impossible of diagnosis with<lb/>
the help of all the resources of medical science. But in the rural<lb/>
municipalities little attention is paid to attacks of fever which are<lb/>
mild or of short duration, and the physicians are not accustomed to<lb/>
employ the diagnostic aide of urinalysis and blood examinations, and<lb/>
usually have not the apparatus and technical training for so doing.<lb/>
Therefore, only the minority of grave or fatal cases are recognized and<lb/>
reported, and the infection spreads, unchecked by preventive measures<lb/>
until a death gives the alarm. So unaccustomed are the majority of Cuban<lb/>
physicians to consider any Cuban non-immune, that even when the fact is<lb/>
admitted in theory it is rarely acted on in practice--and cases of grave<lb/>
illness and even death from this disease are not infrequently diagnosed<lb/>
in this Office only by the light of subsequent cases.</p>
<p>While this Office can send trained parties to direct works of<lb/>
fumigation in recognized foci, the fundamental protection work of mosqui-<lb/>
to prevention requires permanent garrisons of trained men in every town<lb/>
and village, and even in the great sugar and tobacco plantations.</p>
<p>Such a plan of campaign can be conducted where the area is small<lb/>
and the pecuniary resources practically unlimited as in the strip 10<lb/>
miles wide and 50 miles long which constitutes the Canal Zone at Panama,<lb/>
but it is of course out of the question for the 44,000 square miles of<lb/>
Cuban territory, and far beyond the resources of the Cuban Treasury,<lb/>
for which, besides, this sanitary war is a matter quite secondary in<lb/>
importance to the great administrative works of government.</p>
<p>It is believed however to be not beyond the limits of reasonable<lb/>
expenditure to carry on a vigorous mosquito war for the next six months<lb/>
in every city, town, village and plantation in <unclear>ehich</unclear> the diseases has<lb/>
appeared this year, and this the new national sanitary organization now<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06221006"/>
P.G.<lb/>

being put into effect will give the machinery for conducting. The<lb/>
smaller towns will be taught the technical detail of mosquito work by<lb/>
frequent visits of inspection, and this will be aided by the more<lb/>
efficient conduct of the sanitary services of <unclear>street-cleaning</unclear>, removal<lb/>
of garbage etc. which are to be expected under the new organization.<lb/>
This will require operations in 29 distinct localities.</p>
<p>The importance of the yellow fever campaign has not been allowed<lb/>
to entirely overshadow other sanitary work, of which the prevention of<lb/>
tuberculosis in the larger cities and especially in Havana, is most<lb/>
important. This diseases constitutes for the Cuban population the most<lb/>
formidable of all infectious disease and causes more fatalities than<lb/>
all the other infectious diseases combined. Its alarming prevalence<lb/>
must be ascribed mainly to the excessive over-crowding which exists<lb/>
among the poorer <unclear>classes</unclear> in the cities, which evil is aggravated by<lb/>
their traditional fear of the night air, causing them to cut off<lb/>
ventilation as far as possible in the rooms where they sleep. The<lb/>
remedy for these conditions is to be found in the construction of<lb/>
sanitary dwellings at low rents, together with the social and sanitary<lb/>
education of the people. The latter is now being undertaken in con-<lb/>
nection with the Dispensary for tuberculosis maintained by the Depart-<lb/>
ment in this city, which has been entirely reorganized during the past<lb/>
year; by requiring the physicians connected with it to make domiciliary<lb/>
visits to all patients at their homes, and to instruct them in the<lb/>
methods of preventing infection, and in the importance of abundant fresh<lb/>
air and cleanliness. A Sanatorium for incipient cases has also been<lb/>
established in a good, elevated location, not far from this city.</p>
<p>Bovine tuberculosis is, fortunately, quite <unclear>rare</unclear> in Cuba, and on<lb/>
this account, and also because of the practically universal custom of<lb/>
boiling the milk in order to preserve it, milk can, contrary to the<lb/>
popular belief, be practically excluded as a source of tubercular in-<lb/>
fection.</p>
<p>It is thought to be unnecessary to invite the attention of the<lb/>
Provisional Governor to the importance of obtaining as rapidly as<lb/>

possible a water supply and sewer systems for the Cuban cities, as he<lb/>
has already demonstrated his interest in sanitary works of this<lb/>
character. I cannot refrain however from adding my recommendation to<lb/>
that of Dr. Finlay, for the execution of the plan adopted and con-<lb/>
tracted for six years ago for the sewering of Havana, and that more<lb/>
recently adopted for securing the imperatively needed water supply<lb/>
and sewer system for Cienfuegos. Whether existing contracts are in all<lb/>
respects desirable and advantageous to the public is not a matter for<lb/>
the determination of the sanitary authorities; but as to the necessity<lb/>
for the proposed works, there can be no question.</p>
