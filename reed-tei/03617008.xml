<salute>My dear Atch:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I think you have heard me talk about Mr. Moran. I hope for my<lb/>
sake that you can meet him when he comes to Charlottesville. He is a very pleasant<lb/>
Irishman and of course has a secure place (though rather obscure) in medical history,<lb/>
as one of the two who first volunteered to Reed to get experimental yellow fever.<lb/>
The part which Robert Montgomery took in the motion picture version of &ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo;<lb/>
was Mr. Moran in life. You remember I visited him in Havana. His wife is very<lb/>
pleasant but speaks very little English, being a Spaniard. He will probably be<lb/>
taken care of largely by the medical men but I do hope that you can meet him and<lb/>
make yourself known.</p>
<p>You will be interested to know that I am to receive a degree on<lb/>
the occasion of the dedication of the Lazear Memorial. As you know, I am giving<lb/>
an address and I guess they thought they had better give me a degree! Last Spring<lb/>
when I heard of the Lafayette degree, I wrote Hutch a few days later, thanking him<lb/>
most heartily for the part I assumed he had played in getting me this degree.<lb/>
I didn't know he had but suspect strongly that he had. He said he hadn't had<lb/>
anything to do about it, and in a way was very sorry about it, as the week before,<lb/>
his Board of Trustees had authorized my receiving an honorary degree at W. and J.<lb/>
Apparently, one of Father's friends nominated me to the trustees of W. and J. three<lb/>
or four years ago. The nomination was seconded recently by someone else. Hutch<lb/>
didn't tell me who. Hutch assures me that he didn't nominate me himself, but was<lb/>
just waiting for some appropriate occasion to carry out the suggestion, and this<lb/>
is it. Naturally, I am very delighted, but don't feel that I deserve one, much<lb/>
less two such honors. The affair is Friday, October 25.</p>
<p>By the way, how did your pictures of yourself and me turn out:<lb/>
You never sent me any. Mary Showalter was delighted to have the ones you sent her.</p>

<salute>Affectionately,</salute>
