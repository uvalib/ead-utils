<p>Reed's baggage has to be disinfected for &ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo; before he leaves for the States. He believes this to be an absurd formality. Reed wants to install a shower at the renovated Keewaydin house.</p>

<hi>Monday night</hi>.<lb/>
<salute>My precious wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I packed<lb/>
my trunk, this afternoon,<lb/>
and took it to Havana, in<lb/>
order to have it &amp; its con-<lb/>
tents thoroughly disinfec-<lb/>
ted preparatory to board-<lb/>
ing the Transport, Raw-<lb/>
lins, on Wednesday- You<lb/>
never saw anything like<lb/>
the care with which every<lb/>
piece of wearing apparel<lb/>
is subjected to steam or<lb/>
Formalin, for fear that<lb/>
Yellow Jack may be con-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02072002"/>
veyed to the United States-<lb/>
of course, it was absurd<lb/>
to disinfect my baggage, but<lb/>
no exceptions are made-<lb/>
Wednesday morning the con-<lb/>
tents of my valise will<lb/>
also be put in the big<lb/>
sterilizer- The Quarterm-<lb/>
aster told me, this afternoon<lb/>
that the Rawlins would be<lb/>
here Tuesday afternoon, &amp;<lb/>
would leave either Wed-<lb/>
nesday evening or Thursday<lb/>
morning- So that the chances<lb/>
of getting away August 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi><lb/>
or 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> are very good- If<lb/>
we leave on Thursday, 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi><lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02072003"/>
we will reach N.Y. Monday,<lb/>
6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; be held over in quar-<lb/>
antine till Tuesday afternoon<lb/>
the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- This would enable me<lb/>
to reach Keewaydin on Wed-<lb/>
nesday, 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- of course, I will<lb/>
telegraph when we reach N.Y,<lb/>
As my precious oomsey won't<lb/>
get this till Monday next (as<lb/>
it can't go till Wednesday the<lb/>
1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>,) I shouldn't be surprised<lb/>
if you got a telegram on the<lb/>
same day announcing our<lb/>
arrival in New York- Your<lb/>
precious letter of the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
came this morning- Another<lb/>
rain, sweetheart! <hi>two</hi><lb/>
more rains? How per-<lb/>
fectly delightful! I know<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02072004"/>
that you have been made<lb/>
more than glad to see the<lb/>
poor thirsty plants &amp; veg-<lb/>
etables turning green<lb/>
again- The news about<lb/>
the water-melons simply<lb/>
<hi>charms</hi> me! If we only<lb/>
get a good season from<lb/>
this on, I think that we can<lb/>
depend on that <hi>patch</hi><lb/>
bringing forth something<lb/>
very toothsome! Am so<lb/>
glad to hear that the last<lb/>
corn will succeed- Surely<lb/>
Mr Happle will have a plenty<lb/>
of corn to supply your wants --<lb/>
till that comes in -- nothing<lb/>
is more delicious with<lb/>
good fried chicken! and<lb/>
<hi>hot waffles</hi> for breakfast! <hi>My</hi>!!!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02072005"/>
<hi>Tuesday morning. 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi></hi>. After visions<lb/>
of chicken &amp; waffles, I simply had<lb/>
to turn into bed so as to hurry<lb/>
Tuesday along as much as possible.<lb/>
Those pansies that my darling<lb/>
wifie sent me were very<lb/>
sweet and pretty, and I ap-<lb/>
preciated them so much- But<lb/>
I am more anxious to see them<lb/>
with my own eyes as they<lb/>
grow at dear Keewaydin.<lb/>
Tomorrow or next day, I<lb/>
shall begin my homeward<lb/>
sea-voyage, and I hope<lb/>
without being very sick, es-<lb/>
pecially as the sea has been<lb/>
so quiet this summer-<lb/>
Here Mr Ramon Fong comes<lb/>
in to say, &ldquo;Good morning, <hi>dotter</hi>&rdquo;!<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02072006"/>
and his small eyes fairly dance!<lb/>
He has turned out to be<lb/>
<hi>Chinese</hi> and not <hi>Japanese</hi><lb/>
as we had supposed- Isn't<lb/>
it funny that we should have<lb/>
all been so fooled by his looks!<lb/>
He is as bright and smart as<lb/>
can be &amp; is learning English<lb/>
very fast- I am teaching &amp; cor-<lb/>
recting him every day- He no lon-<lb/>
ger says &ldquo;bom bye&rdquo;, but &ldquo;after<lb/>
a leetle while&rdquo;!) It's very funny<lb/>
to hear him talk- Knows lots<lb/>
of spanish &amp; rattles <add>off</add> chinese<lb/>
like a steam engine- Save a little<lb/>
of the <hi>mint</hi> for me, dearest, and<lb/>
have an extra supply of <hi>old<lb/>
Crow</hi> on hand by August 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.<lb/>
How delighted I am at the thought<lb/>
of seeing my precious babies again.<lb/>
Love to Sis Mottsey- Love and kisses<lb/>
for my precious wifie &amp; Daughter -- Devotedly,<lb/>
Papa.</p>

August 1, 1900</p>
<p><hi>No. 27<lb/>
Wednesday Morning</hi>,</p>
<p>My precious wifie:</p>
<p>The Trans-<lb/>
port hadn't arrived at half<lb/>
past five, last evening, al-<lb/>
though it was expected at<lb/>
any time- It is not yet <add>seven</add> <del>six</del><lb/>
o'clock &amp; hence too early to<lb/>
find out by telephone<lb/>
whether she came in du-<lb/>
ring the night- I shall<lb/>
go down, this morning, to<lb/>
Havana, with my valise<lb/>
to find out more definitely-<lb/>
If she is there I shall leave<lb/>
my valise at the disin-<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02072008"/>
fecting station- It seems that<lb/>
the Rawlins had to go first<lb/>
to Matanzas, &amp; this delayed<lb/>
her arrival at Havana,<lb/>
It is one <add>of</add> those genuine<lb/>
United States <hi>rainy</hi> morn-<lb/>
ings, such as I <add>have</add> not seen<del>s</del><lb/>
in Cuba before- Looks as<lb/>
if it would rain all day<lb/>
long- Just a good steady<lb/>
though somewhat gentle,<lb/>
downpour- The kind of<lb/>
day that one will need<lb/>
an umbrella &amp; fortunately<lb/>
I have one- I am expecting<lb/>
several sweet letters<lb/>
from my darling children<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02072009"/>
this morning, and hence I am<lb/>
wishing that the mail-man<lb/>
would hurry up. Yesterday<lb/>
I took it very slowly, es-<lb/>
pecially as the bromide<lb/>
had made me so very sleepy.<lb/>
I lay down after lunch and<lb/>
slept till four o'clock, and<lb/>
got up still feeling sleepy,<lb/>
My shower-bath, this morning,<lb/>
has helped me to get awake,<lb/>
I don't think, sweetheart,<lb/>
that there ever was such<lb/>
an institution as a good<lb/>
shower-bath -- not <hi>overhead</hi>,<lb/>
but the spray coming from<lb/>
the side so that your head<lb/>
doesn't get wet at all.<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02072010"/>
You can depend upon it that<lb/>
the enlarged &amp; completed<lb/>
Keewaydin is going to have<lb/>
one, if we can get together<lb/>
enough money to put up<lb/>
the fixtures -- and I think that<lb/>
we can- I will now hurry<lb/>
this short letter to an end<lb/>
and if I can write another<lb/>
note from Havana to go<lb/>
off before 12 o'clock, I<lb/>
will do so- I think that No.<lb/>
27 will be the last letter<lb/>
for the present- Unless there<lb/>
should be some delay at this<lb/>
end of the line. If we don't go<lb/>
until tomorrow, I may write a short<lb/>
note that can follow me- Boo! Boo!<lb/>
you precious joy- Love to aunt Jane. Kiss<lb/>
Fat joy 20 times for me- Kisses &amp; love for my<lb/>
babies.</p>
