His Excellency,<lb/>
Dr. Domingo Ramos,<lb/>
Minister of National Defense,<lb/>
Government of Cuba.<lb/>
(Through Dr. P. S. Hench).<lb/>
<salute>Your Excellency:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have carefully reviewed the documentary summary<lb/>
prepared by Dr. Philip S. Hench regarding the historical sites of<lb/>
&ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo; and the Columbia Barracks Yellow Fever Hospital (1900).<lb/>
As I was on duty at the Columbia Barracks Hospital from August 17,<lb/>
1899 until November 30, 1900 (with the exception of a short period<lb/>
in the Summer of 1900), I am thoroughly familiar with the location<lb/>
of those sites and with what transpired there while the Reed Board<lb/>
was conducting its yellow fever experiments.</p>
<p>I made several trips to Camp Lazear with Major Reed<lb/>
while the camp was being constructed and am thoroughly familiar with<lb/>
its location on the &ldquo;San Jose Farm&rdquo; owned at the time by Se&ntilde;or Rojas.<lb/>
Dr. Hench has positively located it and, from his description of the<lb/>
old building occupied by Se&ntilde;or Zunzunegui, I feel quite certain that<lb/>
he has definitely located the &ldquo;Infected Clothing Building&rdquo; used in<lb/>
the yellow fever experiments in 1900.</p>
<p>Major Reed occupied the two rooms adjacent to mine<lb/>
in the doctors' quarters at the hospital and, as I was the Commanding<lb/>
Officer of the hospital (during September, October and November 1900),<lb/>
I was called upon by Major Reed for much assistance in the way of<lb/>
personnel, medical supplies and equipment for Camp Lazear.</p>
<p>Dr. Roger Post Ames was serving directly under me<lb/>
at that time and had charge of our yellow fever wards near the South-<lb/>
western borders of the hospital grounds.</p>
<p>The deep cut of the La Playa railroad, running in a<lb/>
Northwesterly direction through the hospital grounds, made the far<lb/>
side of this excavation an excellent place for isolating and treating<lb/>
yellow fever cases. It was used for that purpose during all the time<lb/>
I was there. Dr. Hench has very exactly shown this location on the<lb/>
maps and in other data he has presented. Major J. R. Kean, Dr.<lb/>
Carroll and many others were treated there. Dr. Jesse W. Lazear<lb/>
died there.</p>

His Excellency Dr. Domingo Ramos.</p>
<p>It gives me much pleasure therefore to give you,<lb/>
for the information of the Cuban Government, the facts regarding<lb/>
this matter. I am also pleased to help Dr. Hench in his worthy<lb/>
efforts to assist you in establishing a fitting memorial to the<lb/>
great men whose discoveries did so much for Cuba and the rest of<lb/>
the world. If I can be of further assistance in any way, I am<lb/>
at your service.</p>
