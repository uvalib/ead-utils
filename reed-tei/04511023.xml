<p>Rath informs Hench that the National Trust for Historic Preservation does not deem it possible to take ownership of the Quinta San Jose, as Rojas would prefer, but will cooperate with preservation efforts. He thinks any preservation association must be chartered in Cuba, but might have strong American representation.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I know that you will be interested to hear about the results<lb/>
of the discussion of Quinta San Jose and associated problems at the<lb/>
recent Trustees meeting. The Trustees of the National Trust felt that<lb/>
it would be possible for them to cooperate informally with the indi-<lb/>
viduals and any group that might be formed to assure the preservation<lb/>
of Quinta San Jose. They did not deem it possible to consider, how-<lb/>
ever, outright ownership by the National Trust, which was a tentative<lb/>
suggestion of Senora Rojas.</p>
<p>I cannot say clearly how far along the line toward an even-<lb/>
tual solution this brings us. The situation in Cuba is confused. I<lb/>
have not yet heard from Senora Rojas in regard to the study that Dr.<lb/>
Saladrigas was to make of the present thought on Building No. 1. Al-<lb/>
though it is somewhat <unclear>academic.</unclear> I think that the future may bring<lb/>
about this situation: If the Cuban government abandons its plans for<lb/>
a memorial at the land surrounding Building No. 1 and is willing to<lb/>
give that building to Senora Rojas to re-erect on a portion of Quinta<lb/>
San Jose, some association should be formed to assure the permanent<lb/>
preservation of the estate. I think necessarily this must be an<lb/>
association chartered in Cuba but that its base can be broadened by<lb/>
having a strong American representation. As I see it, Senora Rojas<lb/>
would make provision that <hi>this association would</hi> receive the entire<lb/>
<hi>estate, plus an endowment, for</hi> establishment as a Cuban-American mu-<lb/>
<hi>seum. Informally, we shall be willing to</hi> participate in order to en-<lb/>
courage such a movement and, within our means, offer direct technical<lb/>
assistance upon request. In the near future, I shall outline the pro-<lb/>
blem and the potential solutions from our point of view to Senora<lb/>
Rojas.</p>

<p>May 23, 1952</p>
<p>In accordance with our understanding, I am enclosing a state-<lb/>
ment of expenses incurred for the Jacksonville to Havana phase of my<lb/>
recent trip. A check may be made out directly to the National Council<lb/>
for Historic Sites and Buildings and is deductible for income tax pur-<lb/>
poses. I shall take the liberty of considering it a contribution for<lb/>
membership in the National Council during the forthcoming year.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to you for the opportunity presented, not<lb/>
only to deal with a problem in this field, which may yet be solved, but<lb/>
also to meet some fine people. I shall look forward to hearing from you<lb/>
in the near future.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours</salute>
