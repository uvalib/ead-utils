<salute>The Esteemed Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It gave us great pleasure to receive your letter after so long a time with-<lb/>
out having news of you. We admire the enthusiasm and tenacity with which<lb/>
you persist in carrying out your plans in memory of Camp Lazear, in spite<lb/>
of the difficulties and obstacles due to the war, and we do not doubt that<lb/>
you will be able to accomplish them.</p>
<p>When I received your letter, I went to visit the little house, fearing,<lb/>
like you, that the hurricane would have caused considerable damage, finding<lb/>
with surprise that it had not suffered at all, which is really miraculous,<lb/>
since this cyclone was the strongest or the worst that we have suffered in<lb/>
many years. The garden of the little place is totally destroyed; even many<lb/>
of the great trees have fallen and those that remain standing lost all their<lb/>
limbs. If you were to see it now, you would not recognize it.</p>
<p>We left the house in Vedado and have come to live on the farm. In this<lb/>
way we can take better care of the house.</p>
<p>If there is anything that we can do for you, do not hesitate to tell us,<lb/>
since we are very glad to do all we can to carry out your plans.</p>
<p>We congratulate you sincerely on the new member of the family. Begging you<lb/>
to extend to Mrs. Hench our sincere congratulations and with regards from<lb/>
my Mother and Senorita Cabrera, receive a friendly greeting from</p>
<closer>
