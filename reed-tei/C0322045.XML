<p>Carter suggests that Brown's salary be continued through October even though Brown has offered to work for free. She also thanks Russell for facilitating repayments of advances that she and Henry Rose Carter made towards Theodore Hayne's medical education as the work and her health have affected her finances adversely.</p>

<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This is just to say that the work on the bibliography of<lb/>
the History of Yellow Fever is being so pressed at present, in expec-<lb/>
tation of Dr. Frost calling for the verified references, that I do not<lb/>
feel that you would wish me to take time therefrom to go into the de-<lb/>
tails of what has been accomplished since my last letter to you. I<lb/>
shall only state that Miss Brown and I have done much successful work<lb/>
and have put in all the time we possibly could, including night work<lb/>
and Sundays. I am, however, being very careful to avoid another break-<lb/>
down, as I certainly <hi>must</hi> &ldquo;last&rdquo; this time until the book is finished.</p>
<p>In connection with Miss Brown's work: she told me yesterday<lb/>
that she does not expect a salary after this month, although she in-<lb/>
tends to continue to work with me until the bibliography is ready to<lb/>
go to press, and <add>&ldquo;</add> to work just as hard as heretofore.<add>&rdquo;</add> It would seem to<lb/>
me, however, provided you see it as I do, that it would be no more than<lb/>
fair that her salary continue until the end of October instead of stop-<lb/>
ping, as she suggests, at the end of September. Miss Brown will be<lb/>
working for us all of the month of October <add>(and later)</add> and she is now so well up<lb/>
on what needs to be done that, even when I run over to Baltimore to<lb/>
work with Dr. Frost, she can &ldquo;carry on&rdquo; most satisfactorily by herself.<lb/>
Indeed, much of our night work is now done apart, only, of course, I go<lb/>
over and verify her findings with her <del>later.</del><add>before we mark the refs. as completed.</add> Miss Brown has done, and<lb/>
is doing, <hi>beautiful</hi> work and, of course, has given us far more of her<lb/>
time than either she or I anticipated when we started in together.<lb/>
Had she not done so, the bibliography would be far less near completion,<lb/>
as there was a tremendous mass of literature to be gone over, in six lan-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0322046"/>
-2-<lb/>
lan-<lb/>
guages, and only her exceptional equipment for the task, combined with<lb/>
hard work: enthusiasm and long hours on both our parts could have brought<lb/>
the work to its present state in the comparatively short time we have<lb/>
been working together. When one considers in addition what a horror the<lb/>
past summer has been I cannot adequately express my appreciation of <del>what</del><lb/>
all that Miss Brown has done.</p>
<p>By the way, and <unclear>a</unclear> propos of deep appreciation, I had intended<lb/>
sooner to mention having heard from Theodore Hayne, just prior to his<lb/>
sailing for West Africa, telling me of the arrangements he had made with<lb/>
you for the repayments, from his monthly salary, of the money advanced<lb/>
him by Father and myself for his medical education. I hope that Theodore<lb/>
is not making these monthly payments larger than is convenient to him, for<lb/>
it would have been a <hi>privelege</hi> to help such a man get a start under any<lb/>
conditions. I must admit, however, that the money is a God-send at pres-<lb/>
ent, as not only have I long been under heavy expense, on account of<lb/>
sickness and other emergencies, but also it naturally costs far more to<lb/>
live when one is below par physically and has to save oneself <hi>entirely</hi> for<lb/>
one's work. However, in using Theodore's money, although I am going into<lb/>
my capital thereby, at least I am not going invested capital, as I had to<lb/>
do when I was sick. It is almost a miracle then to have these repayments<lb/>
start at this particular time and I am most grateful, not only to Theodore<lb/>
for being so generous in the amount of his salary assigned for this pur-<lb/>
pose, but to yourself for making the present system of repayment possible.</p>
<p>I congratulate both the I. H. D. and Theodore Hayne on the<lb/>
present connection. Father and I thought the world of him, indeed Father<lb/>
considered him the finest and the ablest of the young men with whom he<lb/>
was associated in the latter years of his field work.</p>
<p>I hope that you can let me know a day or so in advance when you<lb/>
contemplate coming to Washington, as I generally start to the Library be-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fC0322047"/>
be-<lb/>
-3-<lb/>
fore the morning's mail is delivered<unclear>:</unclear> long training with Father having<lb/>
accustomed me to early rising and to starting work as soon thereafter<lb/>
as may be. This, by the way, is one reason why it is so hard to find<lb/>
time for my weekly reports to you. I cannot use my typewriter before goi<lb/>
to the Library, lest I wake my neighbors, and I am so dead tired on my<lb/>
return that a letter written then would probably be satisfactory to<lb/>
neither of us.</p>
<p>With very best remembrances, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>
