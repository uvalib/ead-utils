Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
Mayo Clinic,<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your letter of April 26th about the presentation at<lb/>
the Cuban Embassy. I had received a telegram from them inviting me<lb/>
to the ceremony, also a telephone <add>call</add> from the Secretary asking that I<lb/>
be present to receive the medal. In the meantime, the two surviving<lb/>
sisters had heard about the medal about to be presented and when I<lb/>
arrived at the Embassy, they were both there and fussing between<lb/>
themselves as to which one should receive it. I was rather embarrassed<lb/>
because I had told the Secretary I would be there to receive the honor.<lb/>
It turned out that the oldest daughter was the one to receive it but<lb/>
she asked that her daughter be given the privilege in her place. The<lb/>
Secretary talked with me afterwards about the matter and told how they<lb/>
both had come there early and changed the plans. Being an in-law, it<lb/>
seems the sisters were of the opinion I had no right to receive the<lb/>
honor. It was alright with me but if I had known of the arrangements<lb/>
I would not have attended for I felt left &ldquo;out of the fold&rdquo;. But you<lb/>
know how families <add>are</add> about <unclear>somethings</unclear>. The ceremony was very nice and<lb/>
I met the Ambassador and the Dr. to whom you referred and a Miss Batista<lb/>
and all were very gracious to me.</p>
<p>One thing I could not understand, however, was why each of Dr. Reed's<lb/>
children received a medal while the others got only one to a family. The<lb/>
sisters-in-law were very much upset because the Ambassador said that Drs.<lb/>
Handberry and Cooke were the <hi>first</hi> who voluntarily submitted to a mos-<lb/>
quito bit for they said their father was the first one. So the argument<lb/>
goes on and I get weary of their wrangling about it.</p>
<p>I was sorry to hear of your illness and that you could not attend<lb/>
the ceremony but I hope you are very much improved by this time.</p>
<p>On April 9th, just six months and two days after losing my husband<lb/>
my dear mother passed away. She was ill only fi<del>v</del>ve days and I am thank-<lb/>
ful that she did not suffer too long. She was 78 but was very active and<lb/>
had been down town the day she took sick. I just do not know how much a<lb/>
human being can stand for it seems that I cannot go on. I am under the<lb/>
Drs. care again, having a bladder infection just now which is quite<lb/>
painful.</p>
<p>Have you had time to inquire about the foot operation we discussed<lb/>
when you were here? I would like to know the approximate cost before I<lb/>
would decide to make the trip to the Mayo Clinic, in the event I have<lb/>
the operation done. My feet are worse than they were but I am almost<lb/>
afraid to have any-thing done at my age.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for the book you so kindly sent me. I have not<lb/>
had an opportunity to read it as I have been with my brother since my<lb/>
mother's death and just returned home last week.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f05808056"/>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>Please refer to the last paragraph of you letter of April <unclear>26th</unclear><lb/>
saying that you had sent copies of the photographs to two or three<lb/>
of the survivors of the yellow fever experiments and will let me know<lb/>
what they say. I would not want you to mention to the sisters of my<lb/>
husband that I let you go through those papers when you were here for<lb/>
they are so opposed to letting any one see them. As I explained to<lb/>
you, I am willing to cooperate and would like to have the correct<lb/>
story told about their father's work but I do not have the right,<lb/>
according to my lawyer, to release the papers without the written<lb/>
consent of both sisters. They contend that <unclear>their</unclear> father got a raw<lb/>
deal and that they are going to write the truth and <unclear>meanwhile</unclear> time<lb/>
<unclear>goes</unclear> on and one after another passes away and nothing has been<lb/>
done. I have decided not to bother any more about the matter. If<lb/>
I had children, I surely would do all I could to rectify the error,<lb/>
in the event there was one.</p>
<p>About the photographs, perhaps it would be better for you to mail<lb/>
them to me so that I can put them with the other papers so that the<lb/>
sisters can see them if they should visit me this summer. They did<lb/>
not come to the house when they were here for the ceremony as I was<lb/>
having remodeling work done and was staying with my brother in Va.<lb/>
and could not accomodate them. But they warned me over and over<lb/>
not to let any one have access to those papers.</p>
<p>You understand my position about this affair and until I get<lb/>
my sanity back or some resemblance thereto, I do not want to have<lb/>
any hard feelings in the family. I feel that I have had more than<lb/>
my share of sorrow, having lost two loved one in six months. I<lb/>
wonder what there is to this cruel old life but being a Christian,<lb/>
I know that I will have to stay here until my time comes.</p>
<p>I forgot to tell you in discussing the ceremony that this was<lb/>
the first time I had met Dr. Reed's children. I talked with them<lb/>
a few minutes and they were friendly enough (in a <unclear>condes<add><unclear></unclear></add>ending</unclear> way)<lb/>
but I feel that I am as good as they are even of their father got<lb/>
all the fame and glory.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in letting me lnow about this<lb/>
ceremony and wishing you a speedy recovery, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Mrs. George S. H. Carroll</signed>.
(Please excuse the numerous<lb/>
mistakes but I am very<lb/>
nervous and cannot type<lb/>
well)<lb/>
