<salute>My dear Colonel Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Do you remember the conversation<lb/>
which Alice when she was in Wonderland<lb/>
had with the melancholy mouse? Mine<lb/>
is a long and a sad tale said the mouse.<lb/>
I see that it is long but why is it sad?<lb/>
said Alice. So my tale is sad but I will<lb/>
try not to make it too long. Your good<lb/>
letter of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> with the pictures of the room<lb/>
in which Major Reed died came about the<lb/>
15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Of course I will be glad to coin a phrase<lb/>
for the tablet. It is chiefly a matter of counting,<lb/>
not words, but <hi>letters</hi> as we were required<lb/>
to do in the inscriptions for the Jefferson
memo-<lb/>
rial, where the architect was a stern task-<lb/>
master and there was the severe limitation<lb/>
that we had to use the exact words of<lb/>
T.J. who was a free spender of words as<lb/>
of money. I think your suggestion as<lb/>
to the inscription is excellent, but I<lb/>
have not yet counted the letters. Do you<lb/>
know that the phrase &ldquo;He gave to man<lb/>
control over that dreadful plague yellow<lb/>
fever&rdquo; was the citation that President<lb/>
Elliott of Harvard (a master of words) put<lb/>
as the citation of the degree conferred by him<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06413153"/>
2<lb/>
as President of Harvard University. <del>He</del><add>Reed</add> went<lb/>
on to receive it and it pleased him more<lb/>
than any other honor conferred on him<lb/>
in his life-time. It came to me as his<lb/>
best friend in the S.G.O. to have charge of his<lb/>
funeral and to select, as the Q.M. Dept. permitted<lb/>
me to do, the location of his grave. Mrs Reed<lb/>
agreed with me that this admirable phase<lb/>
should be the inscription on his tomb <unclear>stone</unclear><lb/>
and it is there today. I think that it<lb/>
would be admirable for the Am. Soc. of<lb/>
Tropical medicine to give a bronze tablet, in<lb/>
which case they would make the inscription.<lb/>
If the building should be pulled down<lb/>
it should be placed in an appropriate<lb/>
place, on another building on the same location<lb/>
or in a museum.</p>
<p>Returning to the date when your letter came:<lb/>
We have had in Wash. a near-epidemic of a<lb/>
severe form of influenza of the virus type. I<lb/>
came down with it about the time your letter<lb/>
arrived, and my desk was piled high with<lb/>
cards and letters. I was in bed 4 days and<lb/>
had a slow and languid convalescence.<lb/>
Meanwhile my wife Cornelia came down<lb/>
on the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> with a much more severe form<lb/>
and is now still in bed, tho improving.<lb/>
We spent a most unhappy Christmas. We<lb/>
could not get a doctor till next day. He said<lb/>
there was no pneumonia or other complication<lb/>
except the inevitable bronchitis which is still with<lb/>
her.</p>
<p>I must stop here. My only chance to get this in todays mail is the part-time maid<lb/>
who is now going and cannot be stayed. Cornelia is now improving.</p>

P.S. to letter of 29 Dec. '47<lb/>
Dear Col. Hench<lb/>
When I had my long and sad tale'<lb/>
cut short this morning. I forgot one<lb/>
thing which I had in mind to tell you.<lb/>
Mrs. Franck came to see us recently<lb/>
to bring Mrs Kean some copies which<lb/>
she had made of a paper for her.<lb/>
I asked her casually if she had heard<lb/>
from you recently and she replied that she<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06413155"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
had not, she had not even learned if her<lb/>
work had been satisfactory. I said<lb/>
that you had been away from your office<lb/>
a good deal recently and that you were<lb/>
an extremely busy man, and suggested that<lb/>
she send you a note to ask if the MSS had<lb/>
been received and was satisfactory. She<lb/>
seemed to have some hesitation about doing<lb/>
so however, so I told her I would mention it<lb/>
when I wrote to you. &lsquo;Nuf Sed&rsquo; as our colored<lb/>
citizens would say.<lb/>
Cordially yours<lb/>
J.R. Kean<lb/>
