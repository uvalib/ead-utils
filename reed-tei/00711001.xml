<salute>Dear Ma:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Well this is my birthday &amp; exactly<lb/>
how old I am I do not know - nearly 40 I think-<lb/>
I cannot but think how unsettled my life has been for the<lb/>
past ten years, &amp; what a struggle for the past <del>5</del><add>4</add> or <del>6</del><add>or 5</add>: <unclear>It</unclear><lb/>
isn't not well to get older &amp; not to feel more self-confidence<lb/>
or development of mental strength: especially not to feel<lb/>
more content or settled. However there are many things<lb/>
&ldquo;not well&rdquo;, &amp; <unclear>god</unclear> will govern it as seems right - nay as is right.<lb/>
<unclear>Ed</unclear> still requires a good deal of extra care; but we<lb/>
don't mind that so long as it is successful in keeping<lb/>
the little <unclear>fellow</unclear> from getting sick again.</p>
<p>He takes the greatest interest in the boats &amp; is perfectly<lb/>
happy when he can go rowing &amp; hang over the side &amp; put<lb/>
his hand in the water.</p>
<p><del><unclear>We</unclear></del> I have had quite a <unclear>run of vessels</unclear> recently<lb/>
the latter part of <del>last</del> week <add>before last</add> &amp; the beginning of last week<lb/>
were very <unclear>hard</unclear>, I had 5 ships in (7800 tons in all) the<lb/>
largest I have had this season Saturday I went out<lb/>
at 5. A.M. &amp; got back at 8.30 P.M. coming in once<lb/>
only after a barrel of sulphur. The danger from Rio is<lb/>
<hi>about</hi> <unclear>past</unclear> &amp; that from Havana has pretty well begun.<lb/>
also a good deal of fever on the N. coast of S. America: <unclear>Cathegena<lb/>
La Guijra</unclear> &amp; Boca del Toro. Got in my 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> lot of Chagres<lb/>
Fever (Panama) last week; 4 cases-all of whom recovered<lb/>
I have had no man die under my care since I came to Quar-<lb/>
antine<unclear>-out</unclear> of 147 patients in hospital &amp; many light cases<lb/>
aboard ship - but one man died when I had dysentery last<lb/>
summer (Aug 26) who I suppose would have died had I<lb/>
been able to see him, since the failure of the Panama<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00711002"/>
C1<lb/>
B23<lb/>
Canal there are few ships from Colon (<unclear>Aspin wall</unclear>) &amp; hence much<lb/>
less sickness than last year &amp; the work on the Niciragua Canal had<lb/>
not begun enough to make much <unclear>shipping-</unclear> although about<lb/>
1/2 doz schooners have left Mobile &amp; <unclear>Pascagoula with lum<lb/>
ber for Graytown</unclear> &amp; I suppose I will have an opportunity<lb/>
to investigate the Central American fevers by the end of Sept-<lb/>
ember. However a good <unclear>part - the hardest part</unclear> of the quar-<lb/>
antine has <unclear>passed</unclear>: everything works smoothly enough now &amp;<lb/>
there are only 2 to 2 1/2 months more, depending on the <unclear>fall</unclear>,<lb/>
And although the most dangerous time <add>for fever</add> here is from Aug 15 to Oct<lb/>
20., still the <hi>work</hi> is heaviest in the beginning.</p>
<p>I suppose you know almost as much about the Refuge sta-<lb/>
tion at <unclear>Chandelier</unclear> as I do mother but it is what I mainly think<lb/>
<unclear></unclear>about. As to personal matters, after the season is over I want to<lb/>
go to Fla - by Mobile &amp; have some teeth pulled &amp; see after the<lb/>
little grove. I will have paid <unclear>$26.00</unclear>, by Sept. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> &amp; <unclear>$4.00</unclear> I<lb/>
borrowed <unclear>from Hill.</unclear> This would finish payment but for <unclear>$41.</unclear><lb/>
spent for fertilizers &amp; some for prunning &amp; <unclear>Cow-peat</unclear>. How-<lb/>
ever <hi>all</hi> will be paid by Oct 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>, &amp; I can pay back the <unclear>$4.00</unclear><lb/>
in a little while. I want to put <unclear>out</unclear> <del>10</del> 8 acres more,<lb/>
(that were put in <unclear>peas</unclear> this year) in oranges &amp; <unclear>lemons</unclear> &amp;<lb/>
to get up 4 acres ready for <unclear>peas next. summer, that</unclear><lb/>
is about all the cleared land except the 2 1/2 acres in <unclear>game<lb/>
on</unclear> the place. If I can - the travelling expenses came in heavily just<lb/>
<unclear>now</unclear>- I will come <unclear>on then</unclear> to Va: although I would have but a<lb/>
short time to <unclear>stay.</unclear> still a short stay will be worth a great<lb/>

deal to me.</p>
<p>As to refusing my <unclear>[?]</unclear> there was no chance to make<lb/>
a question of it. It was all one sided. It had been wrong,<lb/>
unprofitable &amp; unpleasant to have taken it. Although <unclear>there sh'd</unclear><lb/>
I have gave?</p>
<p>I am glad that the house will be <unclear>tinned</unclear> the</p>
