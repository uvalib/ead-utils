Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>
Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Rochester, Minn<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you so much for your letter of October 8th advising me that the<lb/>
date for the dedication of Camp Lazear had been postponed to December 3rd.<lb/>
I had just seen Dr. Soper who had attended the International Congresses in<lb/>
Havana and had assumed from my conversation with him that the date of the<lb/>
dedication had been postponed and I am delighted to learn just when it is<lb/>
to be held.</p>
<p>I regret so much the difficulty you are having with the people in<lb/>
Cuba to use facts in connection with the dedication and I do hope that they<lb/>
will not persist in gicing Dr. Finlay all the credit for everything.</p>
<p>I am so sorry that it will not be possible for you to attend the an-<lb/>
nual meeting of the Walter Reed Memorial Association this year. I had at<lb/>
first thought it might be desirable to eliminate the meeting for this<lb/>
year because of the fact that you could not attend and that there was no<lb/>
particular business to be brought up. However, in talking with General<lb/>
Love, I learned he had just received our annual report of income from the<lb/>
bank and he advises me that the income for the past year has been $1400.<lb/>
In view of the fact that Blossom Reed's income has been materially reduced<lb/>
since her mother's death and she gets only $84 to $85 a month at the present<lb/>
time, we feel that it will be desirable to increase her income to $100 a<lb/>
month. We will take this matter up at the annual meeting but I would appre-<lb/>
ciate it very much if you would let me know if you concur in this increased<lb/>
monthly payment to Blossom.</p>
<p>I hope that the Surgeon General will be able to go down for the dedi-<lb/>
cation on December 9th and if not that he will certainly send General Streit.<lb/>
As you undoubtedly know, it will be impossible for Gen. and Mrs. Reed to<lb/>
attend because of General Reed's health and Blossom has advised us that it<lb/>
will not be possible for her to go either.</p>
<p>With best regards,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
