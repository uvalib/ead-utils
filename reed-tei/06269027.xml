FROM GEN. J. R. KEAN<lb/>
<dateline>
<date value="1925-04-23">April 23, 1925.</date>
</dateline>
Dr. R. A. Amador,<lb/>
Legacion de Panama,<lb/>
Paris, France.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Amador:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It was indeed a great pleasure to get your letter<lb/>
of the 5th and I felt like I had met again an old friend.</p>
<p>I think it is an admirable idea for you to write<lb/>
a pamphlet to let the people at Panama know that in the<lb/>
yellow fever work Reed was the leader whom all followed and<lb/>
his an original work. As Gorgas himself wrote to Reed in<lb/>
August, 1901, his credit was only that of the man who first<lb/>
applied Reed's discoveries on a large scale.</p>
<p>Yes, I know the story of &ldquo;X.Y.&rdquo; I looked him up<lb/>
a number of years ago when I was in the Surgeon General's<lb/>
Office and found out his name and diagnosis. I am sorry to<lb/>
say I have forgotten the name but I remember perfectly well<lb/>
the other facts. Your memory has played you a trick in think-<lb/>
ing that he had a <unclear>brokenffemur</unclear>. The trouble was much less<lb/>
serious, namely gonorrhea. When Lazear went into the ward<lb/>
with his mosquitoes and asked who would be willing to feed<lb/>
them, this cavalryman &ldquo;X.Y.&rdquo; volunteered. The man was about<lb/>
ready for duty and was returned to duty the next day by the<lb/>
Ward Surgeon who did not know of this incident. He came back<lb/>
the next week with fever which you correctly diagnosed yellow<lb/>
fever. When Reed came back from the United States where he<lb/>
was at this time, he went to see this man and tried to get<lb/>
him to admit that while he was on duty he had broken the<lb/>
quarantine and gone to Quemados. Reed even offered him a<lb/>
twenty-dollar gold piece if he would admit it but the cavalry-<lb/>
man said &ldquo;I would like to have your twenty-dollar gold piece<lb/>
but I do not see how it would help you for me to tell a lie,<lb/>
and I did not leave the camp&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The book written by Prof. Howard Kelly is called<lb/>
&ldquo;Walter Reed and Yellow Fever&rdquo;. He got out a new edition<lb/>
last year.</p>

<p>FROM GEN. J. R. KEAN</p>
<p>It is a great pleasure to hear from you and I<lb/>
hope that if you come to Washington you will be sure to<lb/>
look me up. When you write your pamphlet, I hope you<lb/>
will not fail to send me a copy.</p>
<p>With best wishes, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
