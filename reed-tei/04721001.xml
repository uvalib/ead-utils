ADDRESS OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS TO<lb/>
THE SECRETARY OF STATE<lb/>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just received a letter from the American Embassy at<lb/>
Habana concerning the keen interest of the Cuban Government and<lb/>
medical fraternity in defending and substantiating a claim that<lb/>
Dr. Carlos J. Finlay was the first proponent of the theory that<lb/>
yellow fever is caused by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito.</p>
<p>The Cubans have heard that, at a world medical meeting<lb/>
scheduled to take place in Rome, in November 1954, the French<lb/>
delegation is preparing to present a resolution to the effect<lb/>
that a French doctor was the original discoverer of this medical<lb/>
fact.</p>
<p>I understand that since 1939 you have been collecting data<lb/>
on the work of Dr. Finlay, that you have made several trips to<lb/>
Cuba and that you were actually responsible for rediscovering the<lb/>
site of Camp Lazear where Major Walter Reed and his associates<lb/>
worked out experiments which proved the veracity of Dr. Finlay's<lb/>
theory. I believe that you stated, in an article which you wrote<lb/>
in May 1948, that Dr. Finlay had been trying for nineteen years<lb/>
to convince his medical colleagues that yellow fever was carried<lb/>
by a mosquito.</p>
<p>Since you must possess authoritative knowledge of the accomplish-<lb/>
ments of Dr. Finlay, you would undoubtedly be able to provide evi-<lb/>
dence which would support the Cuban assertion. I mention this to<lb/>
you in the hope that you may find it possible to do this in the<lb/>
interests of relations between Cuba and the United States to which<lb/>
you have already made great contributions.</p>
<p>I believe that you must be the same Dr. Hench whom I had the<lb/>
privilege of meeting in Stockholm when you received the Nobel Prize.<lb/>
If so, it is a double pleasure to write to you on this subject.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>

for Inter-American Affairs<lb/>
