<salute>My Dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your very interesting letter about<lb/>
Dr. Hench Lazear came on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp;<lb/>
I gave it to Ireland next day- He<lb/>
brought it back next day &amp; said he<lb/>
saw no reason why you should with-<lb/>
hold anything in it from Dr. Hench.<lb/>
It is also my opinion, and my comments<lb/>
are of no great importance- Here they <unclear>are.</unclear><lb/>
In 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> line 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> paragraph you have Gen. Lee's<lb/>
Hdqrs Dept of Pinar del Rio which of course<lb/>
should be <hi>Havana and</hi> Pinar del Rio,<lb/>
Camp Columbia being in Havana Province-<lb/>
In the next line Gen Fitzhugh Lee's name<lb/>
is spelled <hi>Fitzhue</hi> which was of course<lb/>
the <unclear>stenog's</unclear> slip-</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06284030"/>
<p><hi>2</hi></p>
<p>In 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> line bottom par- 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> page October <hi>1</hi>, 1900<lb/>
should be Oct. <hi>4</hi> 1900. I get from my diary<lb/>
that on Oct. 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> I was in Matanzas <unclear>on</unclear> an<lb/>
inspection trip &amp; in the evening went on<lb/>
board the transport Crook, which was in<lb/>
harbor, to see Reed &amp; talked with him about<lb/>
Lazear's death- He landed in Havana the<lb/>
next morning as no ship could pass the<lb/>
Morro until sunrise- My diary notes a long<lb/>
talk with Reed on 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> in which he told me<lb/>
the story of Lazear being bitten by a wild<lb/>
mosquito at Las Animas and I have<lb/>
always accepted that account until I<lb/>
talked with you here in Washington<lb/>
since my retirement- It was I who<lb/>
told Dr. Hench that he should get in<lb/>
communication with you- You saw much<lb/>
more than I did of Reed at that time<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06284031"/>
<hi>3</hi><lb/>
since I was much occupied with my<lb/>
duties at Hdqrs <add>16</add> <unclear>orphan asylurus etc</unclear>-<lb/>
As regards Lazear he came to Cuba be-<lb/>
<unclear>four</unclear> Reed but because he had been<lb/>
recommended by Prof. Welch to Reed<lb/>
for the yellow fever work- This was<lb/>
the way I understood it- The Board<lb/>
was created by S. O. 122 A. Y.O. Par. 34 - May 24,<lb/>
1900 but as Lazear came to Cuba in Feb 1900<lb/>
the board must have new planned or in contem-<lb/>
plation some months before its creation for<lb/>
this to have been the case- It may be of<lb/>
course that Prof. Welch's recommendation may<lb/>
have been given <hi>after</hi> Lazear had come to<lb/>
Cuba- Dr. Hench spent most of the day<lb/>
June 17 with me- I was much impressed<lb/>
with his zeal and earnestness- No amount<lb/>
of trouble is too great to get the bottom facts<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06284032"/>
<unclear>2</unclear><lb/>
5<lb/>
Did he write you that he found the Cubans<lb/>
had bought the piece of land below the rail-<lb/>
road to Playa where our little yellow fever hospital<lb/>
was located, and had put up a sign there<lb/>
under the impression that it was the location<lb/>
of Camp Lazear! He finally got hold of the<lb/>
sister of the man who owned the land where<lb/>
Camp Lazear really was &amp; took her out<lb/>
there &amp; had her identify the real place.<lb/>
Her brother had died some time ago-<lb/>
Moran helped too in this identification-<lb/>
He took photographs of everything- I think<lb/>
we should help him all we can-</p>
<p>I am delighted that you are going to<lb/>
print your recollection of this famous<lb/>
episode- Gen. Ireland asked what<lb/>
were the statements of Agramonte's that<lb/>
you reproaced us for indorsing and<lb/>
I could not remember what you were<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06284033"/>
5<lb/>
* see <unclear>P.55</unclear><lb/>
referring to. His statement about the<lb/>
putting of the infected mosquito on<lb/>
X. Y. (<unclear>W<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></unclear> H. Dean, 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <unclear>Cav.</unclear>) always seemed<lb/>
to me to have been rather unlikely,<lb/>
but I had no facts at my command<lb/>
to disprove it and so never said any-<lb/>
thing about it- One's memory plays<lb/>
queer tricks with even the best of <unclear>men</unclear><lb/>
at times - Dr. Pinto who I have always<lb/>
regarded as a five fellow made some<lb/>
surprising statements about his con-<lb/>
nection with the Reed Board but I<lb/>
did not see any use in disputing<lb/>
them and have no doubt he was<lb/>
perfectly sincere &amp; honest in his<lb/>
belief as to his accuracy- Well I must<lb/>
stop- Be sure to finish your memoir<lb/>
and to let me have a copy before<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06284034"/>
C2<lb/>
<lb/>B5<lb/>
<hi>6</hi><lb/>
I shuffle off- I was 80 in June<lb/>
and am getting quite infirm-<lb/>
cracking up is Ireland's favorite<lb/>
expression- He dont use it about<lb/>
me now because it is too obviously<lb/>
true- He is the dearest friend in<lb/>
the world and spends his time<lb/>
helping his friends-</p>
<p>This account. of X. Y. was <hi>not</hi><lb/>
that in his sworn statement<lb/>
but in an article-</p>
<p>*-</p>
<p>P. S. Before closing my letter I read<lb/>
over your pen-letter again and real-<lb/>
ized that Senate Doc. 822 was my compila-<lb/>
tion published by Senator Owen which<lb/>
I keep always at hand bound in<lb/>
half morocco and never lend to anyone-<lb/>
So I have turned to page 25 and read<lb/>
Agramonte's statement of what he did.<lb/>
It seems now that it was not true that<lb/>
&ldquo;the best <del>in</del> friendship existed between all<lb/>
the members of the board&rdquo; but I did not<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06284035"/>
<hi>7</hi>-<lb/>
know as much then as I do not<lb/>
especially about Carroll- It<lb/>
was Carroll that told me that<lb/>
Agramonte was immune and so<lb/>
did not deserve the same credit<lb/>
as the other members of the board<unclear>.</unclear><lb/>
Agramonte afterwards told me that<lb/>
he left Cuba as a small child<lb/>
and he did not know whether<lb/>
he was immune or not-</p>
<p>Dr. Roger Post Ames claimed to be<lb/>
an immune &amp; was appointed<lb/>
by Reed to look after the experi-<lb/>
mental cases on that account-<lb/>
Did you know that later he took<lb/>
to his bed in the Columbia Hospital<lb/>
diagnosed his own case as yellow<lb/>
fever at least I suppose he did - and<lb/>
was discharged after 4 or 5 days with<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06284036"/>
C2<lb/>

<hi>8</hi><lb/>
a diagnosis of yellow fever!<lb/>
And now for some years his widow<lb/>
who is good looking and a Texas poli-<lb/>
tician, very near to Senator Shepherd<lb/>
Chairman of the Senate Military Com-<lb/>
mittee - has been trying to get his<lb/>
name added to the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Roll of Honor, so that she can have<lb/>
the pension of $100. a month and<lb/>
her boys have the gold medal-</p>
<p>I think her claim has passed the<lb/>
Senate she has at any rate a favor-<lb/>
able Report from the committee-<lb/>
Did you know that Dr. Ames did some<lb/>
experimenting on his own hook at Fort<lb/>
M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Intosh Texas <add>in 1903</add>- He infected some mosqui-<lb/>
toes &amp; put them on a young soldier David<lb/>
D. Driscoll Co. F. 26. <unclear>Inf.</unclear> who had a very<lb/>
severe case &amp; had to be discharged-</p>

<p>So Driscoll applied to be put on<lb/>

<p>Well I must stop gossiping-<lb/>
Poor Col. Ashburn is slowly dying<lb/>
of a very painful cancer of the<lb/>

Mrs Ashburn over the phone-</p>
