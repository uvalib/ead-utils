The Director of Public Health,<lb/>
The Ministerio de Fomento,<lb/>
Lima, Peru.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sirs:</salute>
</opener>
<p>There seems to have been considerable confusion about the<lb/>
delivery of the Noguchi Vaccine which was ordered to this Department<lb/>
by the International Health Board, and I would like to obtain certain<lb/>
information in regard to this matter.</p>
<p>It was first understood here that the vaccine would be sent to<lb/>
the Banco Mercantil Americano, and Mr. Bonzi had made all arrangements<lb/>
to receive the vaccine and take care of it according to the instructions<lb/>
from the International Health Board. For some unknown reason the directions<lb/>
for the delivery of the vaccine were changed, and as a consequence no one<lb/>
was on hand at the time to receive the vaccine when the ship was in port.<lb/>
The vaccine therefore went on to Pacasmayo, where it was taken ashore<lb/>
and later transported overland by way of Cayalti to this place. For a<lb/>
product which should be kept constantly on ice this is not the proper way<lb/>
to handle it. It is necessary that I know more about this matter so as to<lb/>
enable me to fix the responsibility in this matter. Please write full details.</p>
<p>Furthermore according to the correspondence which I saw in Lima<lb/>
there ought to be more vaccine on hand there. The vaccine which was turned over<lb/>
to me consisted only of three 20cc bottles of vaccine and four bottles of ser-<lb/>
um. <hi>Is there no other stock of this vaccine on hand in Lima?</hi></p>
<p>In the future I believe it will be better to all materials of this<lb/>
kind directed to the Central Office with previous notification, and we will<lb/>
arrange to send some responsible party aboard to receive it personally.</p>

<salute>Respectfully yours,</salute>
