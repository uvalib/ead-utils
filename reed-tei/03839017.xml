Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>
Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you for returning the rest of the material on yellow fever,<lb/>
and also for sending the two reprints of your article, &ldquo;Conquerors of<lb/>
Yellow Fever.&rdquo; I have passed one copy on to Dr. Sigerist as you requested.</p>
<p>You did call attention in an earlier letter to the fact that<lb/>
some of the letters mentioned are missing from the Peabody material you had.<lb/>
When Dr. Peabody left the package of material here, the staff member with<lb/>
whom he left it understood that he was giving it to us merely for safe-<lb/>
keeping and would return for it after a short time, so that it had nover<lb/>
been opened, so far as we know, until I looked into it preparatory to sending<lb/>
it to you. So it is hardly likely that the letters were lost here.</p>
<p>I am sorry I do not know whether the clippings were from the<lb/>
Baltimore Sun or the New York Sun. As the package had not been opened,<lb/>
no one here knew of its contents, and only one employee <unclear>knew</unclear> of the presence<lb/>
of it in the library. Since you returned the material we have had cards<lb/>
placed in the catalog indicating what and where it is, so that it will be<lb/>
available to those interested.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the photographs which Dr. Kelly gave the Johns<lb/>
Hopkins Hospital many years ago, and which came to this library when this<lb/>
building was completed in 1929, have never been completely cataloged. I<lb/>
have looked through them as well as I can in their present state, but have<lb/>
found nothing else bearing on the yellow fever experiments except a photo-<lb/>
graph of John R. Kissinger with the following memorandum, initialed by Dr.<lb/>
Kelly, on the back: &ldquo;Photo of John R. Kissinger, sent Feb. 25, 1912, quite<lb/>
surely a reprod. from an older photo. Brought me by Dr. C. W. Latimer<lb/>
8 Mch. 1912. H.A.K.&rdquo; The photograph of Camp Lazear opposite page 146 in<lb/>
the 1906 edition of Dr. Kelly's book, <hi>Walter Reed and Yellow Fever</hi>, is<lb/>
identical with one in the material we sent you from Dr. Kelly's collection,<lb/>
but I have not been able to find any others. I believe it is possible, how-<lb/>
ever, to have copies made from illustrations in the book. This Kelly collection<lb/>
of photographs is to be cataloged during this academic year, we hope, and if<lb/>
anything comes to light that will interest you I shall be glad to send it on.<lb/>
The partial catalog which we have does not reveal anything other than the<lb/>
items you have already seen.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your own contributions to our material on<lb/>
this subject.</p>
