Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>

<salute>Dear Doctor:</salute>
</opener>
<p>My warmest thanks for the excellent photostatic<lb/>
copies you have made of my father's papers. A very good<lb/>
job; <del>and,</del> as a matter of fact, many of them are far more<lb/>
legible in the copy you have made than they were in the<lb/>
original. I am indeed very glad to have them.</p>
<p>Of the different methods <unclear>if</unclear> you suggest for re-<lb/>
turning the original data I believe the best route will be<lb/>
Dr. Nogueira, if he is willing to take the trouble. I don't<lb/>
know him personally but he has made a very good reputation<lb/>
for himself, and I consider him incapable of tampering with<lb/>
scientific materials of any kind. Nevertheless, to avoid<lb/>
possible use of these facts, in a way that would <add>be</add> untrue<lb/>
or biased (I think the time is not yet ripe for cool appre-<lb/>
ciation of the relative values by my fellow countrymen) it<lb/>
would be indeed advisable to have the package <hi>sealed</hi> as you<lb/>
suggested. Wouldn't that make some trouble for Nogueira <del><unclear></unclear></del> with<lb/>
the U.S. or Cuban customs officials? I am planning to see or<lb/>
speak to him over the telephone in the next few days, and I<lb/>
shall get his consent before he leaves Havana. As soon as I<lb/>
do, I shall follow this up with a note to let you know what<lb/>
he says about it. Otherwise, registered air mail, seems safe<lb/>
enough at present, though of course terribly expensive.</p>
<p>You need not thank me for lending you the papers.<lb/>
They are in good hands, and if you eventually see that the<lb/>
official Army records are completed and that the files per-<lb/>
taining to my father are duely corrected I shall feel amply<lb/>
rewarded for any help I may have given you in clearing up<lb/>
some of the dark spots of the experiments. Also that the facts<lb/>
be brought to the attention of Generals Kean, Truby and Reed.</p>
<p>As to the letter from my father to Hemmeter, I have<lb/>
gone through those papers that I had with me the day of your<lb/>
visit. As far as I can see, the only letter of which I have<lb/>
a copy is - as you thought - dated February 2, 1913. It seems<lb/>
to me that Hemmeter's reply actually answers this letter, line<lb/>
by line. There must be some mistake in <unclear>quoting</unclear> the dates. If you<lb/>
want a copy of that I can send it to you. When I check the prin-<lb/>
ted <unclear>matter</unclear> I gave you, to see if I have reprints so you can<lb/>
keep the copies <del>xx</del> you now have, I shall search again, but<lb/>
I believe the contents of the letters make sense as they are,<lb/>
though the dates do not agree.</p>

HERMINIO PORTEL VIL&Aacute;</p>
<p>My congratulations of the success of your campaign<lb/>
for the preservation of the remains of Camp Lazear. I hadn't<lb/>
heard of it. I am afraid some ill feeling has been aroused<lb/>
lately among the Finlay-fanatics by the fact that President<lb/>
Truman, in his speech at the celebration of the 50th. anniver-<lb/>
sary of the Joint Resolution, mentioned Reed, Gorgas and my<lb/>
father and left out Finlay entirely. Of course he referred to<lb/>
the cooperation between Americans and Cubans, but it was imme<del>diat</del><lb/>
diately picked up here and taken as a deliberate slight to<lb/>
Dr. Finlay.</p>
<p>I would give a great deal to hear your &ldquo;oration&rdquo; at<lb/>
the International Congress on Tropical Medicine. Please let<lb/>
me at least read a copy of both that and your speech at the<lb/>
unveiling of Reed's bust. My father always admired Dr. Reed<lb/>
inmensely, and all the petty jealousies and envy of Carroll<lb/>
never made him change his regard for him. Re-reading the<lb/>
handwritten letter you <del><unclear></unclear></del> copied I find considerable<lb/>
warmth in his words and the dignified southern courtesy I<lb/>
often heard my father <unclear>comment on</unclear>. I don't think there can<lb/>
be any doubt as to my father being &ldquo;in&rdquo; on the experiments,<lb/>
after seeing the personal letters, <del>where</del><add><unclear>for which</unclear></add> Dr. Reed gradually<lb/>
makes him responsab<del>i</del>le for most of the preliminary arrange-<lb/>
ments, even before the Y.F. Commission began working together.</p>
<p>Please remember to send me clippings or copies of<lb/>
your speeches at the Washington Congress. In the next few days<lb/>
I shall get in touch with Dr. Nogueira and will let you know<lb/>
how things stand. There is another plan also: a very intimate<lb/>
friend of my family is coming down in June to visit me (for<lb/>
several months) She is a retired nurse and lives at present<lb/>
in <unclear>Pleasa<add>n</add>tville</unclear>, N.Y. I don't know how far that is from the<lb/>
city but it might be possible for her to contact you during<lb/>
your visit to New York in the latter part of May. Well we can<lb/>
arrange for this in case Dr. N. proves difficult to count upon.</p>
<p>Again my thanks for the fine copies. and my best<lb/>
regards to your charming wife.</p>

<salute>Most cordially,</salute>
