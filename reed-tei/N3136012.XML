<p>Move Afoot<lb/>
To Buy Small<lb/>
Virginia House<lb/>
Where Yellow<lb/>
Fever Hero<lb/>
Was A Baby</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>By ALLYN B. TUNIS.</p>
<p>BACK a little way from the cross-<lb/>
roads at Belroi, a modest postoffice<lb/>
in Gloucester county, Virginia, not far<lb/>
from the York river, is a tiny weather-<lb/>
beaten building. It is without paint,<lb/>
minus doors and shows every mark of<lb/>
dilapidated abandonment.</p>
<p>It has been there for nearly one hun-<lb/>
dred years, undistinguished by any<lb/>
mark to call attention to the fact that<lb/>
here was born the man who wiped out<lb/>
yellow fever and showed public health<lb/>
surgeons how to control typhoid and<lb/>
other deadly epidemic diseases.</p>
<p>Without the discoveries of Walter<lb/>
Reed, it would have been impossible to<lb/>
build the Panama Canal; otherwise the<lb/>
Canal Zone would not have been habit-<lb/>
able for the Americans who created that<lb/>
important waterway.</p>
<p>HOSPITAL BEARS NAME.</p>
<p>America did not completely recognize<lb/>
Walter Reed at first. After his death<lb/>
the Walter Reed Hospital, at Washing-<lb/>
ton, was erected as a memorial to him.<lb/>
In Newport News, Va., a public school<lb/>
bears his name and contains this tab-<lb/>
let: &ldquo;To the Memory of Walter C.<lb/>
Reed, Major, Medical Corps, U. S.<lb/>
Army. Born Gloucester County, Vir-<lb/>
ginia, 1846. Died Washington, D. C.,<lb/>
1902. Scientist, Humanitarian and<lb/>
Discoverer of the Cause and Prevention<lb/>
of Serious Epidemic Diseases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For years the little house in Virginia<lb/>
has been unrecognized. There has been<lb/>
a widespread opinion that Walter Reed<lb/>
was born at Harrisonburg, Rockingham</p>
<p><figure entity="N3136012"></figure> The birthplace of Walter Reed, at Belroi, Va., which may be<lb/>
made into a national shrine if present plans are carried out.</p>
<p>county, Va. This error probably was<lb/>
due to the fact that Walter Reed's<lb/>
father, who was a Methodist minister,<lb/>
moved his family from Gloucester to<lb/>
Harrisonburg to take another pastorate,<lb/>
although Dr. John C. Reed, a brother,<lb/>
asserts that Walter Reed never lived in<lb/>
Harrisonburg.</p>
<p>Apparently there is no doubt of the<lb/>
authenticity of the house at Belroi being<lb/>
Walter Reed's birthplace. Eighty years<lb/>
after his birth, the shabby house is about<lb/>
to be repaired and preserved as a na-<lb/>
tional shrine.</p>
<p>DEFINITE ACTION TAKEN.</p>
<p>There have been movements from<lb/>
time to time and by various organiza-<lb/>
tions to take over the property, but only<lb/>
last month, when the danger of the<lb/>
frail building falling into irreparable<lb/>
decay was detected, was definite action<lb/>
taken.</p>
<p>It was decided by the Medical Society<lb/>
of Virginia, through a committee headed<lb/>
by Dr. Clarence Porter Jones, of New-<lb/>
port News, to take over the property<lb/>
and protect it against obliteration and<lb/>
possible destruction by fire. It was<lb/>
owned by the storekeeper and post-<lb/>
master at Belroi, George D. Stubbs, who<lb/>
executed a deed conveying the house<lb/>
and less than an acre of land on which<lb/>
it stands to the society.</p>
<p>WAS PLANTATION THEN.</p>
<p>A movement now is on foot to induce<lb/>
the State Board of Education to per-<lb/>
mit Virginia school children to give to<lb/>
a fund which will be used to convert<lb/>
the property into a national memorial.</p>
<p>Before the Civil War Beroi was not a<lb/>
village and had not reached the im-<lb/>
portance of being a postoffice. It was a<lb/>
plantation, called Belle-Roy, named in<lb/>
honor of its mistress and master.</p>
<p>Across the road from the manor house<lb/>
stood the Gloucester county Methodist<lb/>
parsonage. When the Rev. Mr. Reed<lb/>
and his family came to this charge his<lb/>
family temporarily was domiciled in the<lb/>
overseer's house at Belle-Roy, the par-<lb/>
sonage undergoing repairs at the time.<lb/>
The overseer's house boatsed only a<lb/>
story and a half. The one-room section<lb/>
was added about forty years ago.</p>
<p>In 1898, when the Spanish-American<lb/>
War broke out, Captain Reed was ap-<lb/>
pointed head of a board to study typhoid<lb/>
fever epidemics, which fast were killing<lb/>
American soldiers in Southern camps.</p>
<p>Captain Reed was selected to lead a<lb/>
board in Cuba to study yellow fever.<lb/>
For years ravages of this disease had<lb/>
been severe on the island. There had<lb/>
been outbreaks in many parts of the<lb/>
United States; epidemics in the South.<lb/>
It was regarded as a constant menace in<lb/>
the South. Prevention and remedies<lb/>
were unknown.</p>
<p>PROVED HIS CASE.</p>
<p>To support Captain Reed's theory<lb/>
about yellow fever, it was necessary<lb/>
that men volunteer to submit themselves<lb/>
to mosquito bites. Experiments es-<lb/>
tablished the fact that yellow fever is<lb/>
transmitted by mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed proved that the mosquito is<lb/>
the only means of transmitting the<lb/>
dread disease.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed was recognized as one of<lb/>
the world's greatest discoverers in the<lb/>
field of preventive medicine, although<lb/>
he did not live to reap the full measure<lb/>
of the honors heaped upon his name at<lb/>
home and abroad.</p>
<p>At his birthplace the little piece of<lb/>
ground will be made into a park and<lb/>
the spot easily can be reached by motor-<lb/>
ists, as it is just a few miles off the<lb/>
Tidewater Virginia Trail.</p>
<p>The Medical Society of Virginia is at<lb/>
work on plans to raise $100,000 to es-<lb/>
tablish a Walter Reed memorial chair<lb/>
of medical research at the University of<lb/>
Virginia.</p>
