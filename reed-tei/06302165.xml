Mr. George I. H. Carroll<lb/>
2814 Rhode Island Ave., N. E.<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Carroll:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I thought you would be interested in having a few photographs of<lb/>
the remains of Camp Lazear in Havana. I took them either last year or this<lb/>
April when I went to visit Havana again. I believe I told you over the<lb/>
phone when I talked with you early last month that I had been fortunate<lb/>
enough to &ldquo;rediscover&rdquo; the lost Camp Lazear. You will find on the back<lb/>
comments identifying the photographs. I am sure you will be interested to<lb/>
see the present condition of Camp Lazear especially the present state of the<lb/>
famous little &ldquo;Building Number One&rdquo; which is still in existence and which<lb/>
is where your father and Walter Reed and the others accomplished their won-<lb/>
derful work. I am hoping to arrange to have the site of Camp Lazear and<lb/>
the little building properly preserved as a memorial to last for all time<lb/>
to the memory of your father and his colleagues.</p>
<p>As I told you in my letter of May 23, the Wyeth Company, an old<lb/>
and reputable American pharmaceutical house, commissioned Mr. Dean Cornwell,<lb/>
a famous American painter, to do a large painting, entitled &ldquo;Conquerors of<lb/>
Yellow Fever&rdquo;. This painting was unveiled in Cleveland June 2, during the<lb/>
convention of the American Medical Association. The unveiling was made by<lb/>
Walter Reed's daughter, Miss Blossom Reed. Mr. Kissinger was there, also<lb/>
the mayor of Cleveland, the President and President-elect of the American<lb/>
Medical Association, representatives from various medical schools and art<lb/>
museums and a few people from Washington, among them Colonel Siler and<lb/>
General and Mrs. Ireland. It was really a very nice affair and the paint-<lb/>
ing was very well received. I am sorry you could not be there. (As I<lb/>
wrote you I don't think the Wyeth people had your address, hence they may<lb/>
not have known where to send you an invitation.)</p>
<p>He never<lb/>
answered<lb/>
this letter<lb/>
but I'll keep<lb/>
on!</p>
<p>But in time you shall see copies of the painting and I am sure<lb/>
you will like to have one. The central action of the painting shows Dr.<lb/>
Lazear inoculating your father. Grouped behind and on either side are<lb/>
others involved--Reed, Finlay, Agramonte, Gen. Wood, and a group of soldier<lb/>
volunteers. Altogether it is a very stimulating and historical scene.</p>
<p>I had the honor of being asked to make some remarks at the un-<lb/>
veiling and I am taking the liberty of sending you a copy of my talk. I<lb/>
do hope you accept it in the spirit I send it--as a very earnest tribute<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06302166"/>
Mr. George I. H. Carroll<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>
July 11, 1941<lb/>
to a very gallant group of men. If my tribute to your father seems brief<lb/>
it is chiefly because, unfortunately it is difficult to find in the official<lb/>
records as much about your father's actions and work as that about certain<lb/>
others.</p>
<p>Would you permit me to send your address to the Wyeth folks so<lb/>
they can send you a colored reproduction of the painting when they are<lb/>
available in a few weeks?</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely,</salute>
