<salute>My dear Dr Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your special delivery letter of May<lb/>
2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> arrived the next morning and was read<lb/>
with much interest, and admiration<lb/>
of your energy and zeal. I will try<lb/>
to have every thing ready for you<lb/>
on Thursday afternoon when you<lb/>
arrive. Mrs Franck from the Mil-<lb/>
Surgeon's Office can come and will<lb/>
be here - a sensible middle aged<lb/>
woman not very quick as a Stenog,<lb/>
but reliable, and will be satis-<lb/>
factory. I much prefer to finish<lb/>
up Thursday evening and if I<lb/>
am well will enjoy it. Will plan<lb/>
for you to take dinner here, and<lb/>

AC<lb/>
K<lb/>

Mrs. Franck also, so we can keep<lb/>
right on. My house-boy goes to<lb/>
hospital that day but we will<lb/>
not starve. I hope you will be<lb/>
able to meet Gen. Ireland while<lb/>
you are here. We can get the<lb/>
address of Mrs. Roger Post Ames<lb/>
from Senator Shephards Office.<lb/>
One of Dr Carroll's sons is here<lb/>
in the Treasury. Gen. Ireland<lb/>
has been on his trail &amp; can tell<lb/>
us how to find him.<lb/>
I dont think that Mrs. Ames will<lb/>
have any thing of interest. She has<lb/>
been trying to get Ames' name put<lb/>
on the Y. F. Roll of Honor, so she will<lb/>
get a pension and has prepared a<lb/>
very clever case in legal style. Convin-<lb/>
cing to those who do not know the<lb/>
inside facts. Sen. Shephard, who<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06302104"/>
3<lb/>
died recently, was Chairman of the<lb/>
Senate Military Committee and<lb/>
I think got a favorable report<lb/>
from it but did not win over<lb/>
the House mil. Comt<hi rend="superscript">ee</hi></p>
<p>I have not talked with Gen Ireland<lb/>
about a memorial at Camp Lazear<lb/>
Perhaps you will have a chance.<lb/>
Suppose I get him to take lunch<lb/>
with us at the Army &amp; Navy Club<lb/>
on Friday, and you can got to the<lb/>
Signal Corps and Q. M. Gen's Office<lb/>
after lunch. I dont think you can<lb/>
get get any thing there to pay for the<lb/>
effort however. The plans of those<lb/>
shacks at Camp Lazear were too<lb/>
informal to be preserved all these<lb/>
years and being built with Cuban<lb/>
funds would not come to Washington<lb/>
unless in some medical document.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f06302105"/>

<p>A more urgent question than the<lb/>
location of that stovepipe hole is<lb/>
where you will find a room on the<lb/>
night of Thursday 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, as the hotels<lb/>
in Wash. have been crowded to the<lb/>
doors since before Easter and they<lb/>
ceased to answer letters of inquiry.<lb/>
So I would be surprised if you have<lb/>
any success in your request to the<lb/>
Mayflower. The Army &amp; Navy Club<lb/>
which usually can find a room for<lb/>
guests with cards sent out a circular<lb/>
that for the present they would<lb/>
restrict the rooms to members who<lb/>
were non-resident. But on talking<lb/>
to the office I was told that if on<lb/>
Tuesday morning there was a<lb/>
room to spare I could get it<lb/>
for you, and in any event they<lb/>
have an arrangement with near-<lb/>
by hotels by which they could secure<lb/>

WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
a room. So if you do not get ac-<lb/>
commodation at the Mayflower send<lb/>
me a wire and I will take it up<lb/>
with the Club Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Since writing the above I<lb/>
have gotten in touch with General<lb/>
Ireland who has been away for<lb/>
a week. He will get in touch with<lb/>
young Carroll and will make inqui-<lb/>
ries about the Gen. Staff map collec-<lb/>
tion. I have been greatly interested<lb/>
in the Hemmeter articles and letters<lb/>
that you <del>would</del> had mimeographed-<lb/>
and have made notes on the margin<lb/>
as you requested.</p>
<p>Au revoir until Thursday</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours</salute>
