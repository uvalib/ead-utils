<salute>My Dearest Daughter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I left <unclear>Marion</unclear> Wednesday mor-<lb/>
ning at 5.25 A. M. &amp; <del>g</del>reached Camden that<lb/>
afternoon. It was raining &amp; had been<lb/>
raining all the week. There was one<lb/>
<del>visit</del> place that it was desireable to visit -<lb/>
very desireable - but it was practically im-<lb/>
possible to reach- It was about 15 miles<lb/>
from Camden - but the road was reported as<lb/>
impossible. It is 7 miles from this place-<lb/>
Wateree - but across the river. I went<lb/>
there last year - by launch - but that is<lb/>
now out of commission. It was proposed<lb/>
to go around about way by Auto, - but<lb/>
this involved a ride of 67 miles <hi>each</hi><lb/>
way - &amp; I would not undertake it.</p>
<p>It was agreed that I would let it go &amp; re-<lb/>
turn to Washington<unclear>.</unclear> &amp; come back <unclear>soon</unclear> to<lb/>
be at Camden next <del>Wednesday</del><add><del>or Th</del> Tuesday night</add>- This<lb/>
would give <unclear>me.</unclear> Friday to Monday <unclear>inclusive</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00934028"/>
2<lb/>
<unclear>i e.</unclear> 2 1/2 working days, &amp; I got ready to go. off<lb/>
Thursday morning!- Saturday is a 1/2 day at the<lb/>
Library - <hi>9-12</hi>.</p>
<p>Thinking over it I changed my mind, &amp; came<lb/>
here instead - to await a possible change<lb/>
of weather. It has not come <add>until today &amp; this is too late</add>.- However I<lb/>
<del>a</del> find that I can get to within <hi>13</hi> miles of my<lb/>
destination by <hi>rail</hi> &amp; a machine will<lb/>
meet me there &amp; I will do this Tuesday<lb/>
&amp; get to Camden Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>I stayed on my own <del>mottion</del> motion - so am<lb/>
only going to charge what I would have done<lb/>
had I returned to Washington- I will get<lb/>
<del>however</del> $350. on this trip however &amp; if the<lb/>
case lasts over Wednesday- I think it will last<lb/>
into Thursday - $50.00 more.</p>
<p>I was hurt - <hi>Kink</hi> - by a long automobile<lb/>
ride I took at Marion <del>&amp; was quite sick.</del><add>on Tuesday <unclear>&amp;</unclear> was</add><lb/>
feeling quite badly - from Friday night to<lb/>
Saturday night - 24 hours about, It seems<lb/>
to <add>be</add> over now - but <del>I</del> it was on this account<lb/>
that I declined the long ride, It was a mis-<lb/>
understanding at Marion- We went down<lb/>
My hip is doing very well - as well as, or better<lb/>
than, it was in Washington.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00934029"/>
3<lb/>
by boat - about 30 miles - took a short - <unclear>10</unclear> mile-<lb/>
Auto trip &amp; the boat was to have met us but<lb/>
did not. I explained that I was willing<lb/>
to make the <del>August</del><add>September</add> survey - about 3 days<lb/>
maybe 4- by boat but that I would not<lb/>
take any more long land trips. The same<lb/>
<unclear>here</unclear>. They want me in September, - but I<lb/>
doubt if I will, attend - not unless they get<lb/>
another boat.</p>
<p>I have written my answer to Wickliffe<lb/>
Rose's letter &amp; it was rather a job. I <del>take</del><add>took</add><lb/>
practically all Friday to get it done &amp;<lb/>
yesterday afternoon to finish it. How-<lb/>
ever<del>, I will b</del> it is done, &amp; I will have it ty-<lb/>
ped when I get a chance. It would have<lb/>
taken a day, of the 2 1/2 days, <del>in</del> had I gone<lb/>
on to Washington</p>
<p>When I go back my plan is to go by<lb/>
the Southern to <hi>Amherst</hi>. Change there<lb/>
to the local train for New Glasgow. Don't<lb/>
exactly know how the trains <del>nun</del> run<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00934030"/>
4<lb/>
but last year the through train got to<lb/>
Amherst &amp; <hi>stopped</hi> there about 5 P. M. &amp; the<lb/>
local came by early next morning - the<lb/>
same I got from Lynchburg. At any rate I<lb/>
can make Lynchburg &amp; take the local<lb/>
from that place - only one has to go about<lb/>
4 miles across town &amp; it is nuisance<lb/>
&amp; then an auto to the station next morning.</p>
<p>I rec'd your letter written <del>an</del><add>on</add> the train &amp;<lb/>
I judge that I will get another one Tues-<lb/>
day - at Camden, I wrote you from Marion,<lb/>
a short letter. Have written to Fannie<lb/>
Claiborne to forward my <hi>letter</hi> mail to<lb/>
Charlotte - Care Southern Power Co &amp; when<lb/>
I get to Camden will advise <unclear>be</unclear> to hold<lb/>
it. I think your next letter had best be<lb/>
addressed to me at New Glasgow, - but if<lb/>
there be any <hi>emergency</hi> - to Camden<lb/>
Care <hi>Mr de Loach</hi> - Att. at Law, I expect<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00934031"/>
5<lb/>
to leave Camden <unclear>Thurday</unclear> evening - but<lb/>
may do so- Thursday morning: or even possi-<lb/>
bly Wednesday <del>morning</del><add>night</add>. The trial on the other<lb/>
hand <hi>may</hi> hold me into Friday- I think not,<lb/>
however</p>
<p>How is Henry &amp; how is he doing? If<lb/>
<del><unclear>he</unclear></del> has to raise money from his Capital<lb/>
I judge he can do so most advantageous-<lb/>
ly from his Liberty bonds- They are at<lb/>
<unclear>par. yeild</unclear> 4 1/4% &amp; I presume he does not<lb/>
have to pay much income tax - at least<lb/>
no excess tax - I wish he had. I will<lb/>
make enough on this trip &amp; what I have a-<lb/>
greed to do at Marion - i.e., go at least as a<lb/>
witness - to cover the $400. I must re-<lb/>
turn to Hayne in the fall. Hope I will<lb/>
have <unclear>$100. over</unclear> to cover our extra tax on<lb/>
intangibles laid on this year.</p>
<p>I am rather anxious to get back to Va. <unclear>To rest</unclear><lb/>
a while- I am resting now by the way &amp;<lb/>
wish I had <unclear>sent</unclear> for the S. E. Post &amp; Cosmopolitan<lb/>
yesterday. Then to get at my History: &amp; to be rea-<lb/>
dy to meet Hanson, in New York<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00934032"/>
6<lb/>
I don't think he will possibly be in until a-<lb/>
bout <del>to</del><add>the <unclear>&amp; &amp;</unclear></add> 12-15 of August, Walcott will proba-<lb/>
bly want to see me - if he comes about that time</p>
<p>I<del>n</del> wrote to Rose from Washington: <del>Ackn</del><lb/>
Acknowledging the receipt of his letter of July<lb/>
12 - &amp; telling him I would answer as soon as<lb/>
I could. <del>g</del> I gave him the <hi>S. P. Co-</hi> as my tem-<lb/>
porary address - &amp; will give New Glasgow<lb/>
when I leave for that place.</p>
<p>I could have utilized the 2 1/2 days in<lb/>
Washington to great advantage at the<lb/>
<unclear>S. G' l's</unclear> library- I want to finish Chis-<lb/>
holm's book - about a day - &amp; read Pym's &amp;<lb/>
<unclear>Andanard's.-</unclear> I have Chisholm <unclear>wrong</unclear>. He<lb/>
counted the <unclear>Bulam</unclear> fever as made <unclear>de no-<lb/>
vo</unclear> - <hi>not</hi> out of malaria - aboard <unclear>ship.</unclear> Under<lb/>
ordinary conditions- Typhus would have<lb/>
been produced; under tropical <unclear>ones-</unclear> this<lb/>
&ldquo;nova peste&rdquo; resulted - <hi>very like Typhus</hi><lb/>
not at all like the y. f. of the West Indies<lb/>
which was &ldquo;frankly <unclear>paludal</unclear>&rdquo; <unclear>&amp;</unclear> &ldquo;<hi>never</hi> <unclear>con-</unclear><lb/>

7<lb/>

with y. f. <unclear>however</unclear> - which <del>now became</del><add>was</add> com-<lb/>
municable. That is the y. f. of the West Indies<lb/>
- by which he meant malarial fever - had<lb/>
never been contagious. This <hi>new</hi> fever - gen-<lb/>
erated, by <del><unclear>crowlding</unclear></del> crowding &amp; lack of ven-<lb/>
tilation aboard <unclear>the.</unclear> Hankey - conditions <unclear>w'h</unclear> in<lb/>
cold climates generated Typhhus - was frankly<lb/>
contagious. &amp; after being a year in the Little<lb/>
Antilles - &ldquo;took on <del>the off</del> much of the as-<lb/>
pect of y. f.&rdquo; but was transmissible. <del><unclear>ii</unclear></del><lb/>
Evidently there was no y. f. in the Antilles<lb/>
at the time, <del>&amp; it was</del> what was <del>so</del> called, y. f<lb/>
was malaria<unclear>:</unclear> &amp; y. f. was reintroduced<lb/>
from Africa! It is very interesting<lb/>
especially the point of view - of an educa-<lb/>
ted close observer who had not the key to<lb/>
<hi>the</hi> problem: I did not finish the book<lb/>
&amp; must do so.</p>
<p>It has not been hot here &amp;, as you know, I<lb/>
have been doing nothing since last Tues-<lb/>
day<unclear>-:</unclear> so - except for the time my kink was.<lb/>
bothering me<lb/>
