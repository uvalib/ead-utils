<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>On receiving your letter I checked with<lb/>
Mr. Brewer on the various questions raised.</p>
<p>So far as we can discover, there was no<lb/>
picture taken of me presenting you with the degree.<lb/>
It is a shame we did not set that up and have it taken<lb/>
that day some time later than the exercises.</p>
<p>In regard to the photographs sent, I think<lb/>
Mr. Brewer has already written you. He understood<lb/>
your letter to say that you wanted one for yourself<lb/>
and each of the children, and thinking you had only<lb/>
two children he sent you three of each.</p>
<p>When he received my order to send five of<lb/>
each he was stymied because you said to not write the<lb/>
check for more than twenty-five dollars. He saw<lb/>
immediately that there were more photographs than you knew<lb/>
about and that five of each would greatly exceed your<lb/>
expected expenditure. Three of each cost you eighteen<lb/>
dollars and there are still more to come. I understand<lb/>
under these circumstances he has asked you to determine<lb/>
again whether you want two more of each one regardless<lb/>
of cost, or to place the order for what you do want.</p>
<p>We are all greatly concerned about the<lb/>
autographed portraits of Kissinger and Moran. I received<lb/>
your letter stating that you were sending them, but so<lb/>
far as any of us know they were never received. We had,<lb/>
meanwhile, sent to these men for pictures and Mr. Brewer<lb/>
received one from each man. These were the portraits which<lb/>
we used and which portraits were not autographed. We still<lb/>
have them but none of us have ever seen the portraits<lb/>
which you intended to send and which they had autographed.<lb/>
Mr. Brewer has the feeling that you sent them to a<lb/>
photographer to have copies made from them and that you<lb/>
probably did not get them back, but I do not recall his reason<lb/>
for thinking this. I am inclined to believe that you sent<lb/>
them to us but that they were lost in the mail. No one<lb/>
here has ever seen them so far as we can find out. We are<lb/>
greatly distressed about this and hope you do not lose<lb/>
them.</p>

<p>Harriet did receive &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo; but was not<lb/>
sure who had sent it and in the confusion failed to write.<lb/>
She is very appreciative of it and you will be hearing<lb/>
from her.</p>
<p>Everything is going along and I am hoping somehow<lb/>
to get away and visit Rochester in the middle of the<lb/>
winter. I will be conjuring up some proposed dates<lb/>
pretty soon and then I will check with you.</p>
<p>Our love to Mary and the children.</p>
