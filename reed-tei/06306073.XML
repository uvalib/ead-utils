<date value="1941-09-07">Sept. 7, 1941</date>

<salute>My dear Dr Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just received your<lb/>
Special Delivery Air mail letter<lb/>
of yesterday and I realize with<lb/>
regret that it was my negligence<lb/>
in not answering specifically and<lb/>
promptly your question about the<lb/>
family letters that Mrs. Blossom<lb/>
Reed loaned to you, that has<lb/>
caused the delay in sending the<lb/>
letter &amp; inclosures to Mrs. Laura Wood.<lb/>
She came to see me on Aug. 28 and<lb/>
as I had your letter of the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> inclos-<lb/>
ing the carbon copy of your letter<lb/>
to her we were both surprised<lb/>
that she had not gotten the original.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06306074"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
2<lb/>
I felt perfect confidence in your<lb/>
judgment is not giving her any of<lb/>
the <hi>contentious</hi> material, and,<lb/>
about the Reed letter, I do not<lb/>
know exactly what the Reed<lb/>
family has lent you and hesi-<lb/>
tated to express an opinion.<lb/>
So I have called up Gen W. L.<lb/>
Reed <add>just-now</add> and asked him about his<lb/>
sister and about your letting<lb/>
Miss Wood have copies of the<lb/>
letters of his father that his<lb/>
sister has let you see and use<lb/>
in your discretion. He said that<lb/>
he was quite willing to trust to<lb/>
your discretion as to their use<lb/>
but as the point was put up to<lb/>
him he did not know any thing<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06306075"/>

2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
about Miss Wood and he was inclin-<lb/>
ed not to do anything that might<lb/>
afterward distress his mother or<lb/>
his sister. I told him that I felt<lb/>
also there was no reason for our<lb/>
taking any chances and I recalled<lb/>
that his mother used to be a little<lb/>
sensitive about the &ldquo;love letters&rdquo; being<lb/>
published. So we agreed that<lb/>
it would be just as well not to<lb/>
give her any that had not been<lb/>
published already. Then he added<lb/>
&ldquo;I would hate to have her told that<lb/>
the family objected to her having<lb/>
them, couldn't you arrange it without<lb/>
that&rdquo;? I was a little amused at<lb/>
this but said &ldquo;certainly.&rdquo; So I will<lb/>
advise you that in my opinion as<lb/>
these letters belong to Blossom Reed<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06306076"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
4<lb/>
they should not been passed<lb/>
around to other hands without<lb/>
her permission. So you can tell<lb/>
Miss Wood that and if she<lb/>
comes to see me this week I<lb/>
will tell her that it was my<lb/>
oversight in failing to answer<lb/>
your question that caused the<lb/>
delay, and <add>will</add> give her that answer<lb/>
myself. Gen. Reed said that<lb/>
Blossom is getting on finely<lb/>
at Walter Reed and is out<lb/>
in the open air every day.<lb/>
He or his wife sees her every<lb/>
day but she is not allowed to<lb/>
see other visitors. I was amused<lb/>
at you having found Lawrence (Gen. R.)<lb/>
not a satisfactory correspondent.<lb/>
He has a reputation for not insur-<lb/>
ing letters and when he was made<lb/>

Inspector General. I phoned to his<lb/>
mother and gave her my felicita-<lb/>
tions and added, I was not going<lb/>
to write a note of congratulation to<lb/>
Lawrence because he had never<lb/>
answered an important letter<lb/>
that I had written him. Her reply<lb/>
was &ldquo;Oh you mustn't mind that<lb/>
in Lawrence he doesn't write to me<lb/>
either. He never writes a letter<lb/>
if he can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you see you need not expect<lb/>
to get any details out of Law-<lb/>
rence. I hope that you will<lb/>
take time to read the letter to the<lb/>
New York Times that I sent you<lb/>
and Dr. L. O. Howard's letter about<lb/>
it with his quotations from his<lb/>
letter from Major Reed. I want them<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06306078"/>

K<lb/>
6<lb/>
back but I am not in any hurry<lb/>
about it. You do not mention<lb/>
having received Truby's 165 page<lb/>
Sketch of the 4.7. Episode as I<lb/>
am sure he has not yet sent you<lb/>
a copy. Please let me know<lb/>
about this for you must see it<lb/>
at once. Gen. Ireland came over<lb/>
to get it as soon as I phoned<lb/>
him it had come and was<lb/>
immensely pleased with it.<lb/>
I must stop now and get this<lb/>
off but I cannot do so without<lb/>
thanking you for the very handsome<lb/>
thing that you said in your letter<lb/>
to Miss Laura Wood about the &ldquo;Trio<lb/>
Kean-Truby-Ireland&rdquo;. But you should<lb/>
put Ireland first. He is really<lb/>
a great as well as a very good man.</p>
