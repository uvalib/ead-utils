record, not warranting a finding of guilty of the charge,<lb/>
but rather sustaining the plea of not guilty by the accused.</p>
<p>If the court was cognizant of other facts in regard to the<lb/>
escape of the prisoners which would substantiate the find-<lb/>
ings and prove the culpability of the accused, the record<lb/>
