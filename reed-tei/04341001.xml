<salute>My dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Many thanks for your note of July 28th. I thought that I<lb/>
had written you some time ago concerning the erection of the memorial<lb/>
plaque at Fort Lesley McNair.</p>
<p>We finally arranged for its erection soon after you saw it and<lb/>
General Reed, General Love and I went down to see it the morning that<lb/>
Major Simpson completed the job. I had intended having photographs made<lb/>
prior to this time with the idea of having prints made for each member<lb/>
of the board. I was down there recently, however, and it seemed desir-<lb/>
able that the steps leading up to the building be filled in on each side<lb/>
and planted with grass. Major Simpson promised to do that and I decided<lb/>
to hold in abeyance the taking of the photograph until the grass grew up<lb/>
a bit. It is my intention to go down again soon and see how it looks now<lb/>
and if everything is proper I shall have a photograph made and will send<lb/>
you a copy of it in the near future.</p>
<p>We were sorry you could not be here for the funeral of Mrs. Reed<lb/>
but know that your life is an exceddingly busy one. We sent a wreath of<lb/>
flowers on behalf of the Memorial Association and I thought it very beautiful.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of seeing General Kean a few days ago and he<lb/>
seemed to be in excellent shape for one of his age. We went around and wished<lb/>
him a happy birthday. He showed me the copy of your letter to Mrs. Griswold.<lb/>
I am in somewhat of a quandry as to any advice concerning the matter. If you<lb/>
find it not desirable <del><unclear></unclear></del> to use the money in Cuba, I think it would be very<lb/>
well to add it to the capital assets of the Walter Reed Memorial Assn.</p>

<p>It has been the custom of the American Security and Trust<lb/>
Company to pay Mrs. Reed about the 23rd of each month. As you know, she<lb/>
died on July 23rd. After consulting General Kean, we gave the bank in-<lb/>
structions to forward the extra $50.00 to Blossom Reed at the same time<lb/>
they forwarded the regular monthly allowance of $84 in July. This will,<lb/>
of course, be the final payment of the extra $50 that has been going to<lb/>
Mrs. Reed monthly for the past year and a half. I saw Blossom and she told<lb/>
me that she would appreciate it very much if the extra allowance could be<lb/>
paid for the month of July as it would enable her to settle up a number<lb/>
of small accounts incident to her mother's last illness.</p>
<p>With very best regards and hoping that we shall have the pleasure<lb/>
of seeing you in the fall at the annual meeting,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
