FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
Will have to direct this after I reach Wash'n<lb/>
(1)<lb/>
<salute>My dear Col. Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I could not find my notes the<lb/>
evening you were at my quarters<lb/>
This is the transcript from them.</p>
<p>1). Carroll's case</p>
<p>Record-shows. C. &ldquo;was bitten on Aug 27<lb/>
2. P. M, by the following mosquitoes<lb/>
C. fasciatus&rdquo; viz</p>
<p>1- wh had bitten a y. f. patient 6 days before</p>
<p>1 " " " " " " " 4 " "</p>
<p>1 " " " " " " " 12 " "</p>
<p>1 " " " " " " " 2 " "<lb/>
became sick, Aug 30 or 31&rdquo;&ldquo;Had been<lb/>
in a foul autopsy room - of y. f-<lb/>
on Aug 24 - in late afternoon-&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carroll states - in his Galveston address<lb/>
&ldquo;Lazear made a number of unsuccess-<lb/>
ful<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00736002"/>
2.<lb/>
unsuccessful attempts with mosqui-<lb/>
toes appling <add>them</add> one or several days after<lb/>
biting&rdquo; (the y. f. patient I presume) &ldquo;as<lb/>
Finlay had done: one to himself<lb/>
10 days after biting.<del><unclear>&rdquo;</unclear></del> I reminded<lb/>
Lazear that I was ready &amp; he at last<lb/>
applied to my arm an insect<lb/>
that had bitten a patient with a<lb/>
severe attack 12 days previously&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obviously neither of these is<lb/>
at all compatible with Agra-<lb/>
monte's statement.</p>
<p>For Lazear. &ldquo;On september 13&rdquo;<lb/>
Reed (page 68) - <add><del><unclear>&ldquo;</unclear></del></add> L. was bitten by a mos,<lb/>
quito - (Culex, species undetermined)<lb/>
while<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00736003"/>
3<lb/>
While at Las Animas Hospital&rdquo;<lb/>
<hi><unclear>Developoped</unclear></hi> fever Sept, 18: 8 P. M,<lb/>
Carrol - says - same Galveston Address<lb/>
&ldquo;<del>So little attention did he&rdquo; (Lazear)</del><lb/>
&ldquo;So little importance did he attach<lb/>
to the mosquito biting him at the<lb/>
y. f. hospital that he made no note<lb/>
of it &amp; only related the circumstance<lb/>
<hi>to me</hi> when he was taken sick<lb/>
5 days later&rdquo;-</p>
<p>underscoring my own: words verbatim,</p>
<p>Mrs Gorgas has a letter from Gorgas<lb/>
written <del>just after</del> either during<lb/>
L's illness: or just after his death<lb/>
in which he states. &ldquo;<del>He says</del>&rdquo; He<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00736004"/>
4<lb/>
told me that he saw a mosqui-<lb/>
(tells me)<lb/>
to, which he believes to have been<lb/>
the one they are investigating, on<lb/>
has hand when he was in Las<lb/>
Animas &amp; he let him bite as<lb/>
long as he wanted to.</p>
<p>I don't put this in quotation marks<lb/>
because I have not the letter before<lb/>
me - but I am positive - of the expres-<lb/>
sion. &ldquo;he told me&rdquo;, or &ldquo;he tells<lb/>
me&rdquo; meaning that it was first<lb/>
hand information <add>from Lazear</add>, given when<lb/>
G. was attending him while sick.</p>
<p>I think then - taking the state-<lb/>
ments of Carroll &amp; Gorgas - the last<lb/>
especially - that the accepted account<lb/>
of<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00736005"/>
FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
C1<lb/>
B3<lb/>
5<lb/>
Lazear's infection is correct.<lb/>
&amp; that he was not infected intention-<lb/>
ally as an experiment.</p>
<p>Reed might have felt as he said<lb/>
about the insurance - but I don't<lb/>
think Carroll would have said<lb/>
that <hi>L</hi>. <del>told <hi>him</hi></del> &ldquo;told me.&rdquo; had he<lb/>
not done so. He might have simply<lb/>
related the <del>fact</del> occurrence as a<lb/>
<hi>fact</hi>, without bringing a direct<lb/>
falsehood in it. It is more improba-<lb/>
ble - as it had been more unneces-<lb/>
sary - for Gorgas to have accredit-<lb/>
ed L. with the same statement<lb/>
unless he had made it.</p>
<p>In both<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00736006"/>
FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
C1<lb/>
B3<lb/>
6<lb/>
both cases the statement is<lb/>
alleged to have been made<lb/>
in the beginning - or about the<lb/>
beginning - of L.'s illness, at<lb/>
which time there would have<lb/>
been, I judge, no special reason<lb/>
to believe he was going to die</p>
<p>I will try to get hold of Lazear's<lb/>
note book - but unless I find some<lb/>
other evidence, my opinion is<lb/>
as above</p>
