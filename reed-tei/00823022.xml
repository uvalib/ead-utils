<salute>My Dearest Daughter</salute>
</opener>
<p>The <unclear>more</unclear> I reflect on &ldquo;Dear Brutus&rdquo;<lb/>
the more I am convinced that &ldquo;a<lb/>
daughter's the thing&rdquo; after all. Barrie<lb/>
is dead right.</p>
<p>I hope you rec'd my letter - which sh'd<lb/>
have left here on the Grace boat July 30<lb/>
or 31<unclear>.</unclear> &amp; I rather expect you did- It <del><unclear>ask advis</unclear></del><lb/>
advised you to direct all my mail<lb/>
to <hi>me</hi>- Care of &ldquo;The Foundation Company<lb/>
N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 332, Calle Rifa. Lima Peru&rdquo;. They will<lb/>
send it <hi>by hand</hi> to Paita &amp; it will either<lb/>
await me there or come <hi>by hand</hi> to<lb/>
<unclear>Piura</unclear>. So I will get it, not <del>soon</del> promptly<lb/>
it<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00823023"/>
2<lb/>
it may be but with some degree of certainty</p>
<p>This letter also should reach you. It is<lb/>
going up with Mrs Grubbs - on the <hi>6</hi><hi rend="superscript">th</hi> - &amp; be<lb/>
mailed in Balboa. On this account<lb/>
I repeat the direction</p>
<p>I have had rather a long search for a yel-<lb/>
low Vicu&ntilde;a rug. Bought one <unclear>(&pound;P.10,=$47.60/100)</unclear><lb/>
in a somewhat dark store which I thought<lb/>
matched the sample- It did not - was brown<lb/>
rather than <unclear>yellow, went</unclear> over several stores<lb/>
all the same in <del>the</del> good light. Finally <del>con-</del><lb/>
went to the same store - the largest dealer<lb/>
here - &amp; as soon as the proprietor saw my<lb/>
sample - he said. It is from Bolivia. It is<lb/>
<unclear>dyed</unclear> - nearly all Bolivian skins are <unclear>dyed</unclear>&rdquo;. He<lb/>
showed me that the <hi>leather</hi> was yellowish<lb/>
not<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00823024"/>
3<lb/>
not white like that of his skins, I traded for<lb/>
one <hi>nearly</hi> yellow, as I am convinced that<lb/>
he is right &amp; that I can find no yellow skins<lb/>
in Lima, &amp; I cannot well go to La Paz - or <del>mall</del><lb/>
<unclear>Mollendo</unclear>. You can then do (1) have this<lb/>
skin died to match or (2) have a <hi>border</hi><lb/>
made of this skin - using the pieces thus saved<lb/>
from your coat to renew it where needed<lb/>
It - the one I have is a good skin - <hi>short</hi> &amp; <hi><unclear>pury</unclear></hi><lb/>
not like wool. I had a great notion to take<lb/>
a <hi>very</hi> pale skin - on account of its beautiful<lb/>
texture - which used the same way would<lb/>
only make a border more contrasting than<lb/>
this one. However - I didn't - You have a nice<lb/>
rug - <hi>not</hi> the color you wish but which I think<lb/>
can be made to serve your purpose. Indeed<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00823025"/>
4<lb/>
Indeed you will have enough to make a-<lb/>
nother coat when this one wears out. If you<lb/>
want me I can when I get ready to return get<lb/>
yet another - rug-picking it for its <hi>texture</hi>-not<lb/>
its <unclear>color. <del>If</del></unclear> such a rug would be <hi>pale</hi>-light<lb/>
<del>browns</del> browns &amp; white &amp; cream - &amp; would make a<lb/>
<hi>very</hi> pretty fur, coat or anything else to <unclear>wear,</unclear><lb/>
Basta del<del>l</del> de las Vicu&ntilde;as- They are beautiful<lb/>
however &amp; less raised - than other things- This<lb/>
one had been <del>7</del> &pound;.P. 7.00 in /14.</p>
<p><del>My</del> I have had <unclear>some</unclear> trouble with my &ldquo;Kink&rdquo;- not<lb/>
severe, as I know better how to manage it, but<lb/>
it is depressing. Have had not for the past 3<lb/>
days &amp; do <hi>hope</hi> to have a rest from it.</p>
<p>My business is not quite settled yet - <hi>all</hi> of<lb/>
last week except Monday was a fiesta our<lb/>
business done. I have put in a long Informe<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00823026"/>
5<lb/>
Informe, on the condition of the Northern pro-<lb/>
vinces as regards Y. F. &amp; have to combat-the<lb/>
unreasonable optimism of these people now as<lb/>
I had to fight their unreasonable pessi-<lb/>
mism in March &amp; April. Fortunately a<lb/>
<del><unclear>few cases case occured for</unclear></del> case was<lb/>
reported - found dead - in <unclear>Chulucanas</unclear><lb/>
a few days ago &amp; I had <del>it expressed an opin-</del> <add>the</add><lb/>
predicted that it was not over at that town<lb/>
I have more <unclear>honor</unclear> than a prophet generally<lb/>
gets. I put in my expense account <del><hi>$393,</hi></del><lb/>
$ 39<unclear>3.</unclear> &amp; $ 150 sales - which I sh'd get shortly<lb/>
- within a week- Hanson says.<lb/>
Have $200, in bank &amp; about $25 in my pocket.</p>
<p>I will meet the President this <del>afternoon</del><lb/>
afternoon &amp; am glad of it, I want to deal<lb/>
with him <hi>directly</hi> as much as possible<lb/>
not through the Jefe de la Sulubridad-<lb/>
Dr. Cardenas.</p>
<pb n="6" id="f00823027"/>
<p>6</p>
<p>I do not know, yet whether I will go up to<lb/>
Paita on the <hi>6</hi><unclear>,</unclear> with Grubbs or not. My pur-<lb/>
pose for <unclear>there</unclear> to take the northern <unclear>provinces</unclear> -<lb/>
Piura &amp; Tumbez - &amp; leave Hanson to run<lb/>
the work here <hi>Mrs H.</hi> greatly approves this<lb/>
program- <del>Probably</del> Either we both. (H &amp;I.) go<lb/>
up on the <hi>6</hi>. Hanson arrange some de-<lb/>
tails - which <hi>he</hi> ought to arrange - dispu-<lb/>
ted accounts &amp; other rows - &amp; then return<lb/>
here leaving me at Piura which sh'd<lb/>
be the head quarters of the work in the<lb/>
north. He would remain <hi>about</hi> 14 days &amp;<lb/>
continue his work here.<lb/>
Else Hanson will go by himself- I con-<lb/>
ducting &amp; attending to his work here<lb/>
When he has his disputes settled - 8 days<lb/>
<unclear>&amp;</unclear> <add>4</add> days time in transit.- I go north - settle matters<lb/>

with him<unclear>,</unclear> &amp; let him return. The <del>s last</del><lb/>
<del>in</del> first is the best for the y. f. work: the last<lb/>
best for the Lima work &amp; nearly the same for<lb/>
the y. f. work. &amp; I <hi>think</hi> will be what is done<unclear>,</unclear><lb/>
I really don't much care but <unclear>perfor</unclear> the first<lb/>
I will probably - <hi>certainly</hi> - be able to put in<lb/>
this letter <del>what</del> which plan will be followed.</p>

<p>I am wearing my ordinary <hi>winter</hi> clothes! Two<lb/>
pair of heavy drawers: one heavy flannel shirt<lb/>
over a B.V.<unclear>D</unclear>. &amp; my grey cheriot suit: when I put<lb/>
on my tail coat - Oxford grey - which is <add>lighter but</add> more<lb/>
dressy than the grey. I put on my spiral put-<lb/>
tees <del>over</del> around my legs above the knees &amp;<lb/>
also the <hi>sweater</hi> under my shirt! It is<lb/>
not specially cold - only there are no <unclear>fires</unclear> &amp;<lb/>
<hi>I</hi> am cold unless I dress as I have said<lb/>
naturally I keep warm- It is about<lb/>
5&deg; to 7&deg; or 10&deg; warmer in Piura &amp; Paita</p>
<p>Aug 5.</p>
<p>I saw the President yesterday afternoon - but the<lb/>
interview was too short to be satisfactory. I purpose<lb/>
to see him again. Hanson goes tomorrow<lb/>
to Paita- I purpose to follow him- in about 7<lb/>
days. Little time will be thus last - <hi>about</hi> 3 or 4<lb/>
days only which will be paid for by my work here.<lb/>
On the return yesterday- my pocket was picked<lb/>
I lost my watch. Bought another <unclear>-</unclear> $5 90/100 - on<lb/>

though not an expensive one.</p>
<p>Aileen says <add>-sent word-</add> she has two letters from you. I will go to<lb/>
see her this evening to hear them. I pretty<lb/>
surely have some at Payta - which I will<lb/>
get when I go there. I am anxious to get them &amp;<lb/>
go in as that work. I will feel more as if I were<lb/>
justifying my service.</p>
