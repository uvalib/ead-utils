Dr. Bert W. Caldwell,<lb/>
Calle Constitucion No. 13,<lb/>
Vera Cruz, Mexico.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Caldwell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your letter of Aug. 5th., enclosing your Report of the<lb/>
Yellow Fever Campaign in the Second Yellow Fever Zone, last night, and<lb/>
am answering as soon as I read the latter.</p>
<p>1) Your description of the sanitary condition of the 2nd. Zone in<lb/>
the beginning of 1921 is very clear. I have no map here, but know <hi>about</hi><lb/>
where the Districts and towns you mention are and so can follow you.</p>
<p>I did not know that the efficacy of fish in Mexico was first demon-<lb/>
strated<del>d</del> at Tampico<unclear>.</unclear> You imply during the work under the Associated Oil<lb/>
Managers. Just who was in direct charge? Who suggested them?</p>
<p>2) I think it was wise to divide up the too large Vera Cruz Di--<lb/>
vision and make it into two. Any area as large as this was--with the<lb/>
Tampico District--cannot be properly supervised by one man.</p>
<p>3) Your account of the fever in the Papaloapam Valley is extremely<lb/>
interesting. It is the same condition which tended to continue yellow<lb/>
fever in the sisal haciendas of Yucatan: the sugar fincas of Coro and which<lb/>
might have made the sugar and rice country of Libertad and Lambayeque<lb/>
a permanent endemic focus. Note that I draw a distinction between &ldquo;en-<lb/>
demic&rdquo; and &ldquo;permanently endemic.&rdquo; The 1st. is determined by the bio-<lb/>
logy of the Stegomyia: the 2nd. by that <hi>and</hi> the supply of susceptible<lb/>
men.</p>
<p>4) On Page 5 you note an error in the campaign in the Papaloapam<lb/>
Valley. Your criticism is just. Under the conditions as you describe<lb/>
them, to limit your work to places, or districts, infected is to take<lb/>
grave risk. It is, indeed, more important to work in places <hi>liable</hi> to<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00937009"/>
<hi>liable</hi> to<lb/>
2.<lb/>
become infected and from which it will spread--to <hi>limit</hi> the extension<lb/>
of the epidemic rather than to suppress it. Just as one throws water<lb/>
on the buildings around a burning house. I wish you could get the<lb/>
&ldquo;Loose-Leaves&rdquo; of the Article on Yellow Fever for the last half year<lb/>
(March 1922) of the Nelson Loose-Leaf Medicine, where this is briefly<lb/>
discussed. Write and ask the Publishers.</p>
<p>5) Page 6. I note with pleasure that no work was done at Tehuante-<lb/>
pec, because it was immunized by a severe and recent epidemic. Would the<lb/>
same thing have rendered Stegomyia work unnecessary at Ojitlan--or were<lb/>
non-immunes continually coming in?</p>
<p>6) Pages 7 &amp; 8: I like your account of the measures used for Stego-<lb/>
myia control and also your estimate of their comparative importance.</p>
<p>I think your estimate of <hi>8</hi> days from egg to imago is, <hi>in general</hi>,<lb/>
too short. I know Dupre's Reports, but in Panama we found 10 to 11 days<lb/>
about the minimum in nature.</p>
<p>How did you examine for larvae? Not easy to do it quickly and ef-<lb/>
ficiently.</p>
<p>7) Hanson found the <hi>Life</hi> (<hi>Pygidium punctulatum Piurae</hi> (Eigenman)--<lb/>
looks like a small cat-fish) the best for his use. Feeds at the bottom<lb/>
in the day--on the top at night. <hi>Never</hi> grows big enough to be eaten,<lb/>
nor jumps out of the water, and is very hardy. You may not have them on<lb/>
the Gulf side.</p>
<p>8) Permanent covering of cisterns is of all measures the best--ex-<lb/>
cept the doing away with them--for permenent freedom from Stegomyia, but<lb/>
needs continual inspection.</p>
<p>9) Pages 9:10 &amp; 11: I do not know the conditions in Mexico at<lb/>
first hand and so can't judge, but your <hi>principle</hi> is right. It there<lb/>
be any reasonable doubt that yellow fever is eliminated the Stegomyia<lb/>
control should be continued until this doubt becomes certainty. The<lb/>
work done would otherwise be lost--and, indeed, worse than lost--as one<lb/>
could scarcely get a community to go through a second anti-stegomyia<lb/>
campaign after what they would consider the failure of a first one.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00937010"/>
<p>first one.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>For this reason, the campaign was continued in Peru until June of<lb/>
this year--practically a year after the last reported case of yellow<lb/>
fever and up to a fairly cool season of from 3 to 4 months. Stegomyia<lb/>
control was carried out in <hi>all</hi> key-places--whether infected or not--<lb/>
some over 300 miles from any known focus.</p>
<p>10) I lay little stress on reports of isolated cases of yellow<lb/>
fever--preceeded by none for a long time and followed by none. They<lb/>
are rarely yellow fever. Such was the Grillo case in New Orleans: 1899:<lb/>
the case in New Iberia, La.: 1906:, in Colon, May 1907 etc. The Colon<lb/>
case, I feel quite sure <hi>now</hi>, was a spirochetosis--probably Weil's Dis-<lb/>
ease. I did not know at the time, but was quite sure it was not yellow<lb/>
fever.</p>
<p>With every good wish, in which Laura, who is typing this, joins</p>
