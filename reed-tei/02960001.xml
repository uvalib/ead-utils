<p>ABSTRACT OF DATA CONCERNING THE ILL_FATED TYPHOID EXPERIMENTS<lb/>
OF DR. JAMES CARROLL<lb/>
(Material in Peabody collection)</p>
<p>Letter from Major General H. L. Gilchrist to Senator Copeland, Feb. 25, 1925,<lb/>
favoring legislative action on behalf of Mr. George S. Ward.</p>
<p>Copy of Bill S 3425, 73rd Congress, Second Session. Apparently, this was<lb/>
later changed to S 45, 74th Congress, First Session, on behalf of a pension for<lb/>
Mr. Ward.</p>
<p>Summary by Dr. Philip Matz regarding official memoranda about these experiments.</p>
<p>Letters from H. L. Gilchrist, then a Colonel, April 14, 1928 and Jan. 30, 1934.</p>
<p>In May, 1904, James Carroll, then First Lieutenant, and Director of Laboratories<lb/>
in the Army Medical School proposed the vaccination of soldiers by the oral administra-<lb/>
tion of a suspension of dead typhoid bacilli. With the approval of his superiors,<lb/>
Dr. Carroll called for volunteers. Ten men were selected, including Lt. James<lb/>
Carroll, Lt. H. L. Gilchrist and others, including Private George S. Ward. Before<lb/>
the experiments began, those volunteers requested to be released, as they had a<lb/>
presentiment that something was going to happen. Dr. Carroll assembled the volunteers,<lb/>
explained the matter and in order to encourage the men to carry out the experiment,<lb/>
Lts. Gilchrist and Vedder (Carroll's assistant) took much larger doses than pre-<lb/>
scribed. Following this, each man lined up and took a dose. Results were that<lb/>
several of the men developed typhoid fever as a result of a technical failure to<lb/>
have the material thoroughly sterilized. Lt. Carroll did not have <add>typhoid</add> fever as he had<lb/>
already had it but seven of the men had undoubted attacks of typhoid fever. There<lb/>
were no deaths. The records of the men who became ill are given. Few investigations<lb/>
were made as the diagnosis seemed definite and &ldquo;it was decided to give no undue<lb/>
publicity to these cases.&rdquo;</p>
