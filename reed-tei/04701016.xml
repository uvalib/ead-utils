<salute>My dear doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am in receipt of your kind letter of Dec. 24th to which I did not<lb/>
reply earlier because it was probably caught in the holiday rush and it arrived considerably<lb/>
late. I am very happy that you sent not only the material I wanted on yellow fever but<lb/>
the pamphlet on Cortisone, and I wish to thank you for both.</p>
<p>For quite some time I had known about your interest in locating the<lb/>
exact spot of Camp Lazear, in Marianao, but the details in your address before Alpha Omega<lb/>
Alpha have come to elucidate a point in my mind as to why was General Kean so insistent<lb/>
in his letters to Drs. Angl&eacute;s and Dom&iacute;nguez about the exact location of the campsite. It was<lb/>
evidently to back your stand on the subject. Your noticing the abandoned RR spur to La Playa<lb/>
in addition to been a keen observation demonstrates your sincere interest in this matter.</p>
<p>After I wrote to the Librarian at the Mayo Clinic in an effort to<lb/>
obtain the details I sought about you, and before receiving your reply, I read in a Cuban<lb/>
daily that you had been promoted to Commander of the National Order of Carlos J. Finlay and<lb/>
it gave me much pleasure since this is a small way to show the Cuban's appreciation of<lb/>
your friendship and interest in the little nation.</p>
<p>For the past eleven years I have been compiling material for a biography<lb/>
of Dr. Finlay and I am now engaged in the actual task. So very little has been truthfully<lb/>
said about him that the tremendous importance of his trail blazing has been lost in the<lb/>
dust of Dr. Reed's chariot as far as nearly all of the yellow fever literature in the United<lb/>
is concerned. And this is a grave injustice which the American people would not have<lb/>
countenanced had they been given the true historical facts from the beginning. Had there never<lb/>
been a Carlos Finlay the equation of yellow fever would have been solved by some other man<lb/>
at some other time but it would not have been solved by Major Reed in some 30 or 40 days<lb/>
of actual work in 1900. This much is true and that is what I am endeavoring to demonstrate,<lb/>
that the the greatest medical discovery in the history of the New World, and even one of the<lb/>
greatest in the annals of the medical sciences of all times, rests squarely upon the solid<lb/>
foundation which Finlay built for the other great men to work on.</p>

<p>AC<lb/>
Hms</p>
<p>In this connection I am also happy to know that you are collecting<lb/>
documents such as those of Mrs. Lazear and Mrs. Reed, etc. To have all of these papers together<lb/>
with the Army records for posterity to go <add>to</add> as a source of authentic data is a most praise-<lb/>
worthy task for which you are to be congratulated.- Perhaps I will need some additional<lb/>
information which I will request from you, if you permit me to do so.</p>
<p>I hope that you find your stay in Cuba a pleasant one and I beg<lb/>
to remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours</salute>
