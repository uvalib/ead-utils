<salute>My dear Hutch:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been so busy trying to finish another paper that I haven't had time to<lb/>
write you as to the final form in which you want my talk. I am perfectly willing to con-<lb/>
dense it and speak for twenty minutes at the least and thirty minutes at the most. I am<lb/>
writing Dr. Sawyer, as I am so anxious to find out how much of the general story he is<lb/>
going to cover. I read between the lines of your letter and strongly suspect what I am<lb/>
beginning to believe myself, that were I to give a synopsis of the whole story Saturday<lb/>
night, it might be so repetitious as to be boring. With the story dramatized Friday night<lb/>
and possibly described by Dr. Sawyer in some detail Saturday morning, a third telling in<lb/>
the evening might be, as I have said, boring. Therefore, I suspect that you want me to<lb/>
confine my remarks almost exclusively to Lazear, and probably even to my new discoveries<lb/>
of Lazear, with that minimum of background which will be necessary. I am so used to talk-<lb/>
ing with slides and I have such a yen for photographs, that I had originally planned to<lb/>
give an illustrated talk, showing the photographs of the actual camp, unpublished photo-<lb/>
graphs of Lazear in Havana, a photograph of the room where he presumably got accidental<lb/>
yellow fever, also one of the present temporary memorial, etc. However, I gather that you<lb/>
prefer that the talk not be in the nature of an illustrated lecture, but a rather semi-<lb/>
formal tribute to Lazear. I can assure you that I will do whatever you wish, and if the<lb/>
latter is your wish, I will at once start writing out my draft. Please let me know at<lb/>
your earliest convenience, and don't hesitate to tell me what you want. As you know, I<lb/>
have entirely too much material for one or several talks. I have become so interested in<lb/>
it that I plan to write it up, probably in a series of papers, or perhaps even in book<lb/>
form, some months or years from now. There is still much research to do on the problem.</p>
<p>I think the wording in your tentative certificate of recognition is quite nice,<lb/>
and I have no notable suggestion to make. I wonder whether there should be a period after<lb/>
each paragraph. I should think they ought to be omitted.</p>
<p>I doubt that Kissinger and Moran would resent Cooke's presence, or his reception<lb/>
of a similar certificate. After all, when Cooke volunteered for the infected clothing<lb/>
experiments, he did not know that he might not get the disease, and therefore, to all<lb/>
intents and purposes, he was volunteering his life as well as they. If you feel at all<lb/>
disturbed about this, I should think <del>we</del><add>you</add> had better not invite Cooke. I have just had a<lb/>
letter from Dean Jordan, from the University of Virginia, in which he tells me they are<lb/>
planning to re-invite Moran and are also inviting Dr. Cooke. I had planned to suggest<lb/>
this but forgot it, as he lives, as you know, not far from Charlottesville, and so far<lb/>
as I know, has not received any special recognition. I will write General Kean and ask<lb/>
his opinion. He know the setup more than anybody else and he know just how small or great<lb/>
Dr. Cooke's contribution was.</p>
<p>Please write me at once about the type of talk you wish, slides or no slides, and<lb/>
please also tell me whether I will have to make any other remarks, on any other occasion.<lb/>
I am beginning to get cold feet!</p>
<p>Has Buddy Groves arrived and do you know his address? Could <unclear>be</unclear> join us and get<lb/>
tight <unclear>with</unclear> us Saturday night?</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
