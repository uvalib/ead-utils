<p>&ldquo;Note by Editor: The date of the beginning of the warfare against<lb/>
Yellow Fever in Havana is epochal, and therefore of interest and importance.<lb/>
The date, Feb. 4, 1901, given by General Winter, is from the final Report of<lb/>
Gorgas as Chief Sanitary Officer of Havana (dated Washington, July 12, 1902)<lb/>
and it seems certain that it was a clerical error. The reasons for thinking<lb/>
so are that he was not at that time a convert to the mosquito theory, as for-<lb/>
mulated by Reed, and in other articles he gives a later date. In the same<lb/>
report, he states (page 3):</p>
<p>&ldquo;In February, 1901, Dr. Reed read a paper before the<lb/>
International Sanitary Congress in Habana giving the results<lb/>
of their work. The idea was so new and so entirely contrary<lb/>
to all former theories on the subject, and apparently to all<lb/>
former theories on the subject, and apparently to all former<lb/>
experience that the paper was received with scanty belief. I<lb/>
myself had seen the work and was convinced that the mosquito<lb/>
<hi>could convey</hi> yellow fever but I was hardly prepared to believe<lb/>
that it was the only way <hi>or even the ordinary way</hi> of conveying<lb/>
the disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a pamphlet prepared at the request of Surgeon General O'Reilly<lb/>
for distribution to Medical and Sanitary Officers (A Few General Directions<lb/>
With Regard to Destroying Mosquitoes, particularly the Yellow Fever Mosquito.<lb/>
By W. C. Gorgas, Col. M. C., U.S. Army, Gov. Printing Office, 1904), Colonel<lb/>
Gorgas states (page 10 speaking of house inspections for breeding places):</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the first report on this subject, I think it was in<lb/>
March, 1901, we found that we had in Havana in the neighborhood<lb/>
of 26,000 different water deposits which contained wigglers, most<lb/>
of them of the yellow fever variety.......The report of January,<lb/>
1902, after about <hi>ten months</hi> of this mosquito work showed that<lb/>
within the city limits less than 300 promises had wigglers upon<lb/>
them&rdquo;. (Italics in above quotations are the Editor's)</p>
<p>Reed gives the date of beginning work as February 15, and this<lb/>
doubtless refers to the formulation of plans at Sanitary Headquarters rather<lb/>
than the activities of mosquito squads in the patios of Havana. It is a<lb/>
safe bet that any physical attack on the mosquito in the City of Havana before<lb/>
the first of March, 1901 was limited to the ancient and automatic manual<lb/>
response to the stimulus of a bite.</p>
