<salute>My dear Doctor Kelly:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have received the documents enclosed to me under date of November twenty-<lb/>
fifth referring to the Kissinger matter, and I have also received your book<lb/>
upon Walter Reed, which I shall value very highly.</p>
<p>I understood in a letter from Dr. Welch that he left the matter to you and<lb/>
to me, and that he would agree to take any action that we settled upon. Have<lb/>
you any suggestions to make? Would another appeal to the Carnegie people backed<lb/>
by Welch, yourself and me as the President of the Association of Pathologists<lb/>
and Bacteriologists, or by a larger committee, have any influence? Do you think<lb/>
this should be done at once, or do you think that an appeal to the general pub-<lb/>
lic in the newspapers of the country, or to the medical profession through the<lb/>
medical journals, would be the proper course, or do you think that the two had<lb/>
best be combined?</p>
<p>In case you approve of a general appeal, would you allow your name to be<lb/>
used, together with that of Dr. Welch and mine? Will you suggest any other names<lb/>
to be added for such a committee, for example, perhaps Hektoen or Billings of<lb/>
Chicago, or both; Vaughan, Novy or Warthin of Ann Arbor; possibly Adami of<lb/>
Montreal; Prudden, Flexner or Ewing of New York. Perhaps it would be well to<lb/>
put in a number of clinicians, and if you think it best to carry out that sug-<lb/>
gestion, I should be glad if you would give me the names of some of those that<lb/>
you think should be included. Personally I feel that a small committee is<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02952001"/>
likely to have as much influence as a larger one, and, at any rate, that its<lb/>
working capacity will be better.</p>
<p>If you consent, I shall be entirely willing to constitute myself the cor-<lb/>
responding force in the matter, and would see that some sort of an appeal should<lb/>
be sent to a number of medical journals, and to a number of influential papers<lb/>
in different parts of the country. Of course a treasurer should be selected,<lb/>
and for that purpose I feel justified in offering the services of Mr. F. L.<lb/>
Higginson, a banker of this city. I merely make that suggestion because I<lb/>
know him quite well personally, and am confident that he would serve.</p>
<p>It seems to me from the condition of the man whatever is done should be<lb/>
done quickly, and I take it that Dr. Dean of South Bend knows the individual<lb/>
well enough to be called upon for information.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Harold C. Ernst</signed>.
Dr. Howard A. Kelly.<lb/>
