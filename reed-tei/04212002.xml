<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>We received a call from the Hall of Fame in New York about<lb/>
supplying plates for their program on the Yellow Fever exhibit<lb/>
and ceremonies which will be held on May 16. Miss Lyons<lb/>
advised that you had given her my name, which was quite in order.</p>
<p>I have asked Mr. Roley, who handles our publicity work on<lb/>
these paintings, to cooperate in every way possible. I have not<lb/>
yet heard any details of the program but we shall be glad to be<lb/>
of assistance.</p>
<p>I am more or less sponsoring a young man, Thomas Noone, in<lb/>
his career as a doctor and on Sunday, while he was visiting my<lb/>
home, I asked him what he plans to do after he has served his<lb/>
internship at Cooper Hospital on June 30. He said he would like<lb/>
to get an internship or fellowship in O.B. or G.U. work in some<lb/>
hospital because the residencies at Cooper are mortgaged until<lb/>
1952.</p>
<p>When I jokingly asked him if he would be interested in the<lb/>
Mayo Clinic he said this was far beyond his dreams and could not<lb/>
see any such possibility. I do not know what the requirements<lb/>
are or whether there is a chance of a fellowship at the Clinic<lb/>
but thought I would ask you if there is any opportunity for a<lb/>
bright young man to make the grade there.</p>
<p>copied for<lb/>
<hi>Foundation files/<unclear>st</unclear></hi></p>
<p>He attended the University of Pennsylvania on the acceler-<lb/>
ated pre-medical program during the war and after that Dr. Eben<lb/>
Carey of Marquette reviewed his marks and admitted him to that<lb/>
school. He graduated in the upper third in a class of 88. I<lb/>
then sponsored him at Cooper Hospital in Camden for internship,<lb/>
where he will finish in June.</p>
<p>He is now only 23 years old and feels he could spend<lb/>
several years as a resident and then really be fitted to go into<lb/>
Wyeth<lb/>

<p>If you have any thoughts in this matter, I would be glad to<lb/>
hear from you, as I would like to see Tom go through.</p>
<p>If you will be in New York in May I will no doubt see you;<lb/>
meanwhile, anytime you are in the East you are very welcome at<lb/>
