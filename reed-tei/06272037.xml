Prof. James E. Peabody, The Morris High School,<lb/>

My dear Prof. Peabody:</p>
<p>Your letter has just come with the galley of the illustrations<lb/>
of your article. That Figure 14 is certainly no joke on me, because I<lb/>
have not and never had the remotest connection with it. People who like<lb/>
practical jokes might think it a joke on Gorgas because it certainly is<lb/>
a most unflattering picture of him, but it is he all right. I will look<lb/>
up a picture as soon as I go home and sent it to you. I will try to find<lb/>
you one of those days when I was a Major. As you have three pictures of<lb/>
Kissinger and one of Jernegan, why don't you have a picture of Moran who<lb/>
was the real hero of that bunch, the man who volunteered at the same<lb/>
time as Kissinger, who always refused to accept any gratuity and has<lb/>
always shown a fine spirit of dignity and independence. I think we can<lb/>
probably scrape up a picture of him if you want it. His present address<lb/>
is John J. Moran, Empedrado 22, Havana, Cuba.</p>
<p>o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o</p>
<p>With best wishes, I am,<lb/>
Very sincerely yours,<lb/>
J. R. KEAN,<lb/>
Colonel, U. S. Army, Retired.</p>

My dear Professor Peabody:</p>
<p>I am sending you by separate enclosure a photographic reproduct-<lb/>
ion of the contract between Major Reed and Antonio Benino and two photo-<lb/>
graphs of Camp Lazear, and also a photograph of me taken when in Cuba. I<lb/>
have not been able to put my hands on a photograph of Moran, although I am<lb/>
pretty sure I have one somewhere. I am sending you to read his letter to me.<lb/>
Please return it when you are through with it. The letter gives his present<lb/>
address.</p>
<p>You ask whether I think you are stressing Kissinger too much. I<lb/>
have no criticism to make of your fine and generous enthusiasm for Kissinger,<lb/>
and prefer to say you have stressed Moran too little. He was without doubt<lb/>
the finest and strongest character of the group of men infected at Camp Lazear,<lb/>
and my recollection is that he and Kissinger volunteered at the same time.<lb/>
They were the first to be bitten by mosquitoes that were infected, but for<lb/>
some reason Moran was not infected, when bitten on November 26th (1900) or<lb/>
November 29th by mosquitoes brought to him in test tubes and placed on his<lb/>
arm. He was the first one to be infected by mosquitoes in the natural way<lb/>
when they were liberated in a room in a little house on the left hand side<lb/>
of the photograph #40731 and he came down on Christmas Day, 1900. You re-<lb/>
member Reed made a very dramatic illustration of what was meant by an infected<lb/>

room by dividing this building into two rooms by a mosquito wire part-<lb/>
ition only; on one side of the wire partitions non-immunes slept safely,<lb/>
while the men who went into the other side in which there were infected<lb/>
mosquitoes came down with the fever.</p>
<p>Very sincerely yours,<lb/>
J. R. KEAN,<lb/>
Colonel, U. S. Army, Retired.</p>
