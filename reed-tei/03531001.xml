<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Ever<del><unclear>y</unclear></del> since I received your letter dated March 12th,<lb/>
I have been in a quandary as to whether or not I could assure you<lb/>
that I would be in Havana from April 8th to to 12th, inclusive, so as<lb/>
to do justice to the matter we both have in mind. It all hinges on<lb/>
the plans for arrival here of a Mining Engineer, whose name I do not<lb/>
even know, whom I MUST accompany on a visit of inspection of Sun Oil<lb/>
Company's mining properties in the Province of Oriente. Even my Home<lb/>
Office cannot inform me as to the expected date of his arrival here,<lb/>
thus leaving me &ldquo;up in the air&rdquo;, so to speak. The Director of our<lb/>
Foreign Department has been with me during the last week, having left<lb/>
last night on the Ward Liner &ldquo;ORIENTE&rdquo; for New York. You can imagine<lb/>
that I had a hectic week with him, showing him around, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Everything considered, I think you had better carry<lb/>
out the plan outlined in your letter, that is to say, to arrive here<lb/>
on or about April 8th. Come what may, I will hold the Engineer here<lb/>
in Havana so as to give you the most of two days, instead of spreading<lb/>
it over three or four days. The only fly in the ointment is that he<lb/>
might arrive around the fourth of April. In such an event, I would<lb/>
be with him for eight days at least, perhaps ten. Should he arrive<lb/>
here on the first of April, chances are we would be back to Havana on<lb/>
the 9th or 10th, which would allow me sufficient time to spend three<lb/>
or four days with you without interruption. There will be but little<lb/>
limit on the time I can devote to you if I do not have to leave Havana.<lb/>
I am my own boss in Cuba and my office manager can take care of the<lb/>
business end of it. As soon as the Engineer arrives I will send you<lb/>
a cable indicative of the date, more or less, of my return to Havana.<lb/>
Should he arrive here on the same date as you plan to arrive here, I<lb/>
could hold him up for two days while he looks Havana over. I can find<lb/>
a number of pretexts for so doing. By all means, I want you to come<lb/>
on to Havana and will arrange somehow to give you practically two days'<lb/>
full time, including some time in the evening, if you do not mind.</p>
