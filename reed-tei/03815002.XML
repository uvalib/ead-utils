<title>Letter from Philip Showalter Hench to Emilie Lawrence Reed, June 17, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Hench sends Reed a copy of a talk he has given at the dedication of the Lazear Memorial Building at Washington and Jefferson College. He mentions the possibility of visiting her later. He also inquires as to whom she might have given some of her husband's letters, especially those from October 1900 to January 1901.</p>

To Mrs Walter Reed<lb/>

<salute>My dear Mrs. Reed:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I certainly appreciated having your nice letter expressing your<lb/>
interest in the talk which I gave in Cleveland at the unveiling of the<lb/>
painting, &ldquo;Conquerors of Yellow Fever&rdquo;. As I have written your daughter,<lb/>
I can only assure you that my tribute to your husband and his colleagues was<lb/>
a most sincere one. I have spent much time studying this story, have visited<lb/>
many of the survivors and have visited Cuba twice.</p>
<p>By separate post I am sending you a copy of the talk given by me<lb/>
at the dedication of the Lazear Memorial Building at Washington and Jefferson<lb/>
College, last October. You will forgive me, I am sure, for emphasizing the<lb/>
work of Lazear on that particular occasion since you will understand that it<lb/>
was given at the dedication of the Lazear Memorial. It is my hope to be able<lb/>
to write a full and complete story of the work of all those connected with<lb/>
the marvelous conquest of yellow fever. To that end I gratefully accepted<lb/>
the invitation of your daughter to visit you and her at some time in the<lb/>
near future. I do not believe that I will be able to get East again until<lb/>
some time next Fall but I hope to visit Washington to see General Ireland<lb/>
and General Kean again and to look up some of your husband's records in the<lb/>
Surgeon General's office. Perhaps then, if it is convenient for you, I<lb/>
might run up to pay you a brief visit for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>I asked your daughter if she knew to whom you had given various<lb/>
letters of your husband. I have learned more from some of his letters than<lb/>
from many other sources and regret indeed that the letters which your daughter<lb/>
allowed me contain very few references, for example, to the month of October,<lb/>
1900 and to January, 1901. If you remember at least the names of some of the<lb/>
physicians and institutions to which you sent these letters, I would be very<lb/>
glad indeed to write to at least some of them and get copies of them. Already<lb/>
I have acquired quite a lot of material. Dr. Kelly of Baltimore, whom I visited<lb/>
last month, most graciously handed over his whole collection of material to me<lb/>
and General Kean has given me much help as has General Truby. My sole purpose<lb/>
in this labor of love is to present to the world a comprehensive and adequate<lb/>
story that will add to the glory of all those concerned with this conquest.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
