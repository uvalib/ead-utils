Colonel J. F. Siler, Secretary<lb/>
WALTER REED MEMORIAL ASSOCIATION<lb/>
3434--34th Place, North West<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Siler:</salute>
</opener>
<p>By separate post I have sent you some enlargements of the<lb/>
small snapshots which I took on the occasion of our recent meeting.<lb/>
I have sent similar enlargements, not only to the other men in the<lb/>
photographs, but also to Mrs. Walter Reed and Blossom and to General<lb/>
and Mrs. Reed.</p>
<p><del>If you think that the other Members of the Board who were<lb/>
not there would like copies, I will send them small contact prints.<lb/>
I don't suppose they will particularly care to have enlargements. If<lb/>
you wish me to do this, please send me the addresses of General Reynolds<lb/>
and General Keefer. I have Doctor Howard's address.</del></p>
<p><del>I thoroughly enjoyed the meeting. I have been so very busy<lb/>
since returning that I haven't yet had a chance to type up an abstract<lb/>
of the remarks I made but I will do so in the very near future. Would<lb/>
one copy for you be sufficient or would you like to have me send you<lb/>
eight or nine copies? We could make that many (but not more) on the<lb/>
first run if we use onion-skin paper. Please accept my sincere<lb/>
Christmas greetings.</del></p>
<closer>
<salute><del>Sincerely,</del></salute>
<signed><del>P. S. Hench, M. D.</del></signed>
<del>PSH:alp</del><lb/>
<seg>
P. S. Please don't judge these little enlargements in the light of<lb/>
a professional job. I took them with a little $5 &ldquo;flash&rdquo; Brownie.<lb/>
Colonel Siler, do you know any one still living who heard<lb/>
Walter Reed give his first paper at Indianapolis? I am so anxious to<lb/>
find someone. General Truby recently told me about Doctor Ravanel<lb/>
who had been there. I wrote him but most unfortunately he had just<lb/>
died a short time before.<lb/>
Did you ever know of, or see, or hear of General Sternberg's<lb/>
written instructions to Reed in connection with the formation of the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04122008"/>
Colonel J. F. Siler, Secretary<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
December 19, 1946<lb/>
Yellow Fever Board? I have never seen them in the National Archives<lb/>
Building--I have poured over hundreds of documents and never came<lb/>
across that; however, in the biography of Sternberg, written by his<lb/>
wife, some remarks of Sternberg are published in which he mentions<lb/>
written instructions to Reed. Elsewhere Agramonte spoke of Sternberg's<lb/>
verbal instructions to Reed. Of course, I have the Order creating the<lb/>
Board but this contains nothing comparable to what Sternberg says he<lb/>
wrote to Reed. General Kean never heard of any written instructions<lb/>
to Reed. If such were given, it is a mystery to me why I can't locate<lb/>
them.<lb/>
<del>In Washington I tried to get in touch with Colonel La Garde.<lb/>
He was not in the Pentagon Building when I was there but I had a very<lb/>
nice telephone conversation with him. He told me that he hadn't seen<lb/>
George Carroll since the latter was a boy and he has had no contact<lb/>
with the Carroll family for many many years. He was afraid, therefore,<lb/>
that he could not help me out.<lb/>
I went to see Mr. L. E. Reed (no relation) again--he was<lb/>
Sergeant Tracy's son-in-law and I had seen him in May, 1946. Mr. Reed<lb/>
had tried to contact Carroll on a couple occasions but Carroll had<lb/>
proved just as elusive to him as he had to me. On one occasion Carroll<lb/>
did not even let him come inside the house. Mr. Reed probably omitted<lb/>
any mention of me and my interest and approached Carroll with the idea<lb/>
that he, Reed, wanted to write up a little story about his father-in-<lb/>
law, Mr. Tracy. Mr. Reed told me that frankly he thinks George Carroll<lb/>
is &ldquo;crazy.&rdquo; I heartily agree.<lb/>
I wrote down Colonel La Garde's address on a piece of hotel<lb/>
stationery but for the life of me since my return I have been unable<lb/>
to find it. It will turn up in due time; but, in the meantime, will<lb/>
you kindly send me his initials so that I may write him.</del><lb/>
