<salute>Dearest Mumsie,</salute>
</opener>
<p>The things from<lb/>
Sterns came early yes-<lb/>
terday morning, and<lb/>
I got your letter this<lb/>
morning, for father, with<lb/>
great presence of wind,<lb/>
concealed it on the<lb/>
hall mantle- piece be-<lb/>
fore he went to town<lb/>
Tuesday morning. How-<lb/>
ever it made no dif-<lb/>
ference and the things<lb/>
are lovely. I was so<lb/>
surprised and delighted<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14314002"/>
with my <unclear>kimono,</unclear> and<lb/>
it seems to me it was<lb/>
very cheap for such a<lb/>
lovely one. Helen and I<lb/>
went into raptures over<lb/>
the baby's coat, which<lb/>
is certainly much more<lb/>
ornamental, if not quite<lb/>
as useful as the two<lb/>
outing flannel wrappers<lb/>
you made <unclear>me</unclear> put on<lb/>
the list, insisting that<lb/>
a coat was quite un-<lb/>
necessary.</p>
<p>Helen's room is being<lb/>
fumigated today, for<lb/>
we could not get the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14314003"/>
lamp any sooner, and I am expect-<lb/>
ing Mr. Meeker any minute to take<lb/>
down the wooden bed, and put up<lb/>
the fine, new iron one that is<lb/>
standing in the hall. The mattress<lb/>
is promised for today. Helen had<lb/>
to go into town today to lunch<lb/>
with Miss Gray, so Marie and I<lb/>
are running the house to suit our-<lb/>
selves. Helen is likewise to do some<lb/>
errands in town, in which you<lb/>
would probably not take any interest<lb/>
so I won't tell you what they are.<lb/>
I went to market this morning<lb/>
and bought two money orders to<lb/>
send Doll. One for ten pesos for Miss<lb/>
Cochrane and one for fifteen for Doll<lb/>
herself. Father had some five compli-<lb/>
cated scheme of bank drafts, express<lb/>
orders etc., but my brain being unused<lb/>
to such refinements I <del>e</del> was so com-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14314004"/>
monplace as to cash<lb/>
his check and buy two<lb/>
money-orders, which I<lb/>
will have in the mail<lb/>
before the Gov. returns<lb/>
from town. A letter<lb/>
came from Tom saying<lb/>
he would leave for<lb/>
St. Louis on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and<lb/>
would write from there<lb/>
the exact date of his<lb/>
arriving at home. I<lb/>
don't know if father<lb/>
sent the letter on to<lb/>
you, but he will tele-<lb/>
graph you as soon as<lb/>
Tom writes again.</p>
<pb n="5" id="f14314005"/>
<p>I got two letters from<lb/>
Rannie last night.<lb/>
If it was not for<lb/>
our dear, little General<lb/>
Rannie's leave would<lb/>
have been a thing of<lb/>
the distant future,<lb/>
for Gen. Wood disap-<lb/>
proved it for the present.<lb/>
When Rannie <del>to</del> showed<lb/>
it to the General he<lb/>
told him not to write<lb/>
me about it, and he<lb/>
climbed into his bug-<lb/>
gy and drove down to<lb/>
see Gen. Wood. He finally<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14314006"/>
fixed it, so that if the fever is<lb/>
stamped out Rannie can take his<lb/>
leave at the end of the month, and<lb/>
our General is to decide. Isn't he<lb/>
the dearest most kind hearted old<lb/>
gentleman? They have had eleven<lb/>
cases so far, only one from the post,<lb/>
the rest from one place on the calzada<lb/>
about 100 yds. square between Gen. Lee<lb/>
St. and Maceo, and Rannie's last letter<lb/>
said things were looking much brighter,<lb/>
so I trust no new foci will appear.<lb/>
I met Mrs. Gamble up town today<lb/>
and we had a most friendly and<lb/>
affectionate chat. The boys are well<lb/>
and cheerful, and everything is run-<lb/>
ning smoothly, the new handmaiden<lb/>
being very superior, likewise strong and<lb/>
willing. Don't work too hard Mumsie<lb/>
and I am quite provoked at you for taking<lb/>
any sewing with you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most lovingly</salute>
<signed>Louise</signed>.
Teeter has quite a bad case of fever, but Rannie thinks he will get well.<lb/>
</closer>
