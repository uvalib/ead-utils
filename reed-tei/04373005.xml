<p>Gibson informs Hench that he is planning a biography of Sternberg. He learned about Hench's interest in Reed from a recent newspaper article, and would like access any Reed-Sternberg material from Hench's collection. Gibson also mentions having published a biography on Gorgas.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>For some time I have been collecting material for my forthcoming<lb/>
biography of General George Miller Sternberg. General Sternberg, as I am sure<lb/>
you do not need to be told, was Surgeon General of the Army from 1893 to 1902.</p>
<p>For that reason, I read with great interest indeed the Associated Press story<lb/>
on Mrs. Blossom Reed, of Blue Ridge Summit, Pa., daughter of Major Walter Reed,<lb/>
who was closely associated with General Sternberg in a number of bacteriological<lb/>
experiments, including and particularly the Havana studies that led to the<lb/>
adoption of the mosquito theory of yellow fever transmission. I also found most<lb/>
interesting the final paragraph of the <unclear>A. P.</unclear> story, as published in the Montgomery<lb/>
paper, stating that letters and other Reed material were included in a yellow<lb/>
fever collection now in your charge.</p>
<p>I am sure you readily realize how valuable such material would be to my<lb/>
Sternberg biography. I presume that you have a number of letters from Reed to Stern-<lb/>
berg and from Sternberg to Reed, and I am anxious to see these, if I possibly can.<lb/>
Through the kindness of members of General Sternberg's family and others, I have<lb/>
obtained a great deal of material for the book, but I particularly wish to get a<lb/>
number of unpublished letters and other unpublished material. And of course material<lb/>
dealing with the yellow fever investigations would be a prize indeed.</p>
<p>How can I obtain access to any Reed-Sternberg material in your collection?<lb/>
Could I have it copied without too great expense, or photostated? Or could I have<lb/>
the use of the originals on my solemn promise to see that they are taken care of<lb/>
and promptly returned after being studied and copied? To protect you on that<lb/>
score, I shall be glad to make a deposit of a <unclear>reasonable</unclear> amount, to be returned<lb/>
upon the return of the material.</p>
<p>You may have seen my biography of General William C. Gorgas, <unclear>published</unclear> last<lb/>
fall. It is now in a second printing after a friendly and indeed pleasant critical<lb/>
and public reception. You probably have seen some of the reviews. I am enclosing<lb/>
a leaflet describing the book.</p>
<p>I am also sending along a stamped and addressed envelope for your convenience in<lb/>
replying.</p>
<p>I assure you of my grateful appreciation of your help in making this material<lb/>
available to me.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
