Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>

<salute>My dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you so much for your letter of February 16th.</p>
<p>I took up with a number of the members of the Board of the Walter<lb/>
Reed Memorial Association the matter of making a change in the inscription<lb/>
to be placed on the plaque, and after talking with four or five who live<lb/>
here in Washington, it was felt that your suggestion:<lb/>
WALTER REED<lb/>
the conqueror of yellow fever<lb/>
died in a hospital<lb/>
on this site<lb/>
November 23- 1902<lb/>
would be very satisfactory. When I called up Doctor Soper concerning the<lb/>
question of making the change, he felt that it would not be quite right to<lb/>
use the term &ldquo;conqueror of yellow fever.&rdquo; I am enclosing herewith a copy<lb/>
of his letter for your information.</p>
<p>After receiving Doctor Soper's letter, I consulted General Kean<lb/>
concerning the whole matter, and we both feel that your suggestion -<lb/>
&ldquo;the conqueror of yellow fever&rdquo; is quite satisfactory, but if any change<lb/>
should be considered, it might be well to give consideration to the follow-<lb/>
ing change, which will incorporate, in substance, the statement made by<lb/>
President Eliot, of Harvard, many years ago:<lb/>
WALTER REED<lb/>
who gave man control over yellow fever<lb/>
died in a hospital<lb/>
on this site<lb/>
November 23- 1902</p>
<p>This morning I consulted the Lamb Seal &amp; Stencil Co., who will<lb/>
make the sign for us, concerning the feasibility of making these two changes.<lb/>
They are preparing a new sketch, showing the size of the lettering which<lb/>
would have to be used in each of the two types of wording, and when we have<lb/>
received that, we will come to a final decision. I may say, for your in-<lb/>
formation, that I think your suggestion - &ldquo;the conqueror of yellow fever&rdquo;<lb/>
is quite all right. As soon as we come to some definite decision I will,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04325007"/>
Dr. Hench<lb/>
page 2<lb/>
of course, advise you concerning the matter.</p>
<p>I presume that you have received a letter from a Mr. Wallach, en-<lb/>
closing copies of the Resolutions introduced in Congress to honor the<lb/>
memory of Walter Reed. Personally, I feel that the sum of $350,000 over<lb/>
a period of 3 years could be spent much more advantageously in honoring<lb/>
Walter Reed's memory than through educational publicity, as suggested in<lb/>
the Resolutions. I, of course, feel as you do - that something should be<lb/>
done to bring to the attention of the people of this country the accomplish-<lb/>
ments of Walter Reed during this, the 50th Anniversary Year of his work,<lb/>
and I had understood that it was your intention to get some outstanding<lb/>
writers to cover the matter in articles in journals.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for offering to send the reprints. I am sure<lb/>
that the Surgeon General will be delighted to get them for distribution<lb/>
to members of the Corps.</p>
<p>I wonder if you have heard of the death, recently, of Osborne<lb/>
Wood. It was my feeling that you would be interested in this because of<lb/>
your recent contacts with his sister, Miss Wood.</p>
<p>Please do not bother to answer this letter, as I know you are<lb/>
very, very busy, and we all fell that you must take the very best care<lb/>
of yourself.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>J.F. Siler, Col., U.S.A. (Ret.)</signed>
