IN REPLY REFER TO S.G.O.----------------------------------------------<lb/>
ANT-VTB<lb/>
FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY<lb/>

<salute>My dear Dr. Kelly:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Referring again to your letter of October 13th,<lb/>
Mrs. Reed has just now called me by telephone. She knew<lb/>
nothing of the case of Miss Clara Louise Maass (the name<lb/>
of the nurse concerning whom you asked), but from the<lb/>
office of the Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps in<lb/>
the Surgeon General's Office, <unclear>I</unclear> learned that Miss Maass<lb/>
died in August, 1901, of yellow fever following the bite<lb/>
of an infected mosquito to which she had voluntarily sub-<lb/>
mitted. The purpose of this voluntary action is not def-<lb/>
initely known but it is thought that her hope was to become<lb/>
immune through suffering a mild attack of the disease as the<lb/>
result of being bitten by an old mosquito that had not for<lb/>
several weeks or months been permitted to bite yellow fever<lb/>
patients. However, so far as concerns the purposes of her<lb/>
action there is nothing more available than surmise. She<lb/>
had been an army nurse, but her contract had been annulled<lb/>
on May 7, 1900. Whether she had remained continuously in<lb/>
Havana following her separation from the service or whether<lb/>
she had visited the United States and then returned to Ha-<lb/>
vana cannot be with certainty established. At any rate the<lb/>
Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps was quite sure that<lb/>
immediately previous to her death she had been doing private<lb/>
nursing or other professional work among Army and Navy people<lb/>
stationed in Cuba.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed knows nothing of any monument ever having<lb/>
been erected to Major Reed's memory either in Havana or Panama.<lb/>
General Noble is quite sure that no such monument has ever ap-<lb/>
peared in Panama and he suggests that Dr. Agramonte, now Minister<lb/>
of Health for Cuba, might give you definite information as to<lb/>
what has or has not been done in Havana.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed asked me to convey to you her very kindest<lb/>
regards. She also asked me to invite your attention to the fact<lb/>
that Congress has recently increased the pension granted Mrs. Gorgas,<lb/>
but that no similar action has ever been taken in her case. She<lb/>
expressed herself as believing this to be an unjust discrimination.<lb/>
I promised her to transmit both of these messages to you.</p>

<p>We have here in the Library what I consider to be<lb/>
a very excellent portrait of General Sternberg. Personally<lb/>
I think it is as good a one as I have ever seen, though<lb/>
there is always of course the possible question of taste.<lb/>
I believe our portrait would make a very excellent illustra-<lb/>
tion for the chapter in your book on General Sternberg.<lb/>
Should you so desire, Mr. Reeves of the Army Medical Museum,<lb/>
an accomplished photographer, will be glad to prepare for<lb/>
you a reproduction at the usual rates.</p>
