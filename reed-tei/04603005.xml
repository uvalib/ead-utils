Habana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Senorita Schumann:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Slowly recovering from the Christmas festivities into which I plunged on<lb/>
my return from Havana, I am now able to write to my Cuban friends who were<lb/>
so kind to me on my recent visit to Havana. Among them was your good self.<lb/>
I shall never forget your very real kindness to me and to the institutions<lb/>
which I represented. The flowers which you prepared for us were so magnificent<lb/>
and I know very well that you must have given them to me and to the institu-<lb/>
tions at a very special rate.</p>
<p>It was so thoughtful of you to spend the noon hour with Mr. Caswell and me<lb/>
translating my remarks into Spanish and then going to the special trouble<lb/>
of having such nice cards printed. I am very grateful also for the extra<lb/>
set of cards which you gave me. The day after the ceremony I went back to<lb/>
Campamento Lazear and took with my own camera photographs of all the flowers<lb/>
in place. I am now sending copies of these photographs to the institutions<lb/>
and organizations which presented the flowers. I know that they will be as<lb/>
grateful to you as I am for your outstanding <unclear>courtesy</unclear>.</p>
<p>My wife was simply delighted with the candles and candle holders. They were<lb/>
so lovely and festive. At first I had planned to put them under the tree<lb/>
for her to open Christmas morning as a Christmas present from you but then I<lb/>
decided that they were too lovely to save and that they should be opened be-<lb/>
fore Christmas and used to decorate our parlor. Mrs. Hench thought them very<lb/>
beautiful. They have attracted the admiring compliments of friends who have<lb/>
called. They are placed in our parlor on either side of a large mirror<lb/>
and look very nice indeed.</p>
<p>Because of your interest in the Camp Lazear dedication, permit me to send you<lb/>
a little article which will explain exactly what happened there. I hope you<lb/>
will be interested and amused in the description of how Mr. Moran, Mr. Pogolotti<lb/>
and I rediscovered the Camp in 1940 (see pages 3 to 7). I hope you can visit<lb/>
the camp some day. Mr. Caswell and I looked for you the morning of the dedica-<lb/>
tion and we had a seat reserved especially for you. I was sorry that you could<lb/>
not be there.</p>
<p>Because of your interest in cortisone as a result of your mother's use of it,<lb/>
permit me to send you also a reprint of the Nobel Festival for 1950, and it has<lb/>
been my pleasure to autograph it for you. I hope indeed that on my next trip<lb/>
to Havana Mrs. Hench will be with me as she and you would get along famously<lb/>

certainly call and pay our respects.</p>
