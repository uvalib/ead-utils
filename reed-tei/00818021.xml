<p>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA<lb/>
ISTHMIAN CANAL COMMISSION<lb/>
CANAL ZONE<lb/>
OFFICE OF DIRECTOR OF HOSPITALS<lb/>
Ancon, C.Z. <date value="1907-08-28">August 28th, 1907.</date>
(Rewritten Sept. 7th, 1907.)<lb/>
Colonel W. C. Gorgas,<lb/>
Chief Sanitary Officer,<lb/>
Ancon, Canal Zone.<lb/>
Sir:</p>
<p>The Board called by your Order of April 11th, 1907, G. O. #20,<lb/>
amended letter April 13th, copies enclosed, to investigate the matter of the<lb/>
prevalence of pneumonia on the Canal Zone <del>and</del> have the honor to submit the<lb/>
following report:</p>
<p>At the time this Board was called, pneumonia was widely prevalent<lb/>
over the Canal Zone, existing at practically every district therein, but<lb/>
varying very much as to the degree of its prevalence. For instance, in the<lb/>
preceding month, Tabernilla, with a population of <del>not</del> less than 700 colored,<lb/>
gave 31 cases; La Boca, with a population of over 800, gave one case. It<lb/>
was practically confined to the colored population.</p>
<p>Pneumonia began to show permanently in the morbidity and mortality<lb/>
statistics of the Isthmus about 15 months before and had almost from the<lb/>
beginning been most widely and most unequally diffused.</p>
<p><hi>THE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION</hi></p>
<p>It was determined:<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(A) To inspect the places where <unclear>phenmonia</unclear> was most prevalent, Taber-<lb/>
nilla and Gorgona Encampment; making a comparison between the houses where cases,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00818022"/>
<unclear>c</unclear> 2<lb/>
one or more than one had occurred, and the houses as close as possible, where<lb/>
no cases had occurred, to determine if there was any difference in the conditions<lb/>
of the houses themselves which could account for pneumonia developing in the one<lb/>
and not doing so in the other.</item>
<item>(B) To inspect the localities; comparing the houses and their environ-<lb/>
ments in stations where pneumonia was especially prevalent, with the conditions at<lb/>
stations where it was least prevalent to see if the conditions under which they<lb/>
were occupied, or in their environments could explain the differences of the<lb/>
prevalence of pneumonia in the different districts.</item>
<item>(C) To make an examination of the clinical records of pneumonia cases.</item>
<item>(D) To examine the records of pathological findings of pneumonia cases<lb/>
of the Ancon Hospital. The first two inquiries, (A) and (B), were to be conducted<lb/>
as far as possible by the full Board, or by as many members as possible, acting<lb/>
together; the third (C) by the Director of Hospitals; the fourth (D) by the<lb/>
Director of Labratory.</item>
</list></p>
<p>The causes which might influence the prevalence of pneumonia and the<lb/>
<add>were</add><lb/>
existence of each, where therefore made <unclear><del>with</del></unclear> the subject of this inquiry as follows:<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. Overcrowding or lack of ventilation.</item>
<item>2. Exposure to draft, i. e. <unclear>i<del>n</del><add>r</add>regular</unclear> or excessive ventilation.</item>
<item>3. Lack of sufficient bed covering.</item>
<item>4. Altitude; low lying places having wet grounds and being damp; high<lb/>
places having greater change of temperature between day and night.</item>
<item>5. The time of the year, wet or dry season.</item>
<item>6. Prevalence of malaria.</item>
<item>7. House infection; i. e. spreading from case to case in the same quarters.</item>
<item>8. Acclimatization, or length of residence on the Isthmus.</item>
</list></p>
<p>This last was taken up, (1) because upon even superficial examin-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00818023"/>
3<lb/>
ation of the statistics, it seemed apparent that an unduly large proportion were<lb/>
among those who had newly arrived, and (2) on account of an observation of<lb/>
Dr. Darling made in July of last year, in which he predicated that pneumonia in<lb/>
most instances was preceded by an influenza. Obviously such an <unclear>influenz<del>e</del><add>a</add></unclear>, which has<lb/>
been prevalent on the Isthmus for approximately two years, although by no means<lb/>
confined to the newly arrived, would be most general among them, and therefore<lb/>
accepting this observation as correct, pneumonia would be likewise. The patholog-<lb/>
ical record was especially to be examined with reference to the existence of in-<lb/>
flamation of the accessory sinuses in patients dead of pneumonia -- as per the<lb/>
report mentioned -- with control observations of sinusites in cases dead of other<lb/>
diseases.</p>
<p><hi>(A) INSPECTION OF HOUSES</hi></p>
<p>The in<del>f</del><add>sp</add>ection of the houses at Gorgona Encampment and Tabernilla, where<lb/>
the pneumonia was most prevalent, revealed no differences in regard to crowding,<lb/>
ventilation, cleanliness or amount of bed covering in the houses that had furnished<lb/>
no cases, from those in which cases, one or more than one, had developed.</p>
<p>The result of this inquiry was absolutely negative.</p>
<p><hi>(B) INSPECTION OF LOCALITIES.</hi></p>
<p>A comparison of <del>s</del><add>c</add>amps like those above named with those at La Boca and<lb/>
Gatun, both in low ground like Tabernilla, and Pedro Miguel<unclear>;</unclear> Paraiso<del>,</del> and Carthagen<del>t</del>a,<lb/>
all in high ground like the Encampment, revealed no differences in the above points,<lb/>
excepting a larger amount of bed covering. The camps at La Boca, the most crowded,<lb/>
furnished practically no cases of pneumonia. The camps at Paraiso and Carthagen<del>t</del>a,<lb/>
the least crowded, furnished also an extremely small number of cases. If anything,<lb/>
the camps at Tabernilla were in the best condition as regards cleanliness and general<lb/>
police, of any examined. The men in these camps, La Boca, Paraiso, Pedro Miguel and<lb/>
Carthagen<del>t</del>a stated that they were &ldquo;old men,&rdquo; that is they had been on the Isthmus for<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00818024"/>
4<lb/>
a considerable length of time. About forty or fifty were asked this question and<lb/>
all had been on the Isthmus a considerable time, not less than six or eight months;<lb/>
most of them claiming a year or more. The result of this examination was also nega-<lb/>
tive.</p>
<p>The examination of these places and houses was made with a considerable<lb/>
amount of pains and involved considerable work and time. I enclose a few samples<lb/>
of the records of the examinations made of the houses for the above investigations.</p>
<p><hi>(C) CLINICAL RECORD OF PNEUMONIA CASES.</hi></p>
<p>From the Specimen Record submitted herewith it is obvious that some of this<lb/>
data has to be obtained from the patient himself, it being simply impossible for<lb/>
the small number of District Physicians to make the personal examination<lb/>
for all the data that is required <add>of each patient</add>. It will be seen later that some of this data is<lb/>
unreliable.</p>
<p>From the data collected, the accompanying analyses are submitted and<lb/>
the following conclusions drawn:<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) Time of Year. Exhibit A.<lb/>
It will be seen that the pneymonia increased from the beginning of the<lb/>
dry season, being greatest towards its end; 124 cases in April, the driest month.<lb/>
Dropping down some in May and June, which are wetter months, but raising again in<lb/>
July, which was about as wet as June. It evidently was decidedly worse in the last<lb/>
dry season than in the wet season so far, July 31st. This is opposed to its general<lb/>
course last year. There was an increase of about ten or fifteen percent in the number<lb/>
of colored employees from January 1st to June 1st. Very few colored men arrived (and<lb/>
a number left) in October and November of 1906. The heavy importation of colored<lb/>
contract laborers began about January 14th and ceased May 16th, 1907. We do not<lb/>
find, then, any relation to season or time of year.</item>
<pb n="5" id="f00818025"/>
<item>5</item>
<item>(2) Locality. Ex. B.<lb/>
This table shows a great difference in the prevalence of pneumonia<lb/>
at different localities, but gives no light as to the cause of such differences.</item>
</list></p>
<p><hi>ALTITUDE</hi></p>
<p>150 cases per 1000 at Tabernilla with 30 at Christobal and 24 at La Boca, where the<lb/>
ground was equally low and approximately the same climatic conditions prevailing,<lb/>
except such as might be due to the presence of salt air. Gatun but little higher<lb/>
than Tabernilla gives 20 cases per thousand, and is in the same fresh water dis-<lb/>
trict. The Gorgona Encampment, an elevated place, gives a high percentage, while<lb/>
Cascadas, at near the same altitude and as far as one can tell, the same climatic<lb/>
conditions, gives the lowest on the list.</p>
<p><hi>RELATION TO MALARIA</hi></p>
<p>Gatun, Pedro Miguel and Tabernilla during this time were giving the<lb/>
largest percentage of malaria <add>of any places on the zone</add>. They gave 20, 20 and 150 per thousand cases<lb/>
of pneumonia respectively. There seems to be no relation then to altitude or<lb/>
prevalence of malaria.</p>
<p><hi>HOUSE INFECTION. Ex. C</hi>.</p>
<p>Of 205 houses identified as those in which pneumonia had occurred,<lb/>
in only 26 did more than a single case occur. There is no evidence then that it<lb/>
is spread by house infection.</p>
<p><hi>BED COVERING. Ex. D.</hi></p>
<p>Here we rely entirely upon the statement of the patients and we think<lb/>
little reliance can be placed in their statements upon this subject, as we find<lb/>
they call everything a blanket from a strip of cotton cloth to a gunny sack.</p>
<p>This exhibit would show that more than two-thirds of the cases had<lb/>
bed covering. As an examination of the camps where pneumonia was most prevalent,<lb/>
did not show a blanket in more than one bunk in three, this exhibit if it could be<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00818026"/>
-6-<lb/>
relied on would tend to show that the presence of bed covering induced to pneumonia.</p>
<p>(1) Balancing this against (1) the fact that the barracks where pneumonia<lb/>
were most prevalent showed decidedly less bed covering than in the places where<lb/>
pneumonia was less prevalent, and (2) the general experience elsewhere in the<lb/>
disease, we think no deductions should be drawn from this exhibit, and this table<lb/>
should be disregarded.</p>
<p><hi>DEFICIENT VENTILATION AND EXPOSURE TO DRAFT. Ex. E.</hi></p>
<p>It was attempted to get data on this by finding out if the patient had<lb/>
slept in the top bunk or not. This inquiry was not begun at the beginning and is,<lb/>
therefore, less extensive than is desirable. It is believed, however, to be fairly<lb/>
accurate becasue, while very generally the patient did not know the number of his<lb/>
house, yet, he seemed always to know whether he slept in the top bunk or not, and<lb/>
this seems reasonable.</p>
<p>The barracks are built with a louvre about three feet high, just under<lb/>
the eaves and just slightly above the top bunks, which run along the sides parallel<lb/>
and close to these louvres. It is obvious then that the men occupying the top<lb/>
bunks have (1) better ventilation and (2) are more exposed to draft than those<lb/>
occupying the other bunks. Obviously also there being three tiers of bunks one-<lb/>
third of the total number are top bunks. In point of fact less than one-third of<lb/>
the number in barracks sleep in the top bunks, because if the barrack is not en-<lb/>
tirely full (which, however, is not usually the case) the top bunk is empty as<lb/>
it requires more climbing to get to it than the others. If, then, lack of venti-<lb/>
lation has been a predisposing cause, there should be decidedly less than one-third<lb/>
of the total number of cases of pneumonia in the top bunk. If, however, exposure<lb/>
to draft has <del>not</del> been such a cause, there should be over one-third <unclear><del>of the top bunk men<lb/>
men</del></unclear> in the pneumonia list <unclear><add>of top bunk men</add></unclear> <add>of the bunk men</add>. In point of fact the ratio - 52 to 162 - is slightly<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f00818027"/>
7<lb/>
under one-third, about the ratio of the men occupying the top bunk to the whole<lb/>
number. This subject, then, does not show that deficient ventilation due to<lb/>
sleeping in the lower bunks, or exposure to draft due to sleeping in the top<lb/>
bunks, in any wise affected the prevalence of pneumonia.</p>
<p><hi>Ex. E and F<lb/>
Close or Open Quarters.</hi></p>
<p>No deductions will be drawn as the data is regarded as utterly unreliable.</p>
<p>Similarly no deduction is drawn from Ex. G, as the data collected is not<lb/>
sufficient. This data, however, is believed to be reliable, and as far as it goes<lb/>
gives a negative finding; i. e. bunk most exposed to the draft when the door is<lb/>
opened did not affect the percentage of pneumonia.</p>
<p><hi>Exhibit H</hi></p>
<p>This exhibit shows:</p>
<p>(1) The number of &ldquo;new men&rdquo; (men not over three months on the Isthmus) and<lb/>
&ldquo;old men&rdquo; (men over three months on the Isthmus) among the colored employes of the<lb/>
Commission at the commencement of each month, - also the number of cases of pneumonia<lb/>
in each of the above classes during each month, with the ratio of the number of &ldquo;new<lb/>
men&rdquo; to the number of &ldquo;old men&rdquo; on the pay-roll and the number of cases among the<lb/>
&ldquo;new&rdquo; to the number of cases to the &ldquo;old men&rdquo; and the ratio of these ratios. Ob-<lb/>
viously if both classes of men in the above are equally liable to pneumonia, the<lb/>
ratio of the ratios should be 1; if the &ldquo;old men&rdquo; are more liable to pneumonia the<lb/>
ratio should be less than 1; if on the other hand, the &ldquo;new men&rdquo; are more liable,<lb/>
the ratio should be greater than 1.</p>
<p>An examination of this exhibit shows that in every month the ratio is<lb/>
greater than 1, decidedly so.</p>
<p>The conclusions to be drawn from the exhibit are that residence on the<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f00818028"/>
8<lb/>
Isthmus for over three months does give a decided protection against pneumonia.<lb/>
This is the only positive finding given by this investigation, i. e. examination<lb/>
of the clinical records.</p>
<p>There are several differential conditions between the &ldquo;old&rdquo; and the<lb/>
&ldquo;new&rdquo; men which may be factors.<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) The newly arrived man does not know how to care for himself so well<lb/>
as the older resident. The complete change in his life and habits must, to some<lb/>
extent, have a perturbating effect on his health, and thus would be apt to pre-<lb/>
dispose to any kind of disease prevailing.</item>
<item>(2) He is also a blanketless man. The examination of the camps show<lb/>
generally a much larger proportion of blankets, and other <unclear>bed</unclear> covering, in the<lb/>
camps of the older residents than in those of the newly arrived.</item>
<item>(3) There is, and for nearly two years has been, prevailing on the Isthmus<lb/>
an infectious catarrhl inflammation of the respiratory tract, especially the upper<lb/>
part of it. This occurs, we suppose recurs, among a certain proportion of the older<lb/>
residents, but it is extremely prevalent among the newly arrived men. This has<lb/>
been noted by all the District Physicians for the past 18 or 20 months and was to<lb/>
be expected; as such a disease would naturally produce a temporary immunity.</item>
</list></p>
<p>All of the above may well be factors.</p>
<p><hi>(D) EXAMINATION OF RECORD OF PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS OF PNEUMONIA CASES.</hi></p>
<p>Attention is now invited to the accompanying paper from the Director of<lb/>
the Labratory (Ex. I), which shows (1) that there is a large number of purulent<lb/>
sinusites -- a condition which in the United States would usually be considered the<lb/>
result of a recent Influenza -- among the autopsies of colored patients dead from<lb/>
other than pneumococcus infection -- 17%. (2) That among autopsies of patients dead<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f00818029"/>
9<lb/>
of Pneumococcus infection the proportion of such sinusites is very much larger -- 61%.<lb/>
these sinusites being pneumococcus infections.</p>
<p>There is, thus, good evidence of a connection between the purulent pneumococcus<lb/>
sinusites and the pneumococcus infection of other organs, either (a) directly casual,<lb/>
or (b) both the result of a common cause. His statement of July, 1906 that the age<lb/>
of the sinus infection &ldquo;is appreciably greater than that of the lung or meningeal<lb/>
lesion&rdquo; is to be noted and would naturally lead to his conclusion in the last para-<lb/>
graph that &ldquo;the portal of entry of the Pneumococcus is in most instances an inflamed<lb/>
accessory nasal sinus the mucuous membrane of which is fitted for the reception of<lb/>
the pneumococcus by an antecedent influenze or rhinitis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Darling states verbally that in the autopsies of those dead of<lb/>
pneumococcus infection that there were also a considerable number of pneumococcus<lb/>
inflamations of the sinuses not purulent. The ratio of pneumococcus sinusites,<lb/>
purulent and nonpurulent, in autopsies of those dead of pneumonia infection is<lb/>
then decidedly greater than 61%.</p>
<p>There is no reason why such a sinus, inflamed but not purulent, should<lb/>
not be an antrum of entrance for the organism, as well as a purulent one, and the<lb/>
probability of some such casual relation between them, direct or indirect, is very<lb/>
great and to your Board convincing.</p>
<p>Correlating the findings of the Pathelogist with the one positive conclu-<lb/>
sion reached by examination of the clinical record, i. e. that the newly arrived men<lb/>
are far more susceptible to pneumonia than the older residents, we believe this in-<lb/>
creased susceptibility is due mainly to the greater prevalence of this infections<lb/>
catarrh (influenza) among the newly arrived, although this would naturally be ac-<lb/>
centuated by the other two factors mentioned on page No. 8 -- lack of blankets and<lb/>
ignorance of caring for themselves. With this correlation this opinion is so<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f00818030"/>
10<lb/>
strongly confirmed that we accept the role of the prevailing infectious catarrh<lb/>
of the upper respiratory tract as the prime factor in predisposing to pneumonia<lb/>
(Pneumococcus infection) predicated by Dr. Darling in his report of July 1906<lb/>
unreservedly.</p>
<p>To sum up your Board cannot find that the prevalence of Pneumonia is<lb/>
affected by:<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) The time of year.</item>
<item>(2) The altitude. Tabernilla - about 12' above sea level and abso-<lb/>
lutely flat, and Gorgona Encampment, about 105' high and well drained, gave the<lb/>
highest proportion of cases, while Cristobal, La Boca and Corozal, all comparable<lb/>
with the first, and Las Cascadas, Pedro Miguel and Paraiso, comparable with the<lb/>
second, gave low percentages.</item>
<item>(3) The prevalence of Malaria.</item>
<item>(4) House infection - by previous case.</item>
<item>(5) Deficient ventilation and over-crowding, as they exist in<lb/>
Commission Quarters.</item>
<item>(6) Exposure to draft - as it exists in Commission Quarters.</item>
</list></p>
<p>That it is decidedly more prevalent in men newly arrived -- under three<lb/>
months -- than in older residents. 4 1/2 times as <unclear>prevalent</unclear></p>
<p>That it is mainly due to the presence on the Isthmus of an infectious<lb/>
catarrh, which naturally is especially prevalent among the new arrivals, and which<lb/>
predisposes them to pneumonia.</p>
<p>That the process is generally the production of an inflamation of the<lb/>
accessory sinuses -- due to the catarrh -- the <unclear>muccus</unclear> membrane of which is thus<lb/>
fitted for the reception and growth of the pneumococcus, and this serves as the<lb/>
atrium of entrance for that organism.</p>
<pb n="11" id="f00818031"/>
<p>11</p>
<p>Since we can do nothing to prevent the employe contracting this catarrh<lb/>
we must do what is possible to render its course, and hence its effects milder:<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) That the role of the infectious catarrh prevalent on the Isthmus<lb/>
in the cauzation of pneumonia be clearly recognized, and that therefore it be<lb/>
treated by the District Physicians with that knowledge before them and considered<lb/>
as a graver disease than it has hitherto been.</item>
<item><p>(2) That as far as possible the newly arrived colored laborers be<lb/>
grouped at places where Drying Houses are located, so that clothes and bedding<lb/>
may be rapidly dried.</p>
<p>Indeed the general introduction of Drying Houses would, we believe,<lb/>
render the catarrhal symptoms of this infection less severe, and therefore less<lb/>
likely to lead to pneumonia.</p></item>
<item>(3) That a blanket and a piece of matting or canvas, or two blankets<lb/>
be issued to the colored man on his arrival, unless he has sufficient bed covering,<lb/>
and charged to his account.</item>
</list></p>
<p>Two coverings are advised because it is advisable to put some fabric<lb/>
between the cloth of the bunk and the man. The piece of matting is better (warmer)<lb/>
than the canvas, and has been used to cover canvas cots with great advantage by the<lb/>
Hospital Division. Naturally either is cheaper, and less good, than a second blanket.</p>
<p>No loss will be caused to the laborer by making him take a blanket. In<lb/>
general he buys one about the third or fourth month, paying more for it than he would<lb/>
for one from the Commissary, <del>and</del> which he would have at the most critical time, for<lb/>
him, on the Isthmus.</p>
<p>A few bunks have bottoms of metal strips, and no cloth. These especially<lb/>
ought to be covered by some non-conducting fabric.</p>

<p>July 1906.</p>
<p>The pathologist of Ancon Hospital reports the following deductions from<lb/>
investigations of cases of pneumococcus infection:</p>
<p>"Having noticed for some time a coincident inflammation of the accessary<lb/>
nasal sinuses with acute cerebro-spinal pneumococcus meningitis, it occurred to me<lb/>
to investigate the relation of these sinuses to pneumococcus infections.</p>
<p>"Up to July 21, 1906, the accessary nasal sinuses had been examined<lb/>
with regard to this point in 52 autopsies, 37 of which were pneumococcus infections<lb/>
as follows: Lobar pneumonia 22, acute pericarditis 1, acute meningitis 9, septicaemia<lb/>
5, remaining 15 were controls. It is found that 92 per cent of all pneumococcus<lb/>
infections coming to autopsy show to a very marked degree more or less typical<lb/>
<pb n="21" id="f00818042"/>
pneumococcus inflammation of one or more of the accessary nasal sinuses.<lb/>
The inflammation is generally intense; it is fibrino purulent in character,<lb/>
fibrin and mononuclear cells being abundant. Pneumococci are always present<lb/>
and in number depending upon the duration of the process.</p>
<p>"A point of great importance is the age of the sinus affection, which<lb/>
is appreciable greater than that of the lung or meningeal lesion.</p>
<p>"Ninety-one per cent of the pneumonia cases showed a sinusitis. One<lb/>
hundred per cent of the cases of simple meningitis presented an inflammation of<lb/>
one or more of the sinuses, and in every one the middle ears and mastoid cells<lb/>
were normal.</p>
<p>"The case of &lsquo;primary&rsquo; pneumococcus pericarditis is of interest because<lb/>
all the sinuses were involved, yet the meninges were normal, and the lungs contained<lb/>
only small patches of broncho-pneumonia.</p>
<p>"In the pneumococcus septicaemia group 80 per cent were found to be<lb/>
associated with a sinusitis. The controls were all other than pneumococcus infec-<lb/>
tions just as they came to autopsy, and of these 20 per cent had an acute inflamma-<lb/>
tion of at least one of the sinuses.</p>
<p>"It has been observed that acute sinusitis of the maxillary, sphenoidal<lb/>
and frontal sinuses, and acute ethmoiditis of the posterior ethmoidal cells is<lb/>
common among negro laborers of recent (one to five months) arrival from Barbadoes<lb/>
and the smaller islands. The fatal pneumococcus infections similarly are among<lb/>
that class.</p>
<p>"It is thought that the portal of entry of the pneymococcus is in most<lb/>
instances an inflamed accessary nasal sinus, the mucous membrane of which is fitted<lb/>
for the reception of the pneumococcus by an antecedent influenza or rhinitis.</p>
