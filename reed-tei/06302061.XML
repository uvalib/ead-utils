<salute>My dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>Are you quite ready to give me<lb/>
up as a hopeless correspondent?<lb/>
If so I would not blame you in<lb/>
the least. I have no one to beat<lb/>
the type writer for me and have<lb/>
had a great deal of writing to do<lb/>
in the part three months. You<lb/>
know what the demand of our<lb/>
friend Hench can be when he is<lb/>
hot on the trail and have had<lb/>
several other irons in the fire.<lb/>
The Thos. Jefferson memorial has<lb/>
got to a point where I could do<lb/>
something and I have been the<lb/>
working member of the Committee on<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06302062"/>
2<lb/>
inscription, and it is surprising<lb/>
how far afield that has taken me.<lb/>
For one item I have read all of<lb/>
Abraham Lincoln's speeches in<lb/>
his contest with Douglass in 1859<lb/>
-60 and I wish I had read them<lb/>
fifty years ago. I wanted to see<lb/>
just what connection there was between<lb/>
Jefferson's abolition activities has<lb/>
with Lincolns. T. J. began to attack<lb/>
the slave trade before the Revolution<lb/>
and finally secured its prohibition<lb/>
when he was President in 1808.<lb/>
He was determined to limit the<lb/>
spread of slavery to the Mississippi<lb/>
Valley and in the old continental<lb/>
Congress just missed having it pro-<lb/>
hibited in Alabama Mississippi Tenna-<lb/>
see &amp; Kentucky by one vote. The law<lb/>
which prohibited it in the Northwest<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06302063"/>
<hi>3</hi>.<lb/>
Territory which Virginia gave to the<lb/>
union to be made into five states was<lb/>
drawn up by him but did not pass<lb/>
until after he left the Congress to be<lb/>
our minister to France, but Lincoln<lb/>
gave him the credit for it. It was<lb/>
the effort of Douglass to repeal this<lb/>
law which brought on his contest<lb/>
with Lincoln. The commission seem<lb/>
averse to having any mention made<lb/>
of this life-long warfare against<lb/>
slavery on the part of Jefferson<lb/>
but I cannot see why. Then Dr.<lb/>
Francisco Dominguez has sent me his<lb/>
book 300 pages of excellent French printed<lb/>
in Paris to show that Dr. Carlos Finlay<lb/>
was the whole cheese and that Walter<lb/>
Reed only verified facts which Finlay<lb/>
had already proved experimentally.<lb/>
But he does not explain - none of them<lb/>
do - why it was that neither he nor<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06302064"/>
C<hi rend="subscript">2</hi><lb/>
B<hi rend="subscript">5</hi><lb/>
4.<lb/>
any of the doctors in Havana or elsewhere<lb/>
accepted the discovery until Reed &amp; his<lb/>
assistants came along and demonstrated<lb/>
it so that in the words of Goldberger<lb/>
of the Public Health Service Reed &ldquo;<hi>converted<lb/>
a discredited hypothesis into an established<lb/>
doctrine</hi>&rdquo;. There is the crux of the matter<lb/>
in 8 words. I am willing to agree that<lb/>
Dr. Finlay <hi>discovered</hi> the r&ocirc;le of the<lb/>
mosquito and Major Reed <hi>demonstrated</hi><lb/>
it. They dont say anything about<lb/>
the infected clothing experiment which<lb/>
was of such far reaching importance<lb/>
yet even Gorgas did not accept that<lb/>
until August 1901 and in spite of<lb/>
the Dept. Order to do so did not stop<lb/>
the disinfection of bedding &amp; clothing<lb/>
until Aug 15 1901. I am very curi-<lb/>
ous to hear from Dr. Hench how he is<lb/>
getting along with them. Well I have<lb/>
had quite a correspondence with Dr.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06302065"/>

Apr 10, 1941<lb/>
2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
GEORGETOWN<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
Dominquez &amp; my old friend &amp; neighbor<lb/>
Dr. Angles in Quemados about<lb/>
some of the current mis-statements<lb/>
in Dr. D's, book. He has a very good<lb/>
photograph of Schuler's bust of Reed<lb/>
with the statement under it that the<lb/>
inscription is<lb/>
Walter Reed<lb/>
1851 - 1902<lb/>
Surgeon (Major) U. S. Army</p>
<p>&ldquo; President of the Board of Army Medical Officers that<lb/>
discovered and demonstrated in 1901 the transmis-<lb/>
sion of yellow fever by mosquitoes (Since 1921 at<lb/>
the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.&rdquo;<lb/>
I think it was in 1934 that you moved this bust<lb/>
out to Walter Reed Hospital where it properly<lb/>
belongs - so I got Ireland to phone out there<lb/>
and find out what was in fact the in-<lb/>
scription under it. The answer was simply<lb/>
his name <hi>Walter Reed</hi> and no more.<lb/>
Then I phoned to the Army Medical Museum<lb/>
where they have a replica of it in bronze<lb/>
also by Schuler. The reply was there was no<lb/>
inscription - not even his name.<lb/>
There I phoned to the National Museum (not of Art.)<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06302066"/>
6<lb/>
and after much research they found in<lb/>
their files a photograph of the bust and<lb/>
a copy of the inscription, for which the<lb/>
Assistant Curator, Mr. Whitefread hastened<lb/>
to say that the Historical Section was<lb/>
responsible, which was about as Dr<lb/>
Dominguez had stated. But I could<lb/>
assume his that it had been removed<lb/>
before his book was printed. Angle's<lb/>
had written me that the inscription with the<lb/>
objectionable word &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; in it was<lb/>
in the National Capital. So much for<lb/>
that. Well I finally rounded up<lb/>
Ireland one morning when he had nothing<lb/>
on his mind and we read the entire<lb/>
correspondence that you sent me about<lb/>
Carroll and Agramonte. He said he<lb/>
didnt know any thing about it but what<lb/>
you and I told him. I said that his func-<lb/>
tion was not to give information but to<lb/>
he the jury to hear the facts and give<lb/>
a finding. So after he had considered<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06302067"/>
7.<lb/>
the evidence he said that he did not<lb/>
think it was of any great importance<lb/>
to decide whether Agramonte really<lb/>
did take care of the mosquitoes or only<lb/>
thought he did, or whether he really was<lb/>
present when Lazear put the mosquito<lb/>
on Dean, which you and I very much<lb/>
doubt. His feeling is, and I agree with him<lb/>
that it is a pity to bring discredit after all<lb/>
these years on these men that are dead<lb/>
for differences of statement in details<lb/>
that are of no great importance.<lb/>
Let us help Dr. Hench all we can in his<lb/>
efforts to get to the bottom of things but<lb/>
not to do any much raking. And I<lb/>
am inclined to let the Cubans have Dr<lb/>
Finlay as the discoverer, as he was, altho<lb/>
we may have our doubts about his<lb/>
very wild cases of yellow fever caused<lb/>
by unripe mosquitoes. Reed is secure<lb/>
in his fame. He did what he set out<lb/>
to do and all the world knows it. Now<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06302068"/>
C<hi rend="subscript">2</hi><lb/>
B<hi rend="subscript">5</hi><lb/>
8<lb/>
when men who pose as historians like<lb/>
Burton J. Hendrick, and he has written<lb/>
some valuable books, try to robe Reed<lb/>
of some of his glory to give it to Gorgas<lb/>
who dont need it and who reaped<lb/>
all the financial and other rewards<lb/>
then I say lets put up a fight and<lb/>
let the truth be known. Gorgas<lb/>
never made any such claims and<lb/>
we wont let any one else make them.</p>
<p>In the nice letter that you wrote<lb/>
me at Christmas you ask if Mrs Ames<lb/>
ever got her bill through. I dont<lb/>
think she did. Love promised to<lb/>
let me know if she or Lambert or<lb/>
any of the other claimants got by &amp;<lb/>
he never has. Old Senator Sheppard<lb/>
who was Chairman of the Senate Military<lb/>
Committee was her long suit and got<lb/>
a favorable report from his committee<lb/>
but he died yesterday &amp; I hope the<lb/>

Apr 10, 1941<lb/>
bill will die with him.</p>
<p>2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
GEORGETOWN<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.</p>
<p>I had a postal from Dr Hench from<lb/>
Havana this apt. signed by him and<lb/>
by Moran. I had written to him there<lb/>
and, <hi>inter alia</hi>, I mentioned that I<lb/>
had never received the photo copies<lb/>
of the Hemmeter-Carroll Correspondence<lb/>
that he said he had mailed me.<lb/>
In this postal he explains that<lb/>
he sent that to you and you<lb/>
were to read it and send it to<lb/>
me at your convenience. So now<lb/>
I feel better and have just poured<lb/>
out a drink, it being 5-<hi rend="superscript">30</hi> <unclear>max</unclear><lb/>
Herbert Slocum used to say. First<lb/>
drink time and will drink to your<lb/>
health and that of the dear lady who<lb/>
is your wife, and when I have second<lb/>
I will drink success to little King Peter II<lb/>
of Serbia who certainly needs all the good<lb/>

him. Cornelia Kean joins me in<lb/>
good wishes to you both and I am</p>

P.S. This is a long letter and I am not<lb/>
going to read it over. If I have written<lb/>
the wrong letter or spelled any word<lb/>
differently from the way my 10 volume<lb/>
Century Dictionary does just re-<lb/>
member that I will be 81 in June<lb/>
and overlook it.<lb/>
