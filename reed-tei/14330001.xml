<salute>Dear Mother.</salute>
</opener>
<p>One of our boxes<lb/>
arrived on the transport<lb/>
and the other we<lb/>
are bothering the ex-<lb/>
press people about. I<lb/>
wish Helen had thought<lb/>
to send me the receipt,<lb/>
but I guess it will<lb/>
turn up all right, after<lb/>
a while. The books are<lb/>
lovely, and I was very<lb/>
glad to get my pic-<lb/>
ture frames, they help<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14330002"/>
out the &ldquo;garnishing&rdquo; of<lb/>
my parlor very much.<lb/>
Please ask Helen what<lb/>
she did about Mrs.<lb/>
Stark's hat, she did<lb/>
not mention it in<lb/>
her letter.</p>
<p>Yesterday I drove in to<lb/>
see Gertrude. Miss Shaw<lb/>
and Murray were out<lb/>
but I had a nice visit<lb/>
with Gertrude. She was<lb/>
very affectionate and<lb/>
all dangerous subjects<lb/>
were carefully avoided.<lb/>
She seemed to be cheer-<lb/>
ful, tho' I heard from<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14330003"/>
people who came down on the trans-<lb/>
port, that she was very nervous<lb/>
and very much depressed. As Madam<lb/>
Misery is going to Morristown after<lb/>
Xmas I infer that Bessie has not<lb/>
insisted on the annual visit.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed has now three cases of<lb/>
fever from mosquitoe bites, while<lb/>
the men who have been sleeping<lb/>
on infected bedding for twelve days<lb/>
are getting fat. The yellow fever<lb/>
board says there is no doubt that<lb/>
the cases are genuine, and there is<lb/>
likewise no doubt that the men<lb/>
were infected by &ldquo;loaded&rdquo; mosquitoes.<lb/>
Isn't it wonderful, you can hardly<lb/>
realize how much this discovery means<lb/>
to Cuba and the South, not to<lb/>
speak of the saving of clothes etc.<lb/>
for, of course, disinfection is perfect<lb/>
rot now the mosquitoe theory is<lb/>
established. I wish you could hear<lb/>
Dr. Reed on the subject, he is so en-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14330004"/>
tertaining and so<lb/>
funny. Always threaten-<lb/>
ing to go off on a<lb/>
toot, but always with<lb/>
a good reason as to<lb/>
why the toot should<lb/>
be put off until next<lb/>
week.</p>
<p>Mama seems to be<lb/>
improving, tho' she is<lb/>
still very weak and<lb/>
suffers some from <del>the</del><lb/>
<unclear>siatica</unclear>. She had a<lb/>
very nice trip down, and<lb/>
she was so pleased<lb/>
at the way father<lb/>
and Mase and Caz waited<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14330005"/>
on her in New York. I<lb/>
gave her your messages,<lb/>
and she said she was<lb/>
very sorry not to see<lb/>
you, but it was such<lb/>
a bad day she was<lb/>
glad you did not make<lb/>
the trip to the city. Mama<lb/>
is just as much pleased<lb/>
with Cuba as you were,<lb/>
but she is not strong<lb/>
enough to take very<lb/>
long drives yet.</p>
<p>I have been so busy<lb/>
since I moved up here<lb/>
that Martha's lessons<lb/>
fell into innocuous<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14330006"/>
desuitude, but Mama has revived<lb/>
them and she and Martha have<lb/>
quite a <unclear>seance</unclear> every morning. Of<lb/>
course she is Bobbie's devoted slave,<lb/>
just as the rest of us are.</p>
<p>I am awfully glad Peg had such<lb/>
a five time in Philadelphia. I<lb/>
enjoyed her letter Helen sent me<lb/>
very much.</p>
<p>Rannie and I bought a very pretty<lb/>
old silver dish for the <unclear>McCarrolls</unclear> to-<lb/>
day. It is round, six inches across<lb/>
and weighs eleven ounces, so it is<lb/>
handsome and heavy. I hope they<lb/>
will like it, and will have sense<lb/>
enough to see it is old and hand<lb/>
made. I did not have it marked for<lb/>
they do such things so badly here.</p>
<p>Love to all</p>
<closer>
<salute>most lovingly</salute>
