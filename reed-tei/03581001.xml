<salute>My dear Mr. Tisdel:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Two years ago, I requested a copy of Senate Document Vol 61,<lb/>
Number 822, 61st Congress, Third Session, Report of the Yellow Fever Commission.<lb/>
This I did very blithely, not realizing how rare that volume was. You very<lb/>
kindly located a copy of this from Mrs. Kidwell (your correspondence of<lb/>
August 9, and August 17, 1937). I can assure you that I have used this<lb/>
volume long and well. Originally, I wanted it in connection with the<lb/>
preparation of an address to be given at Washington and Jefferson College,<lb/>
Washington, Pennsylvania this Fall, on the occasion of the dedication of a<lb/>
Lazear Memorial Building, at which time I will present a paper on the conquest<lb/>
of yellow fever. Since then, I have become greatly interested in this story.<lb/>
I have visited Kissinger in Huntington, Indiana, and Moran in Havana, two<lb/>
privates who were the first to volunteer to Walter Reed as subjects for experi-<lb/>
mental yellow fever. I have also visited General Kean in Washington, and have<lb/>
had considerable correspondence with General Truby as well as visiting Miss<lb/>
Agramonte, the daughter of Dr. Agramonte, one of Walter Reed's colleagues.</p>
<p>On my recent visit to Cuba, I found that the government had lost<lb/>
track of Camp Lazear and had erroneously identified another site where they are<lb/>
preparing to build a memorial for which already two hundred thousand dollars<lb/>
have been collected. I was able to find the true site and prove that the site<lb/>
now selected is wrong. This was only possible by my intimate knowledge of the<lb/>
Senate Document which you so kindly sent me. The Cuban government has asked<lb/>
me to send them documentary evidence, etc. so that they may relocate the proper<lb/>
site. In connection with this report to them, and in my forthcoming talk at<lb/>
Washington and Jefferson College, I am most anxious to obtain several more<lb/>
governmental documents, and would appreciate greatly your help in this matter.<lb/>
They are as follows:<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>exhausted 1. The Surgeon General's Report for 1901 (I should like four or five<lb/>
copies if they are available.</item>
<item>exhausted 2. <hi>Senate Report No. 574, 61st Congress, Second Session</hi> (referred to<lb/>
on page 30 of Senate Document No. 822). or in Serial 5589</item>
<item>exhausted 61-2 3. Bill S 7252. <unclear>Exh</unclear></item>
<item>4. Senate <hi>Report No. 210</hi>. 61-2 or serial 5588</item>
<item>exhausted 1-2 5. S 4479 (I imagine that this is a Senate Bill). <unclear>Exh.</unclear> NR 6272 <unclear>sub see next<lb/>
page</unclear></item>
<item>These items 3, 4, and 5 are all referred to on p. 30 of Senate Document 822,<lb/>
Volume 61. Unfortunately, I cannot give you a more detailed reference, as that is<lb/>
the way they are referred to.<lb/>

<pb n="2" id="f03581002"/>
<item>- 2 -</item>
<item>61-2: Pri. 82</item>
<item>exhausted</item>
<item>6. Senate Bill 6272, passed by the Senate Feb. 15, 1910 (referred<lb/>
to on page 27 of Senate Document No. 822, Volume 61.</item>
<item>7. <hi>Senate Document No. 10, 59th Congress, Second</hi> Session.</item>
<item>exhausted</item>
<item>or Serial 5069</item>
</list></p>
<p>I shall of course be delighted to pay whatever expense is involved<lb/>
in obtaining these documents, and I am anxious to know whether you have an index<lb/>
listing other documents referring to Walter Reed and the yellow fever experiments<lb/>
or the volunteers of these experiments.</p>
<p>61-3 If there is any possibility of obtaining one or two more copies of<lb/>
Senate Document 822, I shall, of course, be delighted to have them, and I wonder<lb/>
if you know of any second-hand book store in Washington which might specialize<lb/>
in old governmental publications that might not be available in your office.</p>
