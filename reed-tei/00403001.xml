<salute>My very dear Friend.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter has<lb/>
just reached me. I was so interested<lb/>
to hear about your little visit with<lb/>
Nell. It is such a comfort and joy<lb/>
to me to know that you can see<lb/>
each other, and your letters are always<lb/>
so interesting-</p>
<p>Dear little Houston often speaks of<lb/>
Baltimore ganny. Mabel bought some<lb/>
of the toasted bread. (I don't know how<lb/>
to spell the German name? and he<lb/>
said Baltimore ganny bought me<lb/>
some like that. It was some little<lb/>
time you remembere<del>d</del>? so you see<lb/>
he does not forget anything<lb/>
Last night he said. When we go to<lb/>
Baltimore <hi>Christine</hi> (the nurse) can't<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00403002"/>
go with us and I said who will take<lb/>
care of baba on the train.<lb/>
dis ganny, and Mama will<lb/>
take care of Huse.</p>
<p>I wish you could hear him say<lb/>
Houston Lazear - it is so cute,<lb/>
And little Peggy running around<lb/>
with her creeper on, she always<lb/>
calls me &ldquo;<unclear>Darmiss</unclear>&rdquo;. and says<lb/>
Gad bye to  everyone-</p>
<p>Mabel is still occupied with<lb/>
her business letters. she received<lb/>
such a nice letter from<lb/>
<del>Governor</del><add>General</add> Wood of Havana- he also<lb/>
inclosed a copy of one he had<lb/>
written to Mr Dalzell which was<lb/>
certainly a most loving tribute to Jesse,<lb/>
and explaining matters in references to<lb/>
Jesse's work better than any one<lb/>
else could have done-</p>
<p>I was so sorry to know you had<lb/>
not received your box. Have you<lb/>
the bill of layding</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00403003"/>
<p>The little blue nighty came yesterday, as soon as arrived<lb/>
it was delivered to Houston to unwrap. he was delighted<lb/>
with it, and if he were awake as I write I have no doubt<lb/>
would express his thanks - Sometimes I ask him what I<lb/>
shall say to Ganny, and says <del>witte</del>- &ldquo;write me a<lb/>
letter&rdquo;- Mabel &amp; I sometimes talk of the East, and think if<lb/>
our lives are spared, we would wish to go sometimes<lb/>
before we would be obliged to pay any fare for the<lb/>
babies- I think it so strange about your box? We will<lb/>
enquire at this end of the route - Thus far we <unclear>are have</unclear><lb/>
no rain this Winter, and the dry weather brings colds.<lb/>
I have been staying in town for a few days trying to get <del><unclear></unclear></del><lb/>
rid of mine. Pardon brevity this time.</p>
<p>Please remember me to Mrs Seth &amp; family<lb/>
With love &amp; best wishes to your own dear self</p>

In Jennie's Christmas letter<lb/>
she said there was a lovely<lb/>
article in the &ldquo;Boston Transcript&rdquo;<lb/>
about the memorial for Jesse.<lb/>
It was written by, President Eliott<lb/>
of Harvard. although Jennie did<lb/>
not know who had written it,<lb/>
at this time she read it-<lb/>
Dr Paton wrote Mabel they had<lb/>
already collected twenty four hundred<lb/>
dollars!<lb/>
Jennie writes they had their Christmas<lb/>
dinner at <unclear>Walter's</unclear> father, house<lb/>
Mrs Kilham dressed two dolls in<lb/>
dark blue - and presented them to<lb/>
Jeannette &amp; Teresa- but they<lb/>
positively refused to take them<lb/>
Jennie tried to put them in<lb/>
a package but Jeannette would<lb/>
have none of it - And Teresa<lb/>
refused to carry her's. she said &ldquo;I<lb/>
might lose it on the way&rdquo;<lb/>
It must have been rather<lb/>
embarasing to Jennie?<lb/>
