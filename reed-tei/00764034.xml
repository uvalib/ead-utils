YELLOW FEVER BUREAU,<lb/>
UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Carter,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Many thanks for your letter of January 25th.</p>
<p>I shall be very glad indeed if you will send me the epi-<lb/>
demiological data which you mention. It<del>n</del> is quite true as you say<lb/>
that experiments are often more satisfactory than observation, but in<lb/>
this particular case they would have to be somewhat numerous, a consi-<lb/>
derable inconvenience in the case of human experiments. In this, as in<lb/>
many other respects, it would be of the greatest possible importance<lb/>
if we could always use animal experiments instead. I and several other<lb/>
investigators are of opinion that we have produced yellow fever in<lb/>
guinea-pigs and I have recently proposed an experiment in order to<lb/>
decide whether our animals have really been infected with yellow fever.<lb/>
I enclose a recently published note of mine, in which I state the<lb/>
broad outlines of this experiment as I think it should be done.<lb/>
(As I have received no reprints of this paper, I prefer to send you<lb/>
at once, instead of waiting, a copy of the Journ. Trop. Med. in which<lb/>
the paper appeared. I am sending this under separate cover together<lb/>
with a few reprints of other papers.)</p>
<p>I have put this proposal before the Yellow Fever Commission,<lb/>
but they have declined it as they are not authorized to undertake<lb/>
human experiments. It appears to me that it ought not to be difficult<lb/>
to find volunteers for this experiment considering that several people<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00764035"/>
2<lb/>
feel so very certain that I am mistaken. Should the experiment, however,<lb/>
prove that I am right then we should not only be able to solve the<lb/>
question of carriers and of mild infections, but we should in all<lb/>
probability soon possess an effective personal prophylaxis against<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>If you consider the matter worth while, I suppose you would<lb/>
succeed in getting your Public Hea<add>l</add>th Service to undertake the experi-<lb/>
ments, in which case I should of course be glad if they would make<lb/>
use of my services, but also otherwise I should be glad to discuss<lb/>
with you in further detail how the experiments should be conducted.<lb/>
In order to obtain conclusive results, it would be advisable to<lb/>
have the matter fully discussed before starting work.</p>
<p>The full reports of work<del>s</del> done in West Africa will soon<lb/>
appear and I suppose the Commission will send you a personal copy.</p>
<p>I trust you are quite well by now and send you my best wishes<lb/>
for a complete recovery from that very disagreeable disease.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours sincerely</salute>
