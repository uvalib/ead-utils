<p><hi>The Finca San Jose</hi></p>
<p>The Pedroso family is one of the oldest and most illustrious in<lb/>
Cuba. During the entire (Spanish) Colonial period of Cuba<lb/>
members of the Pedroso family held high positions in the social<lb/>
and political life of Havana. The manorial &ldquo;Pedroso<lb/>
Palace&rdquo; which faces the waterfront (address:<lb/>
<unclear>de Pedroso y Florencia</unclear>) was built in 1770 by Don Matheo<lb/>
de Pedroso y Florencia (who had been Mayor of Havana in 1750)<lb/>
and was occupied by his family, widow (Dona Mariana<lb/>
Barreto) and descendants until it was rented in 1840 to<lb/>
the illustrious patrician Don Juan Montalvo y O'Farrill.</p>
<p>Other property owned by the Pedroso family included<lb/>
the Finca San Jose in the Havana suburb, Quemados de<lb/>
Marianas. I do not know just when the Finca San Jose<lb/>
was purchased by the Pedroso family but they owned the<lb/>
Finca from the middle of the 18th century; thus the Finca San<lb/>
Jose has been in the hands of the Pedroso family for<lb/>
about 200 years (1750-1950 ??).</p>
<p>The oldest available map of the Finca San Jose<lb/>
(framed and hanging in 1941 in the town home of Senora<lb/>
Rojas) is dated 1857 (I have copy) shows that the<lb/>
present residence (and the fence in front of it) facing Calzada<lb/>
Real existed as early as 1857. (When was the house built?).<lb/>
The fence is of masonry, a mixture (much used formerly)<lb/>
of rocks of all sizes, earth and clay covered with adobe.</p>
<p>The original Finca San Jose comprised about 100<lb/>
acres (       ). For along period (from<lb/>
1750- ?) the land was unoccupied. In the near<lb/>
of the property was limestone and about _____<lb/>
the stone began to be quarried. A limekiln and the<lb/>
stone quarry were operated &ldquo;from the year 1857&rdquo; and the<lb/>
<unclear>help</unclear> of negro slaves and chinese. The quarry and<lb/>
limekiln were leased by the Pedroso family during the<lb/>
years to various lessees; <del>for example they (and the<lb/>
residence) were leased to Dr. Colleja and Brother from _____ to<lb/>
July 31, 1900.</del></p>
<pb n="2" id="f03615010"/>
<p>2</p>
<p>From about 1873 to 1884 or 1885, (for about 11 years) the<lb/>
Finca San Jose with its residence was leased to the Jesuit<lb/>
priests (from nearby Belin college?) who used it (as a<lb/>
summer residence? Did they use it all year? For what<lb/>
purpose?) according to Dr C E Finlay, p. 82, the Jesuits<lb/>
sent their non-immune members to the residence on the<lb/>
Finca San Jose during the summer months. During there 11<lb/>
years not a single case of yellow fever developed among<lb/>
the <del>whole</del> residents of the Finca San Jose, a fact <unclear>commented</unclear><lb/>
upon by Dr. Chaille in his report of the American Yellow Fever<lb/>
Commission which visited Havana in 1879.</p>
<p><unclear>Presumably deserted</unclear> between 1898 and 1900 the Finca San Jose was<lb/>
used of the Military Health <unclear>Officer</unclear> of its American army<lb/>
(<unclear>get</unclear> dates; for what purposes? See Rojas entry of Nov 15, 1900)</p>
<p><del><unclear>Men</unclear> Dr Carlos Finlay denied in _______ to <unclear>innoculate</unclear><lb/>
volunteers for his mosquito experiments he apparently requested<lb/>
help from the Jesuits. His first two innoculations were<lb/>
on <add>non-immune</add> Jesuit volunteers who were bring at the Finca San<lb/>
Jose. These included the experiment</del></p>
<p>Dr Carlos Finlay's <del>began his</del><add>first</add> inoculation - experiments <del>in June 1881.</del><lb/>
were made in 1881 on soldiers and other volunteers in Havana.<lb/>
He continued his experiments in 1883; the first 2 volunteers of<lb/>
this series were non-immune Jesuit priests who were<lb/>
living at the Finca San Jose; one of these was Father<lb/>
<unclear>urra</unclear> who developed yellow fever on Aug 26, 1883. &ldquo;None<lb/>
of the other non-immunes (Jesuits) who were stopping at the<lb/>
farm contracted the disease&rdquo; (C. E. Finlay, p 82).</p>
<p>(Shortly after this (exactly when? ______) the Jesuits<lb/>
closed their lease on the San Jose Farm &amp; leased <del><unclear>La</unclear></del> as a<lb/>
&ldquo;pleasure farm&rdquo;, La Asuncion, in Luyans, 10 miles<lb/>
from Havana. Here Finlay carried on further experiments<lb/>
on Jesuit volunteers.)</p>

lessee when Major Walter Reed (through the mediation of<lb/>
Dr Echevarria and probably also of Dr Agramonte)<lb/>
