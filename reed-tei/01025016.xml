<salute>My dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I thank you for your letter in regard to Columbia, and<lb/>
the news of the new outbreak in that country. It does seem rather puzzling<lb/>
for yellow fever to break out there now after so many years of supposed free-<lb/>
dom from the disease. To me it scarcely seem logical that it can be a new<lb/>
outbreak. Is it not possible that it can be an instance of travelling from<lb/>
one place to another where, if it has been recognized, it has been kept quiet<lb/>
like our Peruvian friends tried to do? From my interviews with Columbians<lb/>
aboard ship it seemed that they were not at all disposed to declare that<lb/>
Columbia had anything even suspicious.</p>
<p>I do not know enough about Columbia and the density of population<lb/>
or the proximity of one town to another to be able to form any opinion as<lb/>
to the case with which infection could spread there. The climate of course<lb/>
is ideal for the fever, and I am almost sorry that I am not going to take<lb/>
a hand in it.</p>
<p>I received a telegram from Russel today saying that White had secured<lb/>
the services of Pareja and another man whose name I do not recall as I left<lb/>
the telegram in the office and am writing this from the house. Russel said he<lb/>
was writing me about it.</p>
<p>While I am becoming somewhat reconciled to this individual existence<lb/>
puttering along with one specimen after another I still &ldquo;feel the call of the<lb/>
wild&rdquo; and should like to be out fighting again. I wonder if a man ever feels<lb/>
satisfied after he had done something worth while. Even you from the remarks<lb/>
in your last letter do not seem entirely content not to be out on the frontier.<lb/>
However in your case you are doing a great thing in this history, a thing which<lb/>
posterity is going to take pride in I am sure. I find some men here who know<lb/>
and value your work as it ought to be, and who give you great credit for what<lb/>
has been accomplished not only in yellow fever but in the malaria and other<lb/>
public health work.</p>
<p>In as much as the I.H.B. did not go ahead with my offer to take up the<lb/>
work again after they asked me to do so, I think there is very little likeli-<lb/>
hood that I shall take up work of that sort again, as I can not very well re-<lb/>
main idly on the waiting list. I must go ahead definitely with one thing or<lb/>
another, and while I am here it is imperative to equip this laboratory and<lb/>
develope the diagnostic side of it which I want to do, and make it a thing<lb/>
not only for the making of money but a useful source of information. Even in<lb/>
a place of this kind if ones eyes are kept open there are a great many things<lb/>
to be learned, and interesting things do come up. Since returning I have seen<lb/>
a case of madura foot, a case of myelogenous leukemia and a case of filariasis.<lb/>
I must write Francis about the latter as he was especially interested in the<lb/>
incidence of this condition here. This woman gives a history of coming from<lb/>
Wisconsin, has lived a while in Montana, but in no other section in the south<lb/>
than Florida. In the last few days I found a freak tapeworm, where two com-<lb/>
plete (with the exception of the head) worms grew from the same segment.</p>
<p>The indications are that I shall be kept quite busy, and collections<lb/>
are fair.</p>
<p>I will very greatly appreciate seeing the sections of the history, and<lb/>
presume there is no prospect of my moving away from here for some time.</p>
<p>With the warmest affections from all the Hanson family,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely</salute>
<signed>Henry Hanson</signed>
