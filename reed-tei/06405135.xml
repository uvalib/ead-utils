<salute>My dear Col. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Mrs. Franck brought me yester-<lb/>
day the carbon copies of the dictated<lb/>
Qs and A's which she took on Wed. June 5-<lb/>
She says she has been <add>very</add> busy at the office<lb/>
of the Mil. Surg. and had to do the<lb/>
work at home where she was much<lb/>
interrupted (housekeeping etc)- She has<lb/>
mailed you the first copy as you directed<lb/>
and I went over the carbons last night<lb/>
and will get them off today- I am<lb/>
mailing this letter separately because<lb/>
it relates to the future and not to the<lb/>
past, and I feel that it should<lb/>
have been sent a week ago-</p>
<p>It relates to the Foreword volume - about<lb/>
which we talked when you were here-</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06405136"/>
<p>2</p>
<p>I have never been a quick thinker, as you<lb/>
and Gen. Ireland are, and my natural<lb/>
deliberation has been much slowed, like<lb/>
my physical movements, by age- You may<lb/>
have observed when you discussed the<lb/>
matter with me, that I was not enthu-<lb/>
siastic- When I took up your little memo<lb/>
of the contents and contributors and tried<lb/>
to lay out in my mind how my chapter<lb/>
should fit in with the others, which preced-<lb/>
ed and followed it, it became clear to<lb/>
me that a book cannot be written that<lb/>
way; even with you as editor and largely<lb/>
the author- It would be a medley, and<lb/>
not an effective introduction to a great<lb/>
story, It would not contribute to the sale<lb/>
of the <hi>magnum opus</hi>, but rather would<lb/>
determine the casual reader that if he had<lb/>
paid <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>2.50 for it he would not invest<lb/>
an additional <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>5.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> in the main work-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06405137"/>
You have done a wonderful work in your<lb/>
study of the Y. F. episode down to the petty<lb/>
details, many of which will not appear in<lb/>
your book but will be of value only if they<lb/>
help your mind to see shades and details more<lb/>
accurately- A man with newspaper <unclear>training</unclear><lb/>
like Burton J. Hendrick would never take this<lb/>
trouble, and so he will never produce a great<lb/>
work, tho he can write some like his<lb/>
Virginia <unclear>Lees</unclear> (the 3 brothers of Stratford in<lb/>
Revolutionary days) which are of interest and<lb/>
value- You have the energy and ability<lb/>
and the love of truth, with your wonderful<lb/>
background of professional experience to satu-<lb/>
rate your mind with the details and to<lb/>
produce a great book- It will live for-<lb/>
ever- I will not be alive to read it, but<lb/>
I have had the joy of seeing its making,<lb/>
and of contributing my mite to it- The<lb/>
names of those men whose names are on your<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06405138"/>
3<lb/>
Foreword memo, will mean nothing and<lb/>
add nothing to this generation, which will<lb/>
buy the book- They bore <del>a</del> parts in occur-<lb/>
rences of nearly half a century ago. Do<lb/>
not try to bring them forward when the<lb/>
century half-hour strikes- It is not worth<lb/>
the effort, as a matter of practical advan-<lb/>
tage, and may be a detriment to your<lb/>
great aim- Give what time you can spare<lb/>
from your professional work to the big <unclear><hi>avoca-<lb/>
tion</hi></unclear> of writing the book and dont let yourself<lb/>
be lured off by side issues-</p>
<p>Cornelia has read this letter and agrees<lb/>
with me and it is often that she does not<lb/>
do so- She is far from being a Yes <unclear>ma'am</unclear>-<lb/>
I wish inclose a memo about another matter<lb/>
on a separate sheet- I hope you met Mrs<lb/>
Hench at Harrisburg and were not too<lb/>
much overloaded with stuff that you should<lb/>
have sent home by express- Cordial regards to her</p>
