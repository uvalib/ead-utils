<p>A Happy New Year<lb/>
to you! my friend that<lb/>
is and chief that is<lb/>
to be- I found your most<lb/>
interesting letter of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
of Dec. here on my return<lb/>
from a tedious trip of<lb/>
inspections to Puerto<lb/>
Principe since two weeks<lb/>
ago- I have been in-<lb/>
tending ever since to<lb/>
have a chat with Gen-<lb/>
Wood but the two or three<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02601002"/>
2.<lb/>
times that I have seen<lb/>
him have been unable<lb/>
to get him alone- your<lb/>
story of the origin of our<lb/>
good friend La Garde's<lb/>
candidacy is a curious<lb/>
story- Damn old <unclear>Westens</unclear><lb/>
eyes, what does he mean<lb/>
by saying that there isn't<lb/>
a man above La Garde<lb/>
that is worth a damn-<lb/>
If I could not pick<lb/>
out half a dozen who<lb/>
are worth the whole<lb/>
Commissary outfit him-<lb/>
self included I would<lb/>
lot my hat. And in the<lb/>
same letter you tell me<lb/>
this story and also say<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02601003"/>
3/<lb/>
that on account of what<lb/>
the President said in<lb/>
his message you think<lb/>
it may be inadvisable<lb/>
for you to get letters from<lb/>
your distinguished scientific<lb/>
friends! What <hi>they</hi> think<lb/>
of your professional quali-<lb/>
fications stated in a letter<lb/>
to the A.G. is part of your<lb/>
record <unclear>two</unclear> Westen's advo-<lb/>
cacy of <del>Havard</del><add>La Garge</add> is<lb/>
personal influence pure<lb/>
&amp; simple- So if Root<lb/>
takes that, you can go<lb/>
ahead &amp; safely get all<lb/>
the letters you want, &amp;<lb/>
send them in -- to be filed<lb/>
as part of your record-<lb/>
Any man has a right to<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02601004"/>
4/<lb/>
do that, and I would<lb/>
do it if I were you-</p>
<p>Dear old Havard<lb/>
went away on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi><lb/>
I had not talked to him<lb/>
of your candidacy but<lb/>
only to Gorgas who is<lb/>
a warm backer of yours<lb/>
when I went down to<lb/>
see H. off he took me<lb/>
aside and said that<lb/>
as the S.G. <unclear>cy</unclear> seemed an<lb/>
open race that, <hi>after<lb/>
a talk with Gen. Wood<lb/>
and by the advice of the<lb/>
<unclear>Cutter</unclear></hi>, he had determined<lb/>
to become a candidate<lb/>
and would like to<lb/>
have my support-</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF CUBA.<lb/>
OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT<lb/>
DEPARTMENT OF CHARITIES.<lb/>
HAVANA.</p>
<p>You can imagine my<lb/>
surprise but I found<lb/>
my wits enough to say<lb/>
that his service in Cuba<lb/>
well entitled him to become<lb/>
a candidate but that<lb/>
I was entirely pledged<lb/>
to support you- Gorgas<lb/>
joined me a few min-<lb/>
utes later to told me<lb/>
that Col. H. had said<lb/>
the same to him and<lb/>
that he had replied<lb/>
substantially as I did-<lb/>
Gorgas and I are much<lb/>
puzzled at Col. H's state-<lb/>
ment that it was by Gen.<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02601006"/>
6<lb/>
Woods advice that he be-<lb/>
came a candidate, for<lb/>
neither of us will for a<lb/>
moment believe that the<lb/>
General has been in<lb/>
anyway <unclear>double</unclear> faced<lb/>
in the matter, or that he<lb/>
will really support H.<lb/>
And if he did not intend<lb/>
to support him why should<lb/>
he encourage the dear<lb/>
old fellow to go in for<lb/>
a certain disappointment-<lb/>
And on the other hand<lb/>
we agreed that H. was<lb/>
so unimaginative and<lb/>
matter of-fact that he<lb/>
was the last person in<lb/>
the world to assume or<lb/>
take for granted anything<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02601007"/>
There is no doubt that the old fellow went<lb/>
off with the belief that he could count<lb/>
on General Woods support- So you see<lb/>
why I am anxious to have a private<lb/>
chat with the General, and find out if<lb/>
possible what he did say to the old Col.<lb/>
<unclear>AS</unclear>- for the Generals cordial &amp; hearty<lb/>
support of you- I do not doubt it<lb/>
for a moment-</p>
<p>The last ten days has been full of<lb/>
troubles- It was for me the time to go<lb/>
on the bimonthly estimates of my institu-<lb/>
tions- and I had two weeks back office<lb/>
work to make up- and the North<lb/>
Altantic Squadron was in port and<lb/>
there was a function every night- so<lb/>
between much work &amp; much gaiety and<lb/>
little sleep the end of the old year<lb/>
found us a seedy lot- I went to<lb/>
bed yesterday as soon as I got back<lb/>
from the office with a fever &amp; an<lb/>
<unclear>intercostal</unclear> neuralgia which was<lb/>
nearly cutting me in two, and this<lb/>
afternoon I am just out of bed,<lb/>
Please give my best wishes for the new<lb/>
year, in which la <unclear>shiena jinis</unclear>- To Mrs Reed<lb/>
&amp; Miss Blossom &amp; believe me always</p>
