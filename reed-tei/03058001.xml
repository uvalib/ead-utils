Dr Wickliffe Rose<lb/>
General Director of the International Health Board<lb/>
New York<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is with the greatest pleasure that I reply to your<lb/>
kind letter of the 2nd instant, and thank you for your congratulations<lb/>
on my appointment as Director of Health.</p>
<p>The Minister was so good as to communicate to me the<lb/>
remarks as to the appearance and spread of yellow fever in the North of<lb/>
Peru, of which we have taken due note. Further, Dr Henry Carter had an<lb/>
interview with me, at the time of his visit to this port, during which he<lb/>
gave me detailed information on the situation in Peru with regard to<lb/>
yellow fever. As a consequence of this conversation and of the subsequent<lb/>
data which we have received, I found it necessary to extend the quarantine<lb/>
measures to all the ports adjacent to the infected zone, in view of the<lb/>
facility and frequency of communication between the said ports.</p>
<p>Upon Dr Hanson's request, I sent you some species of fish<lb/>
(millions, huaijas and chalacos) which have given good results in this city.<lb/>
In this, as in all other matters within my power, we shall try to co-operate<lb/>
in the task of eradicating yellow fever.</p>
<p>For our part, in Guayaquil strict vigilance is continually<lb/>
maintained over the water receptacles, with the same organization that has<lb/>
been functioning for the last two years. I can assure you that the Govern-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03058002"/>
2.<lb/>
ment and the inhabitants of this city are so thoroughly convinced of<lb/>
the importance of this work that will not be altered for any reason,<lb/>
and in the remote eventuality of any person suffering with yellow fever<lb/>
entering the country, this disease could not spread, since the number of<lb/>
Stegomyias is so reduced that we may consider it as the irreducible and<lb/>
harmless index. At present many foreigners and persons coming from the<lb/>
interior are visiting the city, without any case, even a suspicious one,<lb/>
having occurred. At the time of writing a fleet of North American<lb/>
submarines is also visiting our port; the crews came ashore at once, and<lb/>
are wandering around through the city happily. Guayaquil is as free of<lb/>
yellow fever as Havana and Panama. This is due undoubtedly to the<lb/>
beneficent action of the Board over which you preside, and in view of that<lb/>
fact I shall take special care to communicate to you the sightest incident<lb/>
bearing on this matter.</p>
<p>I am very happy to learn of the triumph obtained by the<lb/>
Board in Mexico and in Central America, and I wish to congratulate you on<lb/>
it with all the more pleasure since our good and generous friends, Dr Connor,<lb/>
General Lyster, Dr Bailey and so many others that the good judgment of the<lb/>
Board knows how to choose, are connected with this work.</p>
<p>I repeat that as for Guayaquil there is nothing to be feared.</p>
<p>With assurances of my deep respect, I remain,</p>
<closer>
