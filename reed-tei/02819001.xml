Dr. Ronald Ross,<lb/>
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,<lb/>
Liverpool, England.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Ross:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Our monthly reports have given you some idea of how sani-<lb/>
tary matters have been progressing at Panama since you left. The re-<lb/>
sults of the mosquito work I think have been all that we could have desired.<lb/>
Yellow fever has been done away with. Since December, 1905, we have had<lb/>
only one case on the Isthmus, and in the old &ldquo;hot bed,&rdquo; the city of Panama,<lb/>
not a single case since last November.</p>
<p>While we have had a good deal of malaria, the amount is not large.<lb/>
For the months of April, May and June, among the whites we averaged one death<lb/>
per month from this cause. Our force of whites is in the neighborhood<lb/>
of 5,000. Among the negroes for the same time we have averaged eight<lb/>
death from this cause; our force being about 23,000. June, July and August,<lb/>
being the middle of the rainy season, are of course our heaviest malaria<lb/>
months, but the total daily sick rate is very small, running from 15 per<lb/>
thousand in April to 50 per thousand in July. Fifty per thousand is about<lb/>
what our Army averaged last year, and I think is a most excellent showing for<lb/>
a force in Panama, and I think every year the conditions as far as malaria<lb/>
<del>are</del><add>is</add> concerned will improve.</p>
<p>You recollect that when you were here you spoke to me about certain<lb/>
letters which I was to write you, concerning Dr. Finley and Dr. Carter, and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02819002"/>
-2-<lb/>
their relation to the discovery of the part the mosquito plays in yellow fever.<lb/>
You thought at the time that you would propose them for the Nobel Prize. I<lb/>
merely mention it to remind you. It seems to me that the prize might very<lb/>
well be given to America in this connection and that Carroll and Agramonte,<lb/>
the two living members of the Board, might very well be included. It would<lb/>
somewhat balance the fact that it had been given to Sanarelli for his work<lb/>
which has turned out since to have no little foundation in fact.</p>
<p>no Pd Hench</p>
<p>This work, it seems to me, is way and beyond in importance many of<lb/>
the subjects that have received prizes in the last few years. In fact the<lb/>
only original research work whose practical results at all compare with it, is<lb/>
your work with regard to the mosquito and malaria.</p>
<p>I wish you could come down again and see how we have progressed<lb/>
since you were here. We are very much more comfortably fixed and could take<lb/>
very much better care of you than we did last time.</p>
<closer>
<salute>With kindest regards, I remain,<lb/>
Yours very sincerely,</salute>
