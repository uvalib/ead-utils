<salute>My very dear Friend,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am inclined<lb/>
to begin this letter to you with an apology<lb/>
as I did not write my usual Sunday<lb/>
letter. I went to church in the morning<lb/>
and in the afternoon Fred and family<lb/>
come in and in the evening I seem to<lb/>
have no energy to do anything-</p>
<p>As I write. Mabel has gone to see a<lb/>
friend who is ill - and the children<lb/>
are supposed to have their nap now.<lb/>
but I hear them talking - You would<lb/>
be amused at Peggy. she always<lb/>
wakes up once during the night-<lb/>
When Mabel went into babys room<lb/>
the other night as she was crying<lb/>
and said what is the matter? Peggy<lb/>
said <hi>crying botta</hi> - telling she was<lb/>
crying for <del>it</del> her bottle -</p>
<p>I never know how to spell the baby<lb/>
talk - so must <del>in her</del> explain -</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00413002"/>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>If I go to her anytime during the night<lb/>
she always says tory. tory, asking me<lb/>
to tell her a story. Houston sends his<lb/>
love, and says tell gammy about<lb/>
the balloon man - and that he had<lb/>
a balloon the <unclear>uder</unclear> day &ldquo;-- He says<lb/>
tomorrow we might go to see Baltimore<lb/>
gammy &rdquo;</p>
<p>Did I write you Jennie has been<lb/>
confirmed at the little church near<lb/>
them? I think I did --</p>
<p>Miss Helen Hyde expects to visit<lb/>
Jennie in May- I received a letter<lb/>
from Sister Helen - (Nell) to day she<lb/>
was looking forward to seeing you<lb/>
very soon! Spent evening &amp; went to a<lb/>
lecture by Voorlanger, on Napoleon<lb/>
the services are interesting, and the<lb/>
prayers are beautiful - We enjoyed the<lb/>
lecture very much. We still have<lb/>
the same cook (Hannah) since Emma<lb/>
went away- She concluded to remain<lb/>
she seems to be reliable - and not<lb/>
at all inclined to go out, especially at<lb/>
night. which is some comfort to<lb/>
Mabel &amp; myself. her kitchen is so very<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00413003"/>
(3)<lb/>
clean it does one good to see it by<lb/>
way of contrast to Emmas' --</p>
<p>she is a very good cook. at present<lb/>
Flora whom you know- comes every<lb/>
day to look after the children- she<lb/>
gets along very nicely with them<lb/>
and they play in the back garden<lb/>
till noon every day-</p>
<p>I have just read one of the cutest<lb/>
and most amusing books<lb/>
&ldquo;The Bread line&rdquo;, by Biglow Payne<lb/>
I <hi>wish you would try to get it</hi>.<lb/>
It is so very funny and one could<lb/>
read it in two evenings -</p>
<p>Some little time ago Mabel received<lb/>
a letter of congratulation from<lb/>
Dr Gilman, in which he enclosed a<lb/>
number of letters he had received<lb/>
in regard to Jesse - work, also a<lb/>
newspaper clipping, he thought Mabel<lb/>
would wish to keep them for the<lb/>
children. She also received a note<lb/>
of congratulation from Senator McCormas<lb/>
he thought the amount disgraceful--<lb/>
however --</p>

<p>AC<lb/>
L</p>
<p>March is such a cold month<lb/>
here that we will be glad to see<lb/>
the end of it - They hope to remove<lb/>
the building deficit. Easter Sunday-<lb/>
the amount is seven thousand<lb/>
dollars, three (3) thousand of which<lb/>
is pledged by the Vestry if the<lb/>
rest is given-</p>
<p>last Sunday <del>fifteen</del> fifty three were<lb/>
confirmed last Sunday!</p>
<p>Please give my love to Mrs Seth<lb/>
with love and best wishes to your<lb/>
own dear self-</p>
