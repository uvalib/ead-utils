<salute>My own dear Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>To write<lb/>
a letter, to-day, that will be<lb/>
so much as readable, will<lb/>
require, I fear, more of an<lb/>
effort than I am capable<lb/>
of. Imagine a clouded sky --<lb/>
a heavy mist covering the<lb/>
whole face of nature -- a<lb/>
damp atmosphere which<lb/>
almost chokes you, when<lb/>
inspired -- add to this a<lb/>
high temperature and an<lb/>
entire absence of any<lb/>
breeze, and you will have<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01641002"/>
formed an approximative idea<lb/>
of the weather at Willet's Point.<lb/>
It is such weather as subtra<add>c</add>ts<lb/>
<del>ever</del> from our frail frames<lb/>
every spark of electricity, and<lb/>
leaves both mental &amp; physical<lb/>
fibre completely relaxed.<lb/>
Notwithstanding this depression,<lb/>
I have no idea of neglecting my<lb/>
semi-weekly epistle to the <hi>dea-<lb/>
rest</hi>, <hi>sweetest</hi> &amp; <hi>best loved<lb/>
woman on earth</hi>! Exclaim as<lb/>
you please, &amp; summon<lb/>
Charles, if you like, but<lb/>
my opinion will remain<lb/>
as unalterable as before.<lb/>
I only wish that this letter<lb/>
could reach you, before<lb/>
you receive my attempt<lb/>
at &ldquo;rhyming&rdquo;- For really,<lb/>
my darling, I'm ashamed of<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01641003"/>
<hi>that</hi> production- I don't know<lb/>
to what to attribute my peer-<lb/>
less obtuseness, but I as-<lb/>
sure you, that during the<lb/>
whole time I was writing,<lb/>
there was a mist <del>that</del> be-<lb/>
clouding my mental hori-<lb/>
zon which I could neither<lb/>
shake off nor penetrate.<lb/>
Do what I would, the <hi>Muse</hi><lb/>
was obstinately perverse,<lb/>
nor would she so much as<lb/>
shake <hi>one</hi> dew-drop from<lb/>
her plumage. Had it not<lb/>
been owing to my deter-<lb/>
mination to avoid longer<lb/>
disappointing you, I should<lb/>
have annihilated that<lb/>
epistle, &amp; waited at some<lb/>
future day, the divine<lb/>
inspiration. In sending it,<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01641004"/>
I could not but feel an in-<lb/>
tense sympathy for the in-<lb/>
dividual (in this instance, the<lb/>
<hi>Sweetest</hi>, <hi>loveliest woman<lb/>
on earth</hi>:) who was compelled<lb/>
to read it. There was but<lb/>
one consolation; that <del>was</del><add>it</add>,<lb/>
would afford you material<lb/>
for criticism for many days<lb/>
to come, &amp; you know, my pre-<lb/>
cious E., that I much prefer<lb/>
<hi>your criticism</hi> to the <hi>praise</hi><lb/>
of all the combined spheres.<lb/>
Here let me say, that no man<lb/>
could write such a sentence<lb/>
as the above, unless he was<lb/>
desperately infatuated with<lb/>
some lady- At the same time,<lb/>
please remember that <hi>I</hi> am<lb/>
the man who wrote it, &amp; <hi>you</hi> -- the lady!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01641005"/>
More than this, I felt a restraint<lb/>
in writing rhyme, especially at<lb/>
certains stages of my letter-<lb/>
How could I rhythmically<lb/>
answer your caustic rem-<lb/>
arks concerning my departure.<lb/>
I know that you did not mean<lb/>
what you said- &ldquo;No reluct-<lb/>
ance&rdquo; in leaving? Emilie dear,<lb/>
I am more than surprised-<lb/>
<add>I might ask:</add> Did you show any emotion?<lb/>
But, never mind, when I next<lb/>
leave you, there will be<lb/>
no occasion for such a<lb/>
remark; for I will show you<lb/>
<del>an</del> unmistakable signs of <add>my</add><lb/>
emotion and devotion.</p>
<p>I again visited New York City<lb/>
yesterday -- Started early in<lb/>
the morning &amp; had a very<lb/>
delightful trip down the<lb/>
Sound in the Government<lb/>
Steamer- I first went<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01641006"/>
to Fort Wood, Bedloe's Island,<lb/>
to visit Dr Torney- Our re-<lb/>
union was very warm, &amp;<lb/>
I was asked many ques-<lb/>
tions about Miss Emilie.<lb/>
After lunch, we went to the<lb/>
city on board a Steam-<lb/>
Yacht which took us swift-<lb/>
ly over the waters of the<lb/>
Bay. My object in going to<lb/>
the city, among other things,<lb/>
was to get that all im-<lb/>
portant ring, which is to<lb/>
join our hands <hi>forever</hi>-<lb/>
After visiting several stores,<lb/>
I concluded to write &amp; get<lb/>
the measure of your finger<lb/>
before purchasing- I thought,<lb/>
at first, that a ring that<lb/>
would fit my little finger<lb/>
loosely would just fit your<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01641007"/>
ring finger, but I am so<lb/>
afraid that I might send<lb/>
one too large, that I prefer<lb/>
to have you send the exact<lb/>
measurement of your finger,<lb/>
&amp; then there can be no 'mis-<lb/>
take- I enclose a piece of silver<lb/>
wire which you can use for the<lb/>
purpose- Take the size of your<lb/>
finger &amp; cut off the remainder<lb/>
of the wire with a pair of<lb/>
scissors. Be sure to enclose<lb/>
the right piece of wire in your<lb/>
letter &amp; send it when you<lb/>
next write. Did the no.s of<lb/>
the Art Journal arrive?<lb/>
You must not hesitate to let<lb/>
me know of any delay that<lb/>
may occur. Tell Mrs. Dr<lb/>
Lawrence that I had a<lb/>
&ldquo;Spelling bee,&rdquo; a few eve-<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01641008"/>
nings ago- &ldquo;The most skilful <unclear>gan-</unclear><lb/>
ger I ever knew,&rdquo; etc was the<lb/>
subject of amusement- The<lb/>
gentlemen who did the spel-<lb/>
ling were Dr Byrne &amp; Lieu-<lb/>
tenant Lymons; the latter<lb/>
gentleman graduated at the<lb/>
head of his class at West<lb/>
Point, 2 years ago- Dr Byrne<lb/>
missed 34 &amp; Mr. Lymons 31-<lb/>
Tell Mrs. L. that I don't think we<lb/>
have much to be ashamed of<lb/>
as yet. (I wander how many Miss<lb/>
E.B.L. missed!) Remember me very<lb/>
kindly to all who dwell under<lb/>
the same roof with you. And<lb/>
remembering that I am ex-<lb/>
pecting a very sweet letter<lb/>
from you, to-morrow, believe<lb/>
me,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Now &amp; ever, your<lb/>
affectionate &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
