<salute>My darling Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Sunday<lb/>
passed and gone, the time for<lb/>
writing my Monday's letter again<lb/>
arrives. What shall I write<lb/>
on this most beautiful &amp; bright<lb/>
morning? Shall I tell my lit-<lb/>
tle girl of the athletic sports<lb/>
that I have taken part in during<lb/>
the past week? Such as box<lb/>
ing, daily; with a glove, on<lb/>
each hand, larger than my<lb/>
own head: or jumping over<lb/>
a string, held a wonderful<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01664002"/>
height above the ground; or swinging clubs<lb/>
of fabulous weight about my head; or ri-<lb/>
ding horses of prodigious strength &amp; speed?<lb/>
These &amp; many more, &ldquo;mirabile diet&rdquo; have oc-<lb/>
cupied my moments; and this morning, I be-<lb/>
gin to feel the effects. The latter displayed<lb/>
in a very strange manner- such as <add>an</add> in-<lb/>
ability to rise up quickly, or to walk fast,<lb/>
on account of various excruciating aches<lb/>
that rack my &ldquo;body physical.&rdquo; This is not<lb/>
all, for we are going to have a tour-<lb/>
nament this week: a real, sure-enough<lb/>
tournament- on horse-back- with rings<lb/>
suspended from a bar, &amp; spears with<lb/>
which to bear of these rings; but alas!--<lb/>
we have no Queen, upon whose fair brow<lb/>
the victor might place the crown! This is<lb/>
a sad deficiency, &amp; but for our innate<lb/>
love of athletic exercise, our tournament<lb/>
would &ldquo;go by the board&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Would you believe, after all I've told you, that<lb/>
I've not been happy, for several days past?<lb/>
As true as you live- Although, I said in my<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01664003"/>
last letter, that I had nothing<lb/>
to say concerning your corres-<lb/>
pondence with Mr Joynes (I don't<lb/>
know that I spell his name right<lb/>
or not, <del>yet</del> <add>but</add> you will understand,)<lb/>
of Baltimore, Yet I have <hi>thought</hi><lb/>
over the matter a good deal<lb/>
since I wrote. In fact, it has<lb/>
been absent from my mind,<lb/>
but for a few moments at<lb/>
a time. I've tried to shake<lb/>
it off, but the thought clings as<lb/>
tenaciously as ever. Call it<lb/>
<hi>jealousy</hi>, if you like. It may be,<lb/>
and probably is. Although I<lb/>
once imagined that I would<lb/>
never be jealous, &amp; although<lb/>
it <add>is</add> a strange confession for<lb/>
a gentleman to make to a lady,<lb/>
yet I find that the demands<lb/>
of truth require it. Call me<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01664004"/>
silly, if you please. But I'm only a boy, &amp;<lb/>
have not yet put aside silly thoughts and<lb/>
feelings. Older heads than mine have ached and<lb/>
older hearts have bled. I<del>ve</del> have not made<lb/>
objection to your correspondence, nor shall I<lb/>
do. Neither shall I tell you my own opinion.<lb/>
You would say it was a pre<del>d</del>judiced one &amp;<lb/>
as such would put it aside. Yet when I see<lb/>
a gentleman asking a lady to correspond <add>with</add> him-<lb/>
a lady whom he <hi>knows</hi> to be engaged- I am<lb/>
sensible enough to know that he intends to<lb/>
ask the lady's hand. And then when I think<lb/>
that he is a &ldquo;high-toned &amp; cultivated&rdquo; gentleman;<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01664005"/>
that he has a home in a beautiful City of<lb/>
the &ldquo;Sunny South&rdquo;; is surrounded by friends;<lb/>
is indirectly related to this lady; that he would<lb/>
have all the influence that could be possibly<lb/>
brought to bear upon a young heart to yield it-<lb/>
self to his keeping; and then turning to myself,<lb/>
think of my utter unworthiness; my lack of ed-<lb/>
ucation; my uninviting disposition; the life that<lb/>
is before me; my lack of ambition; my failures<lb/>
in the past; my prospects for the Future; ah!<lb/>
when, again &amp; again, I have revolved these<lb/>
thoughts in my mind (and they will not begone)<lb/>
I begin to see the bright vision, that has cheered<lb/>
me, for many months past, fade into dreariness &amp; dark-<lb/>
ness, and I can almost see the beautiful idol<lb/>
that, I have looked upon &amp; loved, <del>s</del>lying, at my feet,<lb/>
shattered into a thousand fragments! Oh! do not<lb/>
think that I do not mean what I say. There's no <hi>Irony</hi><lb/>
in this! Is the picture dark? Who can tell the va-<lb/>
rious changing scenes of a young girl's heart?<lb/>
The whence &amp; the wherefore? &ldquo;Oh! this morn I put<lb/>
my hand in thine &amp; vow that thee, alone I love&rdquo;!<lb/>
A day later, and the very echo of those words<lb/>
startles her! She fain would not own them!<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01664006"/>
&ldquo;Young gentlemen are not one whit more<lb/>
stable,&rdquo; you say, &amp; I will not deny it. Let a gen-<lb/>
tleman or lady, I care not who they may be, begin to<lb/>
share their time &amp; attention with another, and from<lb/>
that moment, the old love commences to grow dim!<lb/>
The <hi>Present</hi> governs the man, &amp; the woman too! And<lb/>
there is no escape. In conclusion, my little darling,<lb/>
let me say that if your new correspondent should<lb/>
develop into a near friend &amp; friendship into<lb/>
a holier feeling, do not let me stand in the<lb/>
way of your happiness. I would love you still.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, as ever, your<lb/>
fond &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
