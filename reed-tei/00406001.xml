<salute>My very dear Friend,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter<lb/>
has just reached me. I am so glad<lb/>
to hear from you. And it is always<lb/>
such a comfort to know you have<lb/>
been to see my dear little daughter.<lb/>
If a longer time than usual has<lb/>
passed since I wrote it is simply<lb/>
because I do not remember just<lb/>
when I do send a letter to you<lb/>
and the <del>say</del><add>same</add> way with Nell.<lb/>
Little Houston was speaking of<lb/>
you this morning, so I said what<lb/>
shall I say to Baltimore ganny.<lb/>
&ldquo;I send my love and tell her<lb/>
what Kris brought to me&rdquo; he<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00406002"/>
(2)<lb/>
answered- He still claims his<lb/>
toys, and the other day as little<lb/>
Peggy went to his Chair. He walked<lb/>
over to her and said. &ldquo;Ba ba what<lb/>
did I tell you about that chair&rdquo;?<lb/>
This morning he asked me if the<lb/>
heat was turned on? little Peggy<lb/>
is learning new words every day<lb/>
she does look so cute running around,<lb/>
she shuts all the doors- Mabel was<lb/>
so glad to know you were making<lb/>
her a sweater -- she <del>has</del> sleeps in<lb/>
one every night, and always wears<lb/>
them inside her dress this Winter.<lb/>
We have a furnace fire -- which heats<lb/>
Mabel -- room nicely. We have<lb/>
moved the Piano into this front<lb/>
room. The back parlor makes such<lb/>
a very pleasant setting room for<lb/>
us, but the front room does not<lb/>
look as well.</p>
<p>My son is still with me, he has<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00406003"/>
(3)<lb/>
been on a visit to the Modesto Ranch.<lb/>
He said the grain would <add>be</add> all right<lb/>
for two weeks yet as they had been<lb/>
having fogs for six weeks in this<lb/>
country -- but just think we have<lb/>
had no rain to speak of since<lb/>
you went away!-</p>
<p>Last Monday we spent the evening<lb/>
at the Murrays. I am ashamed to<lb/>
say it is the first time we have<lb/>
been there since your departure.<lb/>
We enjoyed seeing them very much.<lb/>
Did we neglect to mention <unclear>the</unclear> about<lb/>
this damask you sent? We were so<lb/>
glad to get it and thank you<lb/>
very much- I have just got the<lb/>
dining room rug from the cleaners<lb/>
and <del>and</del><add>am</add> pleased to see it looking<lb/>
so bright and clean. They have<lb/>
brought out the original color.<lb/>
I have my <hi>old friend Tom</hi> of whom<lb/>
you heard me speak so often<lb/>
this man who said &ldquo;I should not<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00406004"/>
worship a <hi>graven image</hi>&rdquo; to clean<lb/>
for me, he does so much better<lb/>
than the Japs- Yesterday <hi>we</hi><lb/>
gave the parlor a good cleaning.<lb/>
I worked till nearly four. Then<lb/>
went to make two calls in the<lb/>
neighborhood-</p>
<p>That reminds me to say. Mabel &amp;<lb/>
I went to call on an artist friend<lb/>
Mrs Richardson- And I thought<lb/>
while then if you <add>should</add> come to <del>Las</del><lb/>
our city again? I should at once<lb/>
propose our going to see Mrs R.<lb/>
You can not imagine what a<lb/>
magnificent view one has from<lb/>
her house of all the Bay, the<lb/>
Golden Gate -- and the whole<lb/>
city- He house is so beautiful<lb/>
in its simplicity -- it is so<lb/>
restful and beautiful-</p>
<p>I was very sorry to hear Thomas was<lb/>
not well, but have quite recovered<lb/>
by this time?</p>
<pb n="5" id="f00406005"/>
<p>I did not renew my subscription<lb/>
in time to get the &ldquo;<unclear>Mu</unclear>; in Art&rdquo;<lb/>
yet. I believe I wrote you about<lb/>
my Christmas books. I love &ldquo;The<lb/>
Child of Nature&rdquo; have read it<lb/>
twice. It is all true poetry in prose-<lb/>
Then my other books. &ldquo;The World<lb/>
Beautiful&rdquo; by Lilian Whiting- I think<lb/>
you would be interested to read<lb/>
the first and second series-<lb/>
I pick up this book every day<lb/>
and find it very helpful-,<lb/>
How did you enjoy &ldquo;this right<lb/>
of way&rdquo;?- We thought it delightful-<lb/>
I wonder if you have reserved<lb/>
<del>my</del> the Transcripts (Boston) There is<lb/>
such a beautiful article in it on<lb/>
Jesse in life and work. We have<lb/>
just received a number of copies<lb/>
which Walter sent us by request.</p>
<pb n="6" id="f00406006"/>
<p>AC<lb/>
L</p>
<p>Miss Mitchell sent the most<lb/>
beautiful lace (Namiton) for the<lb/>
baby I have ever seen. Mabel thinks<lb/>
she will keep it till Peggy is older-<lb/>
Please remember me to Mrs Seth.<lb/>
With love and best wishes.</p>
