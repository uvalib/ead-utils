Senora Estela Agramonte de Rodriguez Leon<lb/>
K Street No. 254<lb/>
Vedado, Havana<lb/>
Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Senora Rodriguez Leon:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Saturday I notified you by cable that I had been away and that I<lb/>
was assembling your father's data. Yesterday I sent you air mail a key to<lb/>
the tin box in which today I have air mailed, by registered post, your father's<lb/>
data. All of the material is returned. Herewith I enclose an extra key in<lb/>
case the one should have been lost. Just keep the tin box, it may be of use<lb/>
to you.</p>
<p>I am delighted to know that the present government is finally in-<lb/>
terested in doing something with respect to the work of your father and the<lb/>
other members of the U. S. Army Board and of course Finlay. If the lectures<lb/>
are published, I would certainly appreciate having at least one copy. If there<lb/>
is a price for the lectures, please let me know. Someone certainly ought to<lb/>
collect them.</p>
<p>I appreciate very greatly indeed your permission to borrow <unclear>those</unclear><lb/>
papers of your father's and am sure that they will arrive safely. We put on<lb/>
the outside a sticker as follows: &ldquo;Cuban Postmaster and Customs Officials:<lb/>
This is a tin box containing nothing but old letters of considerable personal<lb/>
value but of no commercial value whatever.&rdquo; I hope that by this note the box<lb/>
will not be held up in customs but delivered to your home, and our local post<lb/>
office thought that that would be the case.</p>
<p>Regarding your postscript, I have a fairly complete record of your<lb/>
father's comings and goings, orders and appointments that I collected from<lb/>
data chiefly in the National Archives Building in Washington. There is no<lb/>
question but that he was absent from Havana from about September 23, certainly<lb/>
from September 24, to October 12, 1900. Your own papers which I am returning<lb/>
also established the fact and the reason for his absence and the National Archives<lb/>
contains his Personal Report written in his own handwriting confirming this<lb/>
&ldquo;leave of absence&rdquo; which was later considered not as a formal leave but as a<lb/>
special erand for reasons which your papers show.</p>
<p>There is confirmatory evidence regarding this in an article by Hemmeter,<lb/>
written in English and published in a Dutch historical magazine, Janus 1908, are<lb/>
printed a number of letters from Carroll to his wife. In one letter dated<lb/>
September 23, 1900, Carroll wrote to his wife &ldquo;Agramonte left for New York yesterday<lb/>
with his wife.&rdquo; Your father had originally had a 15 day leave-of-absence granted<lb/>
by Special Order 164, Headquarters Division of Cuba, September 21. The U. S<unclear>,</unclear><lb/>
Army transport Sedgewick, left Havana September<unclear>_</unclear>24 and returned October 12.<lb/>
General Truby who was at Lazear's funeral has been puzzled through the years<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f05803051"/>
Senora Estela Agramonte de Rodriguez Leon<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>
August 21, 1950<lb/>
to know why your father was not at Lazear's funeral. Indeed, no member<lb/>
of the Board was at Lazear's funeral and he commented upon this in his book<lb/>
and there is also a very brief note about your father's absence, saying that<lb/>
he was on leave. The return trip of the Sedgewick took 18 days and it is<lb/>
General Truby's assumption, which seems to be born out by your father's<lb/>
Personal Report, that he took the Sedgewick as he left on the day that the<lb/>
boat left Havana and returned on the day that the boat returned to Havana<lb/>
but since he only had 15 days leave the additional three days was taken care<lb/>
of by giving him a three-day extension of leave as per Special Order 182,<lb/>
Headquarters Division of Cuba, October 16, 1900.</p>
<p>See <unclear>Truby's</unclear><lb/>
book<lb/>
pp 129-130</p>
<p>In view of your father's own records, the above can hardly be dis-<lb/>
puted. The only two places where your father permitted another inference were<lb/>
as follows. In a letter to Mrs. Mabel Lazear dated July 15, 1930, on your<lb/>
father's stationery, he wrote a lovely letter of <unclear>condolence</unclear> and reminisced<lb/>
about his contacts with Doctor Lazear. One sentence reads &ldquo;Every moment of<lb/>
our contact at Camp Columbia is still vivid in my mind until the moment of<lb/>
his (Lazear's) passing away at the hospital, which day I shall never forget as<lb/>
long as I live.&rdquo; One must consider that your father was merely using a figure<lb/>
of speech. Your father knew that Lazear was sick but may or may not have<lb/>
realized when he last saw him, how very ill Lazear was. I doubt very much if<lb/>
your father knew of Lazear's death until some time after he landed in New<lb/>
York. Also in this same vein, one must interpret your father's remarks on<lb/>
page 562 of the Military Surgeon, November 1930, paragraph 3, which constitutes<lb/>
the 6th page of your father's article in the Military Surgeon, &ldquo;One contribution<lb/>
by Army Medical Officers to Science&rdquo;, in which your father describes the worry<lb/>
of those in care of Lazear. One sentence reads &ldquo;On September 26 we buried him.&rdquo;<lb/>
Again that is a figure of speech. Obviously <unclear>when</unclear> he learned later of Lazear's<lb/>
death, undoubtedly he regretted his absence and as he pondered over the un-<lb/>
fortunate illness and death of Lazear he doubtless grieved as if he had been<lb/>
there and later expressed his thoughts along those lines. In other words, I<lb/>
think your father meant that he was there in spirit even though he did not<lb/>
so state.</p>
<p>All of this however is not particularly important but since you<lb/>
raised the question. I am giving you the information. I have all of Reed's<lb/>
letters to his widow and of course Reed was in Washington at the time and knew<lb/>
even less about Lazear's illness than did your father.</p>
<p>In a few days, if I can clear up a very crowded desk, I will send<lb/>
you a two or three page synopsis of your father's orders, goings and comings,<lb/>
and activities between April 18, 1898 when he wrote to General Sternberg<lb/>
<unclear>offering</unclear> his services and June 15, 1903 when his second Army contract was ended.</p>
