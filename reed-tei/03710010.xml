Greetings From Washington and Jefferson College<lb/>
<dateline>
<date value="1940-12-13">December 13, 1940</date>
</dateline>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Under separate cover I am sending you 45<lb/>
pictures of different scenes taken on Founders'<lb/>
Day. These pictures were made by the D. A. Har-<lb/>
baugh Studio in Washington.</p>
<p>Since this is the last of the pictures that<lb/>
we will have, I filled out the check which you<lb/>
sent me in October to the amount of $27.50. This<lb/>
will pay for the pictures which I got for you some<lb/>
time ago from Mr. Arnold, as well as for the pic-<lb/>
tures I am sending today. Arnold's pictures cost<lb/>
$18.50 and Harbaugh's bill was $9.00, making a<lb/>
total of $27.50.</p>
<p>We are still at a loss about the pictures<lb/>
of Moran and Kissinger. Since we have been unable<lb/>
to find them anywhere in our files, we have mailed<lb/>
pictures to Mr. Moran and Mr. Kissinger and have<lb/>
asked them to autograph one for you. When writing<lb/>
to them, we assumed responsibility for the loss of<lb/>
the first pictures so that they may be sure that<lb/>
they were not lost due to any negligence on your<lb/>
part.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember saying to Miss Hough<lb/>
when your pictures arrived that we did not need<lb/>
the pictures of Moran and Kissinger. I had already<lb/>
received pictures from each of the men. I pointed<lb/>
out to her the paragraph in your letter stating<lb/>
that the autographed pictures were enclosed but<lb/>
that I had not found them in the package when it<lb/>
came. When the pictures arrived, I looked them<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03710011"/>
Page 2.<lb/>
over in Dr. Hutchison's office. I remember sitting on<lb/>
the edge of Miss Hough's desk and selecting the pictures<lb/>
I wanted for the dinner program. The only pictures I<lb/>
had then were the ones published in the dinner program.</p>
<p>I hope that Mr. Moran and Mr. Kissinger will get<lb/>
their autographed pictures to you very soon.</p>
<p>As you may know, much of the delay in these mat-<lb/>
ters on my part has been due to my absence from the<lb/>
office and my marriage, which is enough to keep a fel-<lb/>
low in an uproar for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>With kindest regards, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
