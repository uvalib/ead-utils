<salute>My dear Dr. Amesse:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Believing that it will be of interest to you, I send you a<lb/>
copy of the report of Major Ogden Rafferty, Medical Corps, U. S.<lb/>
Army, in the case of Ram&oacute;n G&oacute;mez who was found with yellow fever<lb/>
on the S. S. Julia in the port of San Juan on July 5th. The clini-<lb/>
cal report attached was kindly furnished to Maj. Rafferty by the<lb/>
quarantine officer, Dr. Foster. Attached is also a copy of a<lb/>
telegram from Capt. H. D. Thomason, Medical Corps, U. S. Army,<lb/>
Special Commissioner of the Sanitary Department at Santiago.</p>
<p>You will observe that there is an apparent conflict between<lb/>
the statements made by Ram&oacute;n G&oacute;mez to Maj. Rafferty that he stay-<lb/>
ed only one night in Santiago and the entry on the register of<lb/>
the fonda La Union in Santiago showing that he was there on the<lb/>
29th. Of course it is possible that he <unclear>stayed</unclear> two nights instead<lb/>
of one in Santiago, and it is also equally possible, and I think<lb/>
more probable, that the people at the fonda may have failed to<lb/>
put in the new date of June 30th, and allowed a guest to register<lb/>
under the date of the day before. It is also entirely possible<lb/>
that his attack began before July 4th as we constantly find to<lb/>
happen in the case of Spaniards in whom the first symptoms are<lb/>
not very severe and especially when they are sea-sick. Even,<lb/>
however, if all suppositions are rejected which shorten the<lb/>
period between his leaving Daiquir&iacute; and his being sick from<lb/>
the afternoon of the 29th to the afternoon of the 4th is 5 days which<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06227002"/>
2-Dr. J.W.A.<lb/>
gives a day to spare for the possible incubation period for<lb/>
him to have contracted the disease at Daiquir&iacute;. As he stayed<lb/>
in Daiquir&iacute; in a focus of active infection and no case of fever<lb/>
has occurred in the locality where he stayed in Santiago, all<lb/>
the non-immunes there being under daily inspection, it seems<lb/>
to me that the inference is inevitable that the disease was<lb/>
contracted in Daiquir&iacute;</p>
<p>I would suggest that after looking over these papers, you<lb/>
forward them to your Department in Washington.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
