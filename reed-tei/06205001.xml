Reed April 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
<dateline>
Ancon, Canal Zone<lb/>
<date value="1905-03-26">March 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1905,</date>
</dateline>
<salute>My dear Kean,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yours of March 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> received.<lb/>
<unclear>And</unclear> at the same time my copy of the<lb/>
Journal containing <hi>Reeds report.</hi><lb/>
I am much surprised at its publi-<lb/>
cation and cannot <del><unclear></unclear></del> see the Secretaries<lb/>
object in having it published. I hard-<lb/>
ly think that Reed would publish it<lb/>
without the Secretaries consent.</p>
<p>I presume that the President has made<lb/>
up his mind to get rid of the Commis-<lb/>
sion and allows the report to be pub-<lb/>
lished in order that his position toward<lb/>
the Commission may be strengthened<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06205002"/>
2<lb/>
If this is not the case and the Commis-<lb/>
sion remain it seems to me that they<lb/>
would bounce their Chief Sanitary Of-<lb/>
ficer as soon as they were able. If<lb/>
I had a subordinate who gave material<lb/>
for such a report I certainly should<lb/>
get rid of him the first opportunity.<lb/>
So I think I had better wait a short<lb/>
time before I <del>he</del> make a move and<lb/>
see just how the wind will blow.</p>
<p>It has not done me any harm down<lb/>
here with Davis &amp; Wallace. Gen. Davis<lb/>
for the past six weeks has thrown up<lb/>
his hands entirely. Gives me every<lb/>
thing within his power without<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06205003"/>
3<lb/>
question or going into details. Wallace<lb/>
&amp; I have always been entirely in accord.</p>
<p>He tells me that he will be glad to see<lb/>
me entirely independant and reporting<lb/>
direct to the War Department and thinks<lb/>
that I should. And says that I can<lb/>
count upon him for assistance in any<lb/>
way in which he can give it.</p>
<p>The Sanitary Department is sailing<lb/>
along with favorable <unclear>breezes</unclear> just<lb/>
now. The last case of yellow fever<lb/>
occurred in Panama on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and<lb/>
the total sick report from all causes<lb/>
is less than two per cent of the laborers.<lb/>
I have no doubt that we will have<lb/>
a few more cases of yellow fever<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06205004"/>
4<lb/>
from time to time but I believe that<lb/>
we have practically gotten it under<lb/>
controle. Will you please return me<lb/>
the correspondence with reference to the<lb/>
<unclear>Lisbon</unclear> Congress. The paper on the sanitary<lb/>
conditions at Panama inclosed with<lb/>
them was the paper I intended for <unclear>Col-<lb/>
llecker</unclear>. I found a carbon copy which<lb/>
I sent him.</p>
<p>I agree with <unclear>Gen. O Reilly</unclear> entirely that<lb/>
Army men should <unclear>preponderate</unclear> in the<lb/>
Sanitary Department I will be glad<lb/>
to have more. I will apply for <unclear>Stroul</unclear><lb/>
at once with the idea of putting him in<lb/>
as health Officer at either Colon or Panama<lb/>
till other vacancies occur. Cable received<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06205005"/>
5<lb/>
from Col. <unclear>Weigmar</unclear>. <unclear>Shimer</unclear> I could<lb/>
use some when on the line. Now about<lb/>
M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Cullough &amp; Deverence.</p>
<p>I think that I had better not ask for<lb/>
any ones relief till I find how I<lb/>
stand. Suppose I asked for Sprat-<lb/>
lings relief now. Gen. Davis &amp; Ad-<lb/>
miral <unclear>Walker</unclear> would both oppose.<lb/>
And I would simply be turned down<lb/>
and my position considerably weaken-<lb/>
ed. The most important thing for<lb/>
me just now is to get my status <unclear>fixed</unclear><lb/>
If possible to report direct to the war<lb/>
Department &amp; <unclear>cut loose</unclear> from the<lb/>
Governor. Then I can <unclear>prove</unclear> with<lb/>
a free hand. We must certainly<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06205006"/>
6<lb/>
hear something definite very soon.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that our bill has such<lb/>
good prospects. Let me know when<lb/>
the proper time comes for writing to<lb/>
<unclear>Millains</unclear> &amp; I will gladly do so.</p>
<p>Remember me most cordially to<lb/>
Gen. O'Reilly, &amp; tell him that every<lb/>
&ldquo;<unclear>dammed</unclear>&rdquo; <unclear>Jemaca</unclear> negro on this<lb/>
Isthmus will be <unclear>cinchonized</unclear> unless<lb/>
the Commission succeed in bounc-<lb/>
ing me &amp; that very soon. <unclear>Weather</unclear><lb/>
conditions are very good along<lb/>
the line. I have not seen a danger-<lb/>
ously ill malarial case in a month.<lb/>
We have gotten the line pretty well<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06205007"/>
7<lb/>
drained. <unclear>Have</unclear> <unclear>got</unclear> a thousand men<lb/>
on our rolls. I know this makes<lb/>
Gen. Davis sick when he thinks of it.<lb/>
But I have the old man under <unclear>hand</unclear><lb/>
when I ask for fifty more men<lb/>
he simply says approved. Does not<lb/>
even ask what I want with them.<lb/>
He is too meek. I am afraid that<lb/>
he has it up his sleeve for me.</p>
<p>But even if I get bounced now<lb/>
I will not feel it as I would have<lb/>
six month ago. We have shown that<lb/>
a good deal can be done by san-<lb/>
itation and I think that I have<lb/>
made it pretty clear that a good<lb/>
deal more could have been<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06205008"/>
done if the Commission had used<lb/>
even common sense. I do not like<lb/>
the personalities of Reeds report, but it<lb/>
is true &amp; the Commission know it.<lb/>
If it does <unclear>unseed</unclear> me it will give them<lb/>
a pretty good <unclear>jolt</unclear> which they will<lb/>
not forget in a long time.</p>
<p>Please remember me to Mrs. Kean.<lb/>
Mrs. Gorgas continues to improve<lb/>
<unclear>report</unclear> to start back about April<lb/>
