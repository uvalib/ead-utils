<salute>Dear Dr. Hutchison:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Through the kindness of our office an appoint-<lb/>
ment was arranged for me to meet Lord Dawson of Penn this<lb/>
morning at 9:30. I called at his home at 32 Wimpole Street,<lb/>
W.1. He received me in his study and we got along<lb/>
beautifully. He is a very lovely man. I presented your<lb/>
letter to him and we had a chat for over half an hour.<lb/>
He was as gracious as he could be and he made it very plain<lb/>
that he was deeply appreciative of your courtesy. He came<lb/>
to the door with me when I left. The following are the<lb/>
facts.</p>
<p>COPY</p>
<p>Lord Dawson is the President of the Royal Col-<lb/>
lege of Physicians which position he has held since 1931.<lb/>
He will likely be re-elected. October is an important<lb/>
month in the school's activities and he is wondering how<lb/>
his colleagues at the school would feel if he were absent<lb/>
at that time. In a nice way he showed me how strongly<lb/>
they followed old traditions as the school goes back to its<lb/>
original charter which was granted by Henry VIII. He did<lb/>
not promise that he would go, but said he would give it<lb/>
his consideration and let you know. My bet would be that<lb/>
he will go as he has not been in the States since 1929.<lb/>
There is no question but what he would make a wonderful<lb/>
impression, and that he would give a good talk, as I have<lb/>
ascertained here that he is a good speaker, and it would be<lb/>
a great event to get him to come to America for the purpose<lb/>
of coming to W. &amp; J. I promised to do anything for him<lb/>
that he might wish when he came to New York. Let us hope<lb/>
that we will be successful.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
