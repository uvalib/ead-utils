<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>I must begin this letter<lb/>
with an apology for being such<lb/>
a poor correspondent. I am<lb/>
not going to waste your time<lb/>
with excuses but when I reflect<lb/>
how busy you are and how<lb/>
much leisure I have, if I had<lb/>
the energy to use it, as you do,<lb/>
I am ashamed. I read all the<lb/>
newspaper reports of the celebra-<lb/>
tion and of the excellent ad-<lb/>
dresses of yourself and Dr<lb/>
Sawyer, who I knew of course<lb/>
by reputation, and your very<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06284116"/>
2<lb/>
interesting letter of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> instant.<lb/>
Please accept my congratulations<lb/>
on your degree of Sc. D. which you<lb/>
have so well earned. I would<lb/>
like to hear when you next write<lb/>
about the other degree which<lb/>
you have received in the last<lb/>
six months. It is doubtless for<lb/>
you work in arthritis.</p>
<p>I am greatly interested in your (confi-<lb/>
dential) information about Mrs.<lb/>
Lazear. I was told not long ago<lb/>
by a friend who had seen her<lb/>
in California that she was a<lb/>
difficult and rather unapproach-<lb/>
able person. It is good to know<lb/>
that you have brought out a more<lb/>
human and fitting reaction from<lb/>
the widow of a man who at 34 had<lb/>
made himself one of the immortals.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06284117"/>

Have you learned anything about<lb/>
the Lazear family? Are they of<lb/>
Huguenot descent? I was calling<lb/>
on an old friend, the widow of<lb/>
Col. H.J. Slocum who came from<lb/>
Pittsburgh and I mentioned your<lb/>
work &amp; the W. &amp; J. celebration.<lb/>
She said that as a young girl<lb/>
(more than 50 years ago) she recalled<lb/>
having driven out some 6 or 7<lb/>
miles from the city to a party<lb/>
at the house of a Mr. Lazear<lb/>
whose daughter was a friend<lb/>
of hers. I think Mrs. J. (who was<lb/>
a Miss Rickerson) said her name<lb/>
was Frances and she married<lb/>
a Mr. Orr. Doubtless the Mrs. Chas-<lb/>
P. Orr who was at your celebration<lb/>
was her daughter. Mrs. S. said that<lb/>
the old gentleman pronounced his<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06284118"/>
4<lb/>
name L&aacute;zer, with the accent on the<lb/>
first syllable, but his children<lb/>
pronounced it as we do.<lb/>
Dr. Carlos E. Finlay, son of the<lb/>
discoverer of the Finlay, <add>theory</add> has been<lb/>
good enough to send me a copy<lb/>
of his book and I have read the<lb/>
first 100 pages in it with great<lb/>
interest. I wrote to thank him<lb/>
before reading <del>page</del> chapter IV<lb/>
which discusses the old doctor's<lb/>
experimental inoculations, &amp; did<lb/>
so intentionally as his successful<lb/>
cases can only be considered pos-<lb/>
itive by greatly extending the periods<lb/>
of Intrinsic and extrinsic incubation<lb/>
beyond those fixed by the experi-<lb/>
ments of the Reed Board. The<lb/>
extraordinary thing about these is<lb/>
that with all the handicaps under<lb/>
which an unofficial private experimenter<lb/>

would necessarily labor, he was able<lb/>
to carry them out at all and preserve<lb/>
his enthusiasm and faith so many<lb/>
years. But as Guiteras pointed out<lb/>
in 1901, if he did not have the<lb/>
official backing &amp; money to experi-<lb/>
ment with perfectly controlled condi-<lb/>
tions, his epidemiological arguments<lb/>
were perfectly sound. You will find<lb/>
at the bottom of page 72 &amp; Top of 73<lb/>
where Guiteras states very prettily in<lb/>
one sentence Finlays best claim to<lb/>
be the discoverer of the &ldquo;<unclear>Teor&eacute;a</unclear> Finlay&rdquo;.<lb/>
I think it a pity that Carroll after the<lb/>
death of Reed, <del>May 1903</del><add>Nov. 23, 1902</add> was so trench<lb/>
ant <unclear>and</unclear> severe in his criticisms of<lb/>
Dr. Finlays experimental cases as in<lb/>
his article the transmission of yellow<lb/>
fever, Jour A.M.A May 23, 1903. You will<lb/>

6<lb/>
this, if you wish to look at it, pp 175 to<lb/>
185 of the Congressional Reprint - which you have.<lb/>
now as to my diary Vol. V. I have<lb/>
begun to copy what is there &amp;<lb/>
will send it to you, in your nice<lb/>
tin box, in a few days. It isn't<lb/>
much as I was ordered to Wash-<lb/>
ington in Jan. 1901 and did not<lb/>
get back until after Reed had<lb/>
read his famous paper, with its<lb/>
11 Conclusions, before the Pan-Amer-<lb/>
ican Med. Congress in Havana<lb/>
Feb. 4-7, 1901 and had gone back<lb/>
to Washington. So there isnt much<lb/>
about the yellow fever work in this<lb/>
volume and a lot of other matter<lb/>
which would not interest you<lb/>
I will send it along soon with<lb/>
another letter. With all good wishes</p>
