<salute>My dear Doctor Cooke:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Some months ago, I visited Mrs. Walter Reed and her daughter<lb/>
in their home in Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania, about sixty miles out-<lb/>
side of Washington. They showed me many souvenirs of Doctor Reed, including<lb/>
an old scrap book and some photographs. In the scrap book was a newspaper<lb/>
article, cut out and pasted in the book. It included the only actual photo-<lb/>
graph of the &ldquo;Yellow Fever Wards&rdquo; that I have ever seen. I had it photo-<lb/>
graphed and am enclosing a copy. Can you identify it as the little group<lb/>
of buildings across the railroad track from the main hospital at Camp<lb/>
Columbia? Also, Mrs. Reed let me copy a photograph of a group of men<lb/>
under a tree. I am absolutely certain that this photograph was taken at<lb/>
Camp Lazear. You will notice dimly in the background on the extreme left<lb/>
what I believe to be one of the tents, and behind and between figures No.<lb/>
4 and 5 you will notice another tent. General Kean, to whom I sent the<lb/>
photographs, was not able to recognize any of the figures and was not even<lb/>
sure that it was taken at Camp Lazear; however, General Truby and I both<lb/>
believe that it was taken at Camp Lazear and that figure No. 2 may well be<lb/>
yourself. I am inclined to agree also with General Truby that figure No.<lb/>
4 may be Mr. Kissinger. I can not recognize figure No. 7 as Walter Reed,<lb/>
but General Truby thought it might be he in civilian clothes. I was a<lb/>
little concerned to see the figures of the children. Was not Camp Lazear<lb/>
kept rather free of strangers?</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you would examine this photograph, pre-<lb/>
ferably with a hand lens, and <unclear>tell</unclear> me if you are figure No. 2 and also tell<lb/>
me to what extent you can agree with <xref id="f05811020">General Truby's identification</xref>. It<lb/>
is his handwriting on the back of the photograph. I would appreciate it,<lb/>
also, if you would return these two photographs to me at your earliest con-<lb/>
venience.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>

P.S. Would you like to have any more copies of my article in Hygeia?<lb/>
with the colored reproduction of the yellow fever painting? I have<lb/>
quite a lot of them at home and would be delighted to send you as<lb/>
many as you wish: 25, 50, even 100; as many of them as you want.<lb/>
