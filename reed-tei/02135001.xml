Monday morning<lb/>
Oct. 8. How is<lb/>
the sweetest oom-<lb/>

Cocoon this morn-<lb/>

unnumbered for<lb/>
my dear, dear<lb/>

<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your dear<lb/>
letter of last Sunday,-- al-<lb/>
most one week ago -- was<lb/>
received, this morning, and<lb/>
you can't imagine how<lb/>
glad I was to get it, and<lb/>
that, too, from the <hi>very sweet-<lb/>
est</hi> woman in the world!<lb/>
How I would like to have<lb/>
seen dear Miss Room-fixer<lb/>
down on her very &ldquo;Mar-<lb/>
-row-bones&rdquo;, demonstrating<lb/>
to that horridly stupid<lb/>
<hi>man</hi> how to wax a floor!<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02135002"/>
That was right, lovie, dear-<lb/>
give it to him! There<lb/>
is nothing like making<lb/>
a <hi>man</hi> do things <hi>right</hi>!<lb/>
<hi>Of course</hi> the parlor looks<lb/>
sweet &amp; attractive, if my<lb/>
joy had the arranging<lb/>
of it! How's that for<lb/>
a real, nice compliment?<lb/>
you see that although<lb/>
your <hi>bad</hi> mantee has<lb/>
come all the way to<lb/>
Cuba, he hasn't forgotten<lb/>
how to pay compliments<lb/>
He hopes that many,<lb/>
many years will pass<lb/>
ere he ceases to say<lb/>
sweet things to his<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02135003"/>
precious, precious wifie!<lb/>
Now, you musn't have<lb/>
any fear about my being<lb/>
here <hi>now</hi> any more than<lb/>
you did in <hi>June</hi> for there<lb/>
is much less danger <hi>Now</hi>-<lb/>
<hi>Then</hi> we had an epidemic<lb/>
<hi>next door</hi> to us- <hi>Now</hi><lb/>
it's no nearer than Ha-<lb/>
vana -- 6 miles away-<lb/>
Honestly, lovie, dear,<lb/>
could you ever have<lb/>
respected &amp; loved me<lb/>
if I had proved my-<lb/>
self to be a <hi>moral<lb/>
coward</hi>? I don't believe,<lb/>
when you come to con-<lb/>
sider the matter carefully<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02135004"/>
but that you will yet<lb/>
say that I did the right<lb/>
and proper thing- Certain-<lb/>
ly <hi>my</hi> conscience would<lb/>
have never rested ea-<lb/>
sily- Dr Lazear contracted<lb/>
the disease at the yellow<lb/>
fever <add>Hospital in Havana</add> by letting an in-<lb/>
fected mosquito bite<lb/>
him- He saw the insect<lb/>
on his hand &amp; deliberate-<lb/>
ly let it get its fill<lb/>
of blood in order to<lb/>
test our theory- Five<lb/>
days later he had his<lb/>
chill, followed by high<lb/>
fever- His case was<lb/>
a very severe one from<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02135005"/>
the beginning, his death<lb/>
occurring on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
day there after- He was<lb/>
a splendid, brave<lb/>
fellow &amp; I lament his<lb/>
loss more than words<lb/>
can tell; but his death<lb/>
was not in vain-<lb/>
His name will live<lb/>
in the history of those<lb/>
who have benefited<lb/>
humanity- The dan-<lb/>
gerous part of the<lb/>
work is now over &amp;<lb/>
there is no need for<lb/>
you, my sweetheart, to con-<lb/>
tinue to worry about me.<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02135006"/>
When I want any thing<lb/>
done in Havana, Dr<lb/>
Carroll goes in for me.<lb/>
I am so glad that Mr<lb/>
Wilde came over and<lb/>
fixed your corner shelves,<lb/>
I know that you are much<lb/>
more comfortable than<lb/>
you were- By the way,<lb/>
I must enclose a nice<lb/>
little note that dear<lb/>
Doctor Flexner wrote<lb/>
to you in care of the Surg,<lb/>
General &amp; which the chief<lb/>
clerk stupidly sent<lb/>
here to me, Flexner<lb/>
is a dear, good, kind-<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02135007"/>
hearted friend &amp; you<lb/>
must write to him<lb/>
at once &amp; thank him.<lb/>
I can't write any more<lb/>
just now, sweet oom-<lb/>
sey, but will add some<lb/>
more tomorrow- <hi>Boo! Boo!<lb/>
Sunday Evening</hi>. <hi>7<hi rend="superscript">th October</hi></hi> - well<lb/>
what a lovely day this has been<lb/>
&amp; I have enjoyed it so much-<lb/>
Dr Kean, your friend, has been<lb/>
over to see me and four or<lb/>
five other officers called to see<lb/>
me- I am getting along very<lb/>
nicely in my old quarters<lb/>
and have a most surprising<lb/>
appetite- I can't imagine why<lb/>
I should eat so much <hi>here</hi>,<lb/>
but is nevertheless true.<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02135008"/>
If it were only cooked a<lb/>
little bit better, I am afraid<lb/>
that I would hurt myself<lb/>
eating- How has that dear joy<lb/>
gotten along at school? Have<lb/>
patience with her, mother, dear,<lb/>
if she doesn't progress rapidly<lb/>
in literature- I hardly <del>need</del><lb/>
think that she needs to take<lb/>
French- She probably wouldn't<lb/>
advance very much in it-<lb/>
Did you get the pencil letter that<lb/>
I wrote off the N.Y. Light Ship-<lb/>
The pilot said that he would<lb/>
mail it, but I am afraid that<lb/>
he did not- Of course, you<lb/>
haven't had any letter yet<lb/>
as the first mail leaving Ha-<lb/>
vana since my arrival was<lb/>
only on yesterday- I missed<lb/>
Wednesday's mail as I arrived<lb/>
on Thursday- Boo! Boo!</p>
