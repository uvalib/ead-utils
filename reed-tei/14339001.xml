<salute>My dear Gran</salute>

<p>Your letter of the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
came today and brought<lb/>
us much comfort by the<lb/>
good news that George<lb/>
had passed his crisis<lb/>
and was recovering-<lb/>
I had been consoling Louise<lb/>
with the assurance that<lb/>
it must have passed, &amp;<lb/>
as we had had no cable<lb/>
he must be doing well,<lb/>
but the assurance of the<lb/>
fact is much better<lb/>
than the supposition.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f14339002"/>
<p>I think George will be<lb/>
very comfortable and run<lb/>
no risks in the Maes-<lb/>
tranza- There are evident-<lb/>
ly no loaded mosquitoes<lb/>
there, as nothing happens<lb/>
to the fifty or more non-<lb/>
immunes who make their<lb/>
home there- Altho it is<lb/>
near the harbor George<lb/>
will not find either the<lb/>
air or the building damp<lb/>
at this season, which is<lb/>
you remember the beginning<lb/>
of the dry season in Cuba<lb/>
We will be delighted to<lb/>
see the old fellow &amp;<lb/>
Molly in Cuba, and I<lb/>
only wish we had some<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14339003"/>
place to put them so we could have a<lb/>
visit from them- But we can eat them<lb/>
if we cant sleep them &amp; the drives to<lb/>
the Barracks &amp; back will be fine for<lb/>
the invalid when he gets stronger- I<lb/>
have such a nice carriage &amp; team too<lb/>
now- I wish I had had it a year ago<lb/>
when you were with us-</p>
<p>I will put my good friend the Chief<lb/>
Sanitary Officer of Havana on guard<lb/>
over George to see that no mosquito, unless<lb/>
per chance a harmless &ldquo;pungens&rdquo; comes<lb/>
<unclear>nigh</unclear> his dwelling, but what can even<lb/>
this high official, even tho he is next<lb/>
door do for Georgie if his charming<lb/>
hostess has the itch! I would recom-<lb/>
mend that he shake hands with himself<lb/>
like George Francis Frain- But I saw<lb/>
Gertrude at the Drum's reception Saturday<lb/>
and she gave no ocular evidence of para-<lb/>
sitic cutaneous irritation, She may at<lb/>
some time have itched but I dont think<lb/>
she could have had the itch - and that<lb/>
swell nurse! Parish the thought! We are<lb/>
all very well indeed &amp; I am boning for my exam.</p>
<p>Love to George &amp; Moll when you see them or write-</p>
<p>The beautiful Bobbie is in short dresses with red kid shoes &amp; is<lb/>
much admired. With much love</p>
