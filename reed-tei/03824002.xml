<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your first letter arrived<lb/>
while I was on a little vacation and it seemed I was swamped for<lb/>
a while and the rest was gross neglect, in answering your letter.</p>
<p>No matter how big we try to be, we still have<lb/>
some things that stick in our systems that we can't forget. I treated<lb/>
Kissingers at Andrews when they were down and out, and no<lb/>
recognition had ever been made of his feat. He made the remark<lb/>
to my father once that I was the first doctor that hadn't charged him<lb/>
anything. I was instrumental in getting him his present home and<lb/>
pension, through my second cousin S.M. Keltner of Anderson, et al.</p>
<p>Since he came into prominance, while he is<lb/>
a child of the medical world, he has devoted all of his interests<lb/>
to chiropractic, and they only called me after the chiropractor was<lb/>
satisfied that he was going to die.</p>
<p>We might finish Mrs. Kissinger before discussing<lb/>
John. She is nervous and jittery, but I think able to do all of the<lb/>
work that John requires. I think she is the type that would accept<lb/>
all that was offered her, and would graciously say &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; would feel<lb/>
that the giver owed it to her. I have been furnishing all of the<lb/>
medicine, and they don't offer to send for it, and I pay the taxi to<lb/>
take it up to them.</p>
<p>Congress bought him his present home, and<lb/>
allowed him a pension for life. I don't know how much, but imagine it<lb/>
was sufficient for them to live on. So much for the side slant on the<lb/>
personal side.</p>
<p>Mr. Kissinger is much better. Up and around the<lb/>
house, sits on the porch and talks rather intelligently. Blood pressure<lb/>
about normal and kidneys Neg.</p>
<p>While he had what we termed a stroke, there was<lb/>
something peculiar about it. I am not enough of a neurologist to<lb/>
make a diagnosis, but the mental side was predominant. He didn't know<lb/>
anything, couldn't talk, laid in bed and responded poorly to everything,<lb/>
and retained the use of his limbs, although there was marked weakness<lb/>
on the one side.</p>
<p>Do not believe there would be any use in sending<lb/>
him to a hospital, even if he gets worse, and certainly not now. Have<lb/>
a feeling if he gets another attack that he will die in a short time,<lb/>
and that there is no treatment that will help much. If he continues to<lb/>
improve as he has in the last few weeks, he will be in fair condition,<lb/>
although his mentality is far from normal.</p>
<p>I hope this answers some of the questions in<lb/>
laymans terms. If things get to where something has to be done, I will<lb/>
call on you. Apologizing again for the delay in answering your<lb/>
letter, I am yours</p>
