Important.</p>
<p><hi>Sanitary Work in Cuba</hi>.<lb/>
<unclear>First Intervention.</unclear></p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Spanish War the Army was as placid and pacific an<lb/>
institution as the sun looked down upon in his diurnal journey. Look<del>p</del>ing back from<lb/>
the strenuousness of the succeeding decade we can truly say in the words of the<lb/>
Psalmist that &ldquo;its ways were ways of pleasantness and all its paths were peace&rdquo;.<lb/>
The Medical Department shared in the i nocuous desuetude of this idylic existence<lb/>
and was a very subordinate factor of military life. I cannot recall in the 14 years<lb/>
of my service previous to 1898 any mention of the Medical Department in the Reports<lb/>
of the Secretary of War or the speeches or messages of the President or in any im-<lb/>
portant publication. Since the beginning of the new era our Corps and its works are<lb/>
much in the public eye and are frequently in evidence in the utterances and writings<lb/>
of the President and the Secretary of War. Our <hi>status</hi> has greatly changed and grown<lb/>
in importance. Without disparagement to the excellent work which has been done by<lb/>
the Medical Corps in Porto Rico the Philippines the Isthmus of Panama and elsewhere<lb/>
it is not too much to say that this change is due in great part to the sanitary re-<lb/>
generation of Cuba and primarily to the extinction of yellow fever in the Island.</p>
<p>It seems not unreasonable therefore that the President of this School should<lb/>
desire that <del>this the largest class in its history</del><add>the medical officers just intering the service</add> should have some familiarity with<lb/>
the details of that glorious work, and should demand them of one who was on the<lb/>
ground and in intimate association with the principal performers. <del>My only regret<lb/>
is that I have not the practice and facility in speaking to which you are accustomed<lb/>
in the learned professors who usually occupy this platform which would enable me to<lb/>
give to the story the interest which it deserves.</del></p>
<p><del>I think that it is safe to assume that you are all familiar with the classical<lb/>
experiments of the Reed Commission and with the general results of the application<lb/>
of the mosquito theory by Gorgas, so I will not go into these, but will if you will<lb/>
pardon a rather personal and remniscent narrative, give you a brief account of con-<lb/>
ditions in Cuba before these experiments <add>some unpublished details with regard to them</add> and then a few points in practical sanitary</del><lb/>
<add>Lecture give before Army Med<lb/>
School May 2 1910 and May 22 1912</add></p>

<p>1 1&sol;2</p>
<p>It is safe to assume that you all have a general familiarity with<lb/>
the classical experiments of the Reed Commission, but I think for members<lb/>
of the Medical Corps of the Army a somewhat more intimate and accurate<lb/>
knowledge should be expected and I have arranged to have placed in your<lb/>
hands for the future personal use of each a copy of the Compilation <add>made by Capt Love of the S.G.O. and</add> print-<lb/>
ed by Congress <add>at the request of the S.G.</add> which includes all of Reeds own reports of his work in<lb/>
Cuba, together with articles throwing light upon other parts of this great<lb/>
work by Carroll, Gorgas, Finlay and Havard. The memorand<add>a</add>ums in the 3rd<lb/>
and 4th chapters were prepared by me and include I believe the names of<lb/>
all individuals who took part, either as conductors or as the subjects of<lb/>
these experiments. As the story is told fully and in official form in<lb/>
this valuable publication, I will not go into details which are <del>told in it</del><add>narrated there</add><lb/>
but<add>,</add> if you will pardon a rather personal and reminiscent narrative, I will<lb/>
give you a brief account of conditions in Cuba before the arrival of the<lb/>
Yellow Fever Board and some unpublished details with regard to their work.</p>
<p>When Santiago was captured by our troops it presented all the horrors<lb/>
of a besieged city. Bodies of men and animals, dead of wounds or<lb/>
disease were scattered through the streets <add>and houses</add> and as all sanitary services<lb/>
had been abandoned during the siege the accumulation of filth made the<lb/>
condition of affairs intolerable. General Leonard Wood was placed<lb/>
in command of the city and the conquered territory and the energy and<lb/>
thoroughness with which he brought the city into a good sanitary condition<lb/>
and organized a government attracted wide-spread attention and laid the<lb/>
foundation of his future career. <hi>Colonel Valery Havard was appointed<lb/>
<del>as</del> chief surgeon on August 7, 1898 and</hi> continued as chief surgeon of the<lb/>
department of Santiago <hi>until his transfer in 1900 to Havana where he<lb/>
occupied a like position for the division of Cuba</hi>.</p>
<p>2</p>
<pb n="3" id="f06242004"/>
<p>2</p>
<p>organization.</p>
<p>I accompanied the 7th Army Corps to Cuba, being Chief Surgeon, 1st Division<lb/>
and landed in Havana Dec. 28, 1898, just in time to be with my Division Commander<lb/>
Gen. Keifer (<del>now</del><add>lately</add> a representative in Congress from Ohio) at the imposing ceremonies<lb/>
incident to the transfer of the Sovereignty over Cuba from Spain to the United States.<lb/>
Sitting on our horses on the Prado we saw the red and yellow flag hauled down from<lb/>
the flagstaff of the Morro where it has floated for nearly four centuries <add>(</add>with one<lb/>
brief interruption,<add>)</add> and saw its place taken by the Stars and Stripes. Three years<lb/>
and five months later I saw the American flag give place on the same staff to the<lb/>
Cuban.</p>
<p><hi>Cuba was for the purposes of government a military division divided in 1898<lb/>
into seven military departments corresponding in limits to the six provinces and the<lb/>
city of Havana</hi>. The number of departments was reduced after Gen. Leonard Wood was<lb/>
transferred from Santiago to Havana as the successor to Gen. Brooke and after a couple<lb/>
of years Cuba was made one single Department.</p>
<p>The whole country outside of the cities was laid waste and the latter were fill<del>ing</del><add>ed</add><lb/>
with starving reconcentrados, who had to be furnished food and tools and work animals<lb/>
in order to be established in their desolate homes in the country. The cities were<lb/>
in a state of indiscribable filth and neglect and <hi>in every tained breeze we feared to<lb/>
inhale the mysterious infection of the dreaded yellow fever</hi>. There was no central<lb/>
sanitary organization but each of the seven Chief Surgeons went bravely to work to<lb/>
solve his own problems without other expert assistance than the oc<add>c</add>a<del>s</del>sional advice of<lb/>
the Chief Surgeon of the Division whose supervision was however confined largely to<lb/>
the military administration. This lack of bureaucratic organization lasted through-<lb/>
out the period of the first intervention, and it is highly creditable to the medical<lb/>
officers and others concerned in the sanitary work of the military government that<lb/>
such good results were attained under so loose a system.</p>
<p><hi>In Havana where were the greatest problems<add>,</add> Major Gorgas was</hi> Chief Surgeon, but<lb/>
3<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06242005"/>
3<lb/>
during the first year, <hi>he was not permitted to have</hi> any thing to do with the sanitary<lb/>
administration of the City <hi>which was under a volunteer surgeon better known for per-<lb/>
sonal energy than for scientific attainment</hi>. When some comment was made to the<lb/>
General who was Governor of the city<add>,</add> a distinguished officer of Engineers, as to the<lb/>
peculiarity of this arrangement he was said to have replied &ldquo;Oh in that matter I pre-<lb/>
fer to furnish my own brains&rdquo; <hi>When in Dec. 1899 he offered me the position of Chief<lb/>
Sanitary Officer of Havana</hi> I was compelled to think the compliment a somewhat dubious<lb/>
one. <hi>Early in 1900 however both this General and his energetic sanitary officer de-<lb/>
parted for the Philippines</hi>. The city of Havana was added to the Department of Gen.<lb/>
Fitzhugh Lee on whose staff I was serving as Chief Surgeon and Major Gorgas became<lb/>
Chief Sanitary Officer of the city reporting directly to Gen. Wood who <add>had</add> came into su-<lb/>
preme command of the Island.</p>
<p>The work of the Sanitary Department <add>in Havana</add> consisted in house-to-house inspections of<lb/>
dwelling houses, shops, factories, stables, &amp;c., with the enforcement of sanitary con-<lb/>
ditions - the disinfection of cases of infectious disease including very extensive<lb/>
disinfections of houses, clothing, &amp;c., for yellow fever, the regulation of the markets<lb/>
and the collection of vital statistics. <add><del>Within a few months</del> after the establishment<lb/>
of American control the city was clean and garbage regularly removed. The organ-<lb/>
ization of the other function of a sanitary department took longer.</add></p>
<p>I was doing work of the same sort in the garrisoned towns of the Province of<lb/>
Havana and Pinar del Rio and had in addition the care of the orphan asylums which had<lb/>
been established by Miss Clara Barton, President at that time of the American Red<lb/>
Cross Society. This benevolent lady after renting the houses, employing teachers<lb/>
and servants and collecting all that she could of the abundant crop of orphans left<lb/>
by the victims of the reconcentration calmly sailed away to the United States without<lb/>
provision for house-rents, services, or food, leaving the military Governor to hold<lb/>
the bag. This Gen. Brooke promptly passed on to Gen. Lee and he in turn to his chief<lb/>
surgeon. Thus I acquired 16 orphan asylums in one day. There were moreover public<lb/>
hospitals in all the larger towns crowded with unhappy creatures perishing in filth<lb/>
and neglect from every variety of disease. These had all been brought into order<lb/>
4</p>
<p>Within a few months after the establishment of American control<lb/>
Havana and the other principal cities of Cuba were clean, the streets<lb/>
were being repaired, and garbage regularly removed. This service was in<lb/>
Havana under an officer of the Engineer Department, Col. Wm. M. Black, and<lb/>
was admirably organized, the relation of the Sanitary Department to it being<lb/>
inspectorial only. The placing of houses and private premises in a<lb/>
sanitary condition was in charge of the Sanitary Department and was like-<lb/>
wise carried on with great energy. The first cleaning up was done by<lb/>
the sanitary gangs and householders were thereafter required to maintain<lb/>
a proper state of cleanliness. The organization of the other and more<lb/>
technical functions of a Sanitary Department such as the collection of<lb/>
vital statistics, the reporting and investigation of contagious diseases,<lb/>
the establishment of laboratories, the enforcement of vaccination, etc.,<lb/>
took a longer time.</p>

and fairly good administration by April 1900. <add>Col. E. St. John Guble F. A is entitled<lb/>
to the credit of first bringing order &amp; good administration into the institutions<lb/>
under the Dept. of Charities. I succeeded him as Supt. of <unclear>Beneficincia</unclear>
 in Gen. Woods Staff in April 1901.</add></p>
<p><hi>Early in May <unclear><del>of</del></unclear><add>1900</add> <del>year</del> Gen. Wood came out on a visit to Gen. <add>Fitz</add> Lee at Marianao<lb/>
the town which was the Headquarters</hi> of the latter and <hi>near the post of Columbia Bar-<lb/>
racks where were 1200 American Soldiers</hi><add>,</add> and <add>he</add> remarked that it was cleaner than any New<lb/>
England Village. The inhabitants endured our scrubbings and sweepings and disinfec-<lb/>
tions with patient good humor accompanied by many shrugs, and the only Kick which I<lb/>
recall was against the use of carbolic acid to disinfect cesspools because they said<lb/>
it gave a bad taste to the water in the wells! We had all accepted the doctrine<lb/>
that yellow fever was a filth disease and great was our consternation to find that<lb/>
summer that cleanliness was no protection, and the disease which we all so frankly<lb/>
dreaded went through Havana <add>and</add> Marianao, like a fire. In Marianao we finally only<lb/>
checked it by forceably expelling from town all non-immunes and putting them in Camp.</p>
<p>It was in the midst of this epidemic on June 25th that Major Reed and Dr. Carroll<lb/>
came to Cuba and organized the Yellow Fever Board<add>,</add> Drs. Lazear and Agramonte being<lb/>
already there. <hi>I was at the time sick with the disease and Reed came the day he<lb/>
landed out to the hospital at Columbia Barracks to see me. I believe that I was the<lb/>
first yellow fever patient which he had ever seen for tho he had been in Havana for<lb/>
three weeks in March <add>to investigate the use of electrozine as a disinfectant</add> there was then very little fever in the city</hi>. The Board spent<lb/>
the month of July in searching for the bacillus icteroides of Sanarelli both in the<lb/>
blood and excretions of the sick and in the organs of the dead and was able to show<lb/>
in 18 cases that it was not present, thus giving a final quietus to Sanarelli's<lb/>
claims.</p>
<p>Reed and Agramonte had however in July investigated a sharp epidemic among the<lb/>
American troops at Pinar del Rio and were particularly struck with the fact that a<lb/>
<hi>prisoner in the guard house had been attacked altho he could not have been in any<lb/>
infected locality and Dr. Agramonte says that the possibility of mosquito infection<lb/>
was discussed with reference to this case and it was determined to try it</hi>. <add>Carters -<lb/>
observation.</add></p>
<p>Dr. Carroll has stated that the final decision to make experiments <del>i</del><add>o</add>n human<lb/>
5<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06242007"/>
5<lb/>
beings was made <hi>the night before Reed returned on August 1st to Washington</hi> to com-<lb/>
plete <add>the</add> publication of the great Report on Typhoid Fever in the Volunteer Camps by<lb/>
Reed. Vaughan and Shakespeare. The Board had before this talked on the subject with<lb/>
Dr. Carlos J. Finlay. of Havana, who had maintained in numerous publications since<lb/>
1881 the mosquito transmission of yellow fever and had made between tha t date and<lb/>
Reed's first report no less than 103 experiments on human beings to demonstrate his<lb/>
theory.- <del>yet lathe he had selected the right species of mosquito as the carrier he<lb/>
did not succeed in producing the disease in a single case. The shortest interval</del></p>
<p>It is very interesting to study these cases which were recorded in a careful<lb/>
and scientific manner, for they show the extraordinary difficulties which the be-<lb/>
ginners in this field had to encounter, and illustrate the admirable acumen with<lb/>
which Reed drew his conclusions. <hi>Dr. Finlay reports 16 cases out of 103 as success-<lb/>
ful but in order to do so he had to extend the incubation period to 25 days, altho.<lb/>
in none of Reed's or Guiteras cases was the incubation period longer than 6 days.<lb/>
Also it is my understanding that many of these cases were exposed to other sources<lb/>
of infection. Rejecting the cases in which the incubation period was more than 6<lb/>
days we have left four in none of which was there albuminuria and only one of which<lb/>
presented the clinical symptoms of yellow fever. In none of these cases was the<lb/>
mosquito infected by a case in the first three days of the disease and in none of<lb/>
them had a longer period than 6 days elapsed since the mosquito had bitten the<lb/>
infecting case and so was not ripe</hi>.</p>
<p>Applying our present knowledge that <hi>cases of yellow fever can only infect mos-<lb/>
quitos in the first three days</hi> of the disease and <hi>secondly that a period of twelve<lb/>
days must then pass before the mosquito becomes ripe</hi> and able to convey the infection,<lb/>
<hi>we find that none of Dr. Finlay's cases fulfilled both of these conditions, and so<lb/>
in 20 years of work <add>we</add> can safely say that he did not produce a single case of experi-<lb/>
mental yellow fever</hi>. And yet with what <hi>Gorgas called &ldquo;splendid scientific clairvoy-</hi><lb/>
ance&rdquo; he held to his theory with unshaken tenacity.</p>
<p>6</p>
<pb n="7" id="f06242008"/>
<p>6</p>
<p>It was between these two stools of the short infecting stage in the human patient<lb/>
and the long incubation stage in the mosquito that Lazear fell in his first 9 experi-<lb/>
ments all of which were failures, much to the discouragement of the Board. In the<lb/>
two other cases of this series those of Carroll and X.Y. the mosquito had become ripe<lb/>
and he promptly got results. <hi>The case X.<del>X</del><add>Y</add>. was bitten on August 31st the day that Dr.<lb/>
Carroll was taken sick but before his sickness was recognized</hi>, and I think that it<lb/>
deserves some mention on account of the immense importance of it.</p>
<p><hi>Dr. Carroll</hi> who was at that time somewhat skeptical in the matter of mosquito<lb/>
transmission <hi>had vitiated the value of his attack as</hi> a scientific experiment by going<lb/>
into the infected zone and even to the yellow fever hospital after he was bitten and<lb/>
during the period of incubation, and <hi>so it was on this case X.Y. that Reed rested the<lb/>
burden of his proof in his Preliminary Note</hi>. <hi>It was <add>the</add> X.Y. case which convinced him</hi>.</p>
<p><hi>Reed was you remember in Washington in August and September and Lazear wrote to<lb/>
him the account of these two cases</hi>. I happened to be in the city of Matanzas on Oct.<lb/>
3rd when the transport came into that port with Reed on board and I went out to see him.<lb/>
<hi>It was there that I heard for the first time the true story of X.Y.</hi> which had been kept<lb/>
<hi>by Lazear a close secret. He wrote it to Reed but it is my impression that he told no</hi><lb/>
one <add>at Camp. Columbia, and I, altho. Ch. Surgeon of the Dept. and living only half a<lb/>
mile from the hospital knew nothing of the facts in the case.</add></p>
<p>The story is this:- On the morning of Aug. 31st <hi>Lazear</hi> took seven mosquitos in-<lb/>
cluding four that had bitten yellow fever patients, one of them being the insect which<lb/>
had bitten Carroll 4 days <del><unclear>v</unclear></del><add>b</add>efore, <hi>into a ward of the hospital at</hi> Columbia Barracks and<lb/>
<hi>said &ldquo;Who will feed my mosquitos&rdquo;. A good natured cavalryman <add><unclear>interfering or</unclear></add> offered to do so</hi>.<lb/>
Whether he was told that the mosquitos had bitten yellow fever patients I do not know<lb/>
but as these mosquitos had uniformly failed so far to cause infection the matter was<lb/>
probably not regarded as very risky by Lazear and it is my impression that he did not<lb/>
mention it. <hi>Next day the soldier was returned to duty and on Sept. 5th came back to<lb/>
Hospital with yellow fever</hi>. Columbia Barracks was at that time under strict quarrantine<lb/>
which it was proved the soldier had observed so he had not been otherwise exposed and<lb/>
7<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06242009"/>
7<lb/>
the case was clear.</p>
<p><hi>But the dread of yellow fever was so great and the orders of the military author-<lb/>
ities so strict on the subject of exposure that it is probable that if the commanding<lb/>
officer had found out that a purposely infected soldier had been let loose in the<lb/>
midst of his 1200 non-immune men there would have been a great row and probably some<lb/>
court-martials. So the man's name was concealed and Reed in writing his preliminary<lb/>
note did not admit that he was a soldier</hi>. I laughed much at his efforts to conceal<lb/>
this fact and told him that if he suppressed too many details the scientists would not<lb/>
believe him while if he told them the military authorities would get him.</p>
<p><hi>A year later when Carroll infected two soldiers Privates Hamann and Covington of<lb/>
the Coast Artillery with filtered blood their commanding officer started out to make<lb/>
trouble about it</hi>. But the victory had been won. Havana was free from yellow fever<lb/>
and every one was happy and proud of this great triumph of our Corps. Besides it was<lb/>
well <hi>known that the great authority of General Wood was behind these experiments. So<lb/>
the communications of this officer were quietly pigeon-holed</hi>. But it would have<lb/>
probably been far different in 1900.</p>
<p>It is however desirable now that <hi>this probably unconscious volunteer</hi> should have<lb/>
his name added to the roll of honor and so <del>a few days since</del><add>in 1910</add> I collected all the data<lb/>
concerning him and had no difficulty in identifying his name on the Report of Sick and<lb/>
Wounded of Columbia Barracks for Sept. 1900, as that of Pvt. William H. Dean, Troop B.<lb/>
7th Cavalry, born in Ohio, aged 27 years.</p>
<p>I hope that the day is not far off when Congress will erect a statute to Walter<lb/>
Reed in this city and that its pedestal will bear on three sides the portraits in<lb/>
base-relief of Carroll, Lazear and Agremonte, while the fourth should contain the names<lb/>
of those who submitted to these famous experiments. In this list the name of William<lb/>
H. Dean should come next below that of Carroll.</p>
<p>8</p>
<pb n="9" id="f06242010"/>
<p>8</p>
<p>To return to <hi>Dr. Finlay: He was able to indicate to Reed the actual variety of<lb/>
mosquito which was the transmitter of the disease and to present him with its eggs</hi><lb/>
for breeding purposes. <hi>This suggestion must have been of much assistance to Reed's<lb/>
Board for if they had begun with any other variety the technical difficulties of<lb/>
breeding and handling the insects would have been far greater and the patience of the<lb/>
Board might not have like that of Dr. Finlay stood the test of a long series of</hi><lb/>
failures. The stegomyia <hi>is a domesticated and tractible insect which breeds well<lb/>
in captivity and is perfectly willing to bite any fist which is thrust into</hi> its jar.<lb/>
In fact it can be carried in the pocket in a test tube plugged with cotton, and if<lb/>
the plug is withdrawn and the mouth of the tube placed upon the patient's skin it<lb/>
will promptly descend and bite. <hi>The common brown culex pungens cannot be got to<lb/>
bite in this way, and in an experiment of Reed's with pungens he could only get them<lb/>
to bite by placing them inside the mosquito bar of the patient. When he went to<lb/>
collect them in the morning he found that the Spanish patient had taken his revenge<lb/>
on them by killing them all. I think this ended the experiments with pungens</hi></p>
<p>A couple of yeras ago I had occasion to ask Dr. Guiteras to make some experiments<lb/>
to determine if mosquitos could get through wire gauze 16 meshes to the inch. He re-<lb/>
ported that stegomyia could not, and I then suggested that he repeat the experiment<lb/>
with pungens and anopheles when he protested humorously against having to work with<lb/>
such wild <hi>creatures which insisted on dying and did not have the charming docility<lb/>
of stegomyia</hi>.</p>
<p><hi>But the preservation of even this gentle insect had its difficulties, one of<lb/>
which was their liability to be devoured by a tiny red ant which was omnipresent<lb/>
in Cuba. I remember one big jar of infected mosquitos nearly ripe at Camp Lazear<lb/>
which were all devoured in one night in spite of jars of water under the legs of the<lb/>
table on which it sat</hi>. It was found that the cord of the window shade had been<lb/>
allowed to touch the table and had thus made a suspension bridge over which the ants<lb/>
had made their foray.</p>

<p>To Reed's mind the case of Dean reenforced by that of Carroll established the<lb/>
theory and his quick mind saw in a flash the vast importance of it. <hi>After the fate<lb/>
of Lazear and the experience of Carroll he hardly expected that new volunteers would<lb/>
be forthcoming. So in a visit to me at Gen. Lee's headquarters on Oct. 12th he told<lb/>
me that he was going to Havana next morning to ask General Wood's permission</hi> to go<lb/>
<hi>back to the United States, announce the discovery at the approaching meeting</hi> of the<lb/>
<hi>American Public Health Association and consult Gen. Sternberg on what should be the<lb/>
next step</hi>.</p>
<p>I told him I would drive him down in <del>the</del> General' <del>s</del><add>Lee,</add> carriage, and after we started<lb/>
<hi>unfolded to him a scheme which had occurred</hi> to me. <hi>This was that as all Spaniards<lb/>
when they came to Cuba landed with the expectation of getting yellow fever, it would<lb/>
not be difficult with the help of money to persuade them to have their attack by<lb/>
experimental inoculation. So Reed was to ask Gen. Wood for the money, and the quar-<lb/>
antine camps at <unclear><del>F</del><add>T</add>riscorn<add>ia</add></unclear> where Spanish immigrants were at that time detained for<lb/>
their own protection until they should get employment, was to furnish the Spaniards</hi>.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the faces of the two men <add>as</add> we stood in a window of the Palace<lb/>
at Havana looking out on the Plaza de Armas, and Reed with that lucidity and force of<lb/>
speech which was characteristic of him told his story while <hi>Gen. Wood listened grave<lb/>
impassive but alert. The two men knew each other well for Wood had taken a special<lb/>
course at this school under Reed only three years before when a Captain</hi> in the Medical<lb/>
Corps and assistant to the attending surgeon in this city. When Reed finished he<lb/>
looked at Gen. Wood a moment and then asked if the General would give him <del>the money</del><add>$10000</add> to<lb/>
employ Spaniards and continue the experiments. <hi>Instantly came the reply &ldquo;I will <del>you</del><add>give you</add><lb/>
<del><unclear>100</unclear> thousand dollars</del><add>the money</add> and if that is not enough I will give you $10<unclear><add>0</add></unclear>,000 more. I have<lb/>
today given a large sum for the secret service and this is certainly vastly of greater</hi><lb/>
importance to Cuba than the catching of a few rogues&rdquo;. <add>Take no men who are not<lb/>
sound in mind &amp; body and of legal age by the Spanish law&rdquo;.</add></p>
<p>We then went to lunch and I drank to a good voyage and to the great fame which<lb/>
would surely come to him. In less than three weeks he was <del>g</del><add>b</add>ack again and the money<lb/>
was placed by Gen. Wood's order to my credit <add>for disbursement</add> and we began to build the experiment<add>al</add></p>
<pb n="11" id="f06242012"/>
<p>10</p>
<p>station at Camp Lazear. From this point on I imagine the story is familiar to you all.</p>
<p><hi>The conversion of Gorgas to the new theory was complete by the first of February<lb/>
1901, and during that month he began to make practical application of it</hi> <del>.</del><add><hi rend="subscript">2</hi></add> In his<lb/>
sanitary report for the month of February which is dated March 6th he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;During February 1900 we had 17 cases of yellow fever, in Feb. of 1901 we had 8<lb/>
new cases. As the number of non-immunes was very much larger in Feb. of this<lb/>
than in that of last year I think the showing is encouraging. Besides disinfecting the<lb/>
houses with formaline and other disinfectants we <del>could</del> screen the rooms occupied by<lb/>
a yellow fever patient as soon as his case is reported and kill all the mosquitos in<lb/>
the building with fumes of pyrethrum powder, at the same time covering with kerosene<lb/>
oil all places where mosquitos can breed about the building. We also kill the mosquitos<lb/>
in all the adjoining buildings in the same way. With these measures and the steps we<lb/>
are taking to kill the mosquitos in the suburbs I hope to markedly decrease the yellow<lb/>
fever in the coming summer.</p>
<p>The history of yellow fever in Havana shows that in Jan. Feb. and March there is<lb/>
a gradual decrease, these cases being the a<del>l</del><add>f</add>termath of the preceding year, and after the<lb/>
first of April it begins to slowly increase again and so it was the custom of sanitarians<lb/>
to count the epidemic year for yellow fever to begin April 1st. It was then a very<lb/>
favorable time for Gorgas to begin his campaign when the number of mosquitos was at<lb/>
the minimum - and also the number of cases.</p>
<p>The method of work and the difficulties encountered are very well told in a report<lb/>
dated Dec. 29, 1901, of the work done by the Stegomyia Brigade during the 8 months<lb/>
since its organization - for very soon it was found necessary to divide the mosquito<lb/>
work into that of the Anopheles Brigade which operated in the suburbs and the Stegomyia<lb/>
Brigade which made house and back yard inspections. These separate organizations still<lb/>
operate in Havana. It may be of interest to know that Mr. Joseph A. Le Prince who<lb/>
wrote this report <del>when</del><add>is</add> with Col. Gorgas in Panama and is in charge of the mosquito<lb/>
work there today. (See Rep. p. 101, Vol. IV, 1901).<lb/>
11</p>
<p><hi rend="subscript">2</hi>But at first he did not expect much of it &amp; confesses in one report;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had very little hope of accomplishing much; it seemed to me that even<lb/>
if the mosquito did convey yellow fever, he could not be gotten rid of, and,<lb/>
apparently, from all past experience, the mosquito was not the only way, or<lb/>
even the principal way, of conveying the disease. But as he evidently could<lb/>
convey the disease, it was our duty to take precautions in this direction. . . .</p>
<pb n="12" id="f06242013"/>
<p>11</p>
<p>La Prince said</p>
<p>I have the honor to present herewith a brief report on the difficul-<lb/>
ties encountered, results obtained, and methods followed in reducing the<lb/>
number of mosquitoes in the City of Havana and its suburbs during the past<lb/>
eight months.</p>
<p>Previous to April, 1901, our Sanitary Inspectors made reports of those<lb/>
houses where larvae were found and such houses were subsequently visited<lb/>
and the deposits of water containing larvae were treated with petroleum.<lb/>
It soon became evident, however, that so many breeding places existed in<lb/>
the vicinity of the houses that it was found necessary to establish a spe-<lb/>
cial brigade to go over the City from house to house. The stegomyia bri-<lb/>
gade was started in April and was gradually enlarged to forty men.</p>
<p>As many parts of this city are without water supply the people store<lb/>
water in barrels, &ldquo;tinajones&rdquo;, cans, etc., etc., and it is in deposits of<lb/>
this character that the greater number of Stegomyia larvae are found. It<lb/>
might be mentioned also that even in the houses where city water is obtain-<lb/>
able water was kept stored in deposits.</p>
<p>Rain water being soft is kept in large quantities for washing pur-<lb/>
poses. Considering all these matters, it is not surprising to find that<lb/>
when we began our mosquito destruction work there was an average of one<lb/>
deposit of water containing larvae for every house in the City.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes were also breeding in many ditches and puddles and also<lb/>
in many wells, cisterns, tanks, &ldquo;Fosas Mouras&rdquo; and cess-pools, so it was<lb/>
quite natural that the number of mosquitoes in Havana should have been<lb/>
very large during past years.</p>
<p>Soon after the Stegomyia Brigade started we oiled all deposits of<lb/>
water which were being used and requested the people to keep petroleum<lb/>
on the surface of the water and draw water from the base of each vessel<lb/>
by means of a tap. This method, although it killed the larvae, was found<lb/>
to be impractical because a large number of people seemed afraid that the<lb/>
12<lb/>
<pb n="13" id="f06242014"/>
12.<lb/>
oil was poisonous and in many cases people skimmed the oil off and each<lb/>
heavy rain removed all the petroleum and spoiled our work.</p>
<p>Another plan had to be adopted. It was decided that two boards a<lb/>
foot wide and two feet long could be put together rapidly and nailed<lb/>
over each barrel, etc. In the center of the lid so made, a square hole<lb/>
8&Prime; &times; 8&Prime; was cut and over it was nailed a piece of wire gauze; such a lid<lb/>
was then ready to nail on the deposit and in a moment a hole could be<lb/>
made below to draw water from. Lids of this form were made in large num-<lb/>
bers and were nailed over the barrels belonging to the people in desti-<lb/>
tute circumstances. <hi>Also on May 25th the following order was issued and<lb/>
delivered at 26,000 houses</hi>:</p>
<p>HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF CUBA.</p>
<p>Office of Chief Sanitary Officer of Havana,</p>
<p>Notice to Tenants and Property Owners.</p>
<p>It is known that the yellow fever mosquito (Stegomyia) prefers to lay<lb/>
its eggs in clear and quiet waters, and in order to destroy this mosquito,<lb/>
the Sanitary Department has issued the following order:</p>
<p>The covers of all wells, cisterns, tanks or any other vessel that may<lb/>
at any time contain water shall be tightly covered in such a manner that<lb/>
they shall be mosquito proof. All small entrance or cracks shall be prop-<lb/>
erly covered or have wire gauze nailed over them. All cisterns and wells<lb/>
shall be supplied with pumps. All wells and cisterns not in use shall<lb/>
have their covers nailed down or shall be sealed.</p>
<p>Wherever barrels are used to contain water, they shall be supplied<lb/>
with a clost fitting cover and in the center of each such cover shall be<lb/>
left an opening about 6 inches square. This opening shall be covered with<lb/>
a piece of fine mosquito proof wire netting and will serve as entrance for<lb/>
water to be kept in the barrel. At the bottom of the barrel a tap shall<lb/>
be placed.</p>
<p>Hereafter no person shall be allowed to have barrels or other vessels<lb/>
containing water which are not mosquito proof.</p>
<p>The above order having been made a law, must be obeyed and any person<lb/>
violating the same will be held responsible.</p>
<p>Respectfully,<lb/>
(Signed) W. C. Gorgas,<lb/>
Major and Surgeon, U.S. Army,<lb/>
Chief Sanitary Officer.</p>
<p>Immediately following the distribution of this law the Brigades were<lb/>
ordered to break all non-mosquito-proof barrels containing water. Our<lb/>
13<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f06242015"/>
13.<lb/>
Stegomyia Brigade is composed of several divisions and each such division<lb/>
contains one foreman and two laborers who carry petroleum. The foreman en-<lb/>
ters a house, examines all parts of the yard, sees that the laborer who is<lb/>
with him puts the correct quantity of oil in each drain, fosa moura, sewer<lb/>
basin, pozo negro, etc., etc. He next goes up onto the balconies and roofs<lb/>
of the houses to see if any deposits of water exist there. This work is<lb/>
all absolutely necessary for there are many ignorant persons who persist in<lb/>
breeding mosquitoes. In fact, as a rule little sympathy and still less<lb/>
assistance is given to the mosquito work by the public in general. In<lb/>
some sections of the City until lately, as soon as one of our divisions<lb/>
appeared the tenants would lock up their deposits of water containing lar-<lb/>
vae in the rooms until the Brigades had passed. In order to remove such<lb/>
difficulties a list of names of all people who have deposits of water at<lb/>
present has been made, and inspections of these are being made at irregu-<lb/>
lar intervals and the owners are being fined when larvae are found on their<lb/>
premises. This method of procedure is producing excellent results. In the<lb/>
daily routine each foreman enters in his books a report of each deposit of<lb/>
water in non-mosquito-proof condition with the name of the owner thereof.<lb/>
By this means we obtain each week lists of all wells, cisterns, tanks, etc.,<lb/>
and orders are sent at once notifying owners to make same mosquito-proof.<lb/>
It has been found practical by this means and by the enforcement of the<lb/>
order previously mentioned to have all deposits of water made and kept<lb/>
mosquito proof, and a glance at the summary attached to this report will<lb/>
show what has been done. It has not been found practical to get assist-<lb/>
ance from house tenants and so they have been forced rather than persuaded<lb/>
to obey the orders of this Department. Eternal vigilance is necessary, for<lb/>
at one time we left one section of the city without inspection for a period<lb/>
14<lb/>
<pb n="15" id="f06242016"/>
14.<lb/>
of five weeks to see whether the house tenants were sufficiently interest-<lb/>
ed at present to keep their premises free from mosquitoes. It is sufficient<lb/>
to state that many new deposits of water with larvae were found and also that<lb/>
in nearly every case where we had helped people by covering their deposits<lb/>
said covers had been torn off or destroyed.</p>
<p>In November a notice was published in the papers that thereafter all<lb/>
persons having receptacles with water which is found to contain larvae, will<lb/>
be fined $10.00 U.S. currency for every violation of said law.</p>
<p>From the difficulties we have encountered it might be supposed that<lb/>
there has not been a large decrease in the number of mosquitoes in this<lb/>
City. This is not the case. In fact, we have been exceptionally success-<lb/>
ful in our work and we hear good reports from all parts. Today, there are<lb/>
many parts of this city where a hundred houses may be inspected one after<lb/>
another without encountering any mosquito larvae. When you consider that<lb/>
the average used to be one deposit per house exclusive of wells, cisterns,<lb/>
tanks, etc., and also the fact that there are very few people who try to<lb/>
assist us, then it is certainly gratifying to know that so much good work<lb/>
has been accomplished. Mosquitoes were very numerous in Havana last sum-<lb/>
mer and it was necessary to sleep under a mosquito bar every night. Our<lb/>
soldiers at the Punta used to burn smudge every night to drive the mosqui-<lb/>
toes out. This year these same men do not even use mosquito bars. We are<lb/>
receiving similar reports from different parts of the city. When a suspect<lb/>
case of yellow fever has occurred in this city the house of the patient and<lb/>
the adjacent houses are fumigated to kill any infected Stegomyia present,<lb/>
and all dead mosquitoes found are burned. It has been noticed that the num-<lb/>
ber of dead mosquitoes found after fumigating is decreasing and also that<lb/>
of those found the percentage of Stegomyia mosquitoes has decreased largely.<lb/>
15<lb/>
<pb n="16" id="f06242017"/>
15.<lb/>
This will have an effect in reducing the possibility of yellow fever<lb/>
patients being bitten. In our inspections I have found that the largest<lb/>
quantity of Stegomyia larvae are found in house yards in vessels contain-<lb/>
ing clear and still water. Even though water in pools contaminated with<lb/>
sewage were close at hand containing (culex pungens) larvae the Stegomyia<lb/>
seems to prefer the clearer water. There seems to be a popular impres-<lb/>
sion that mosquitoes will not breed in moving water, but in Havana we<lb/>
find them breeding in ditches and creeks which have considerable current<lb/>
and also in the troughs where animals drink. In several cases tanks have<lb/>
been found where water was running in at one end and out at the other and<lb/>
many larvae were found to be present. Such tanks have been ordered to be<lb/>
completely emptied twice a week or owner to be fined when larvae were found.<lb/>
Even the tubs into which blacksmiths put red hot irons daily were found<lb/>
to contain many larvae.</p>
<p>In this connection it may be of interest<lb/>
to know that I have <unclear>known</unclear> them to be found<lb/>
breeding in <unclear>Lye Hoppers</unclear> and in the<lb/>
the alkaline water which has received<lb/>
the Calcium Castride of Acetyline <unclear>affection</unclear><lb/>

there were 63 cases and 5 deaths.</p>
<p>The three last cases in Havana were taken<lb/>

no more cases in Havana, for 4 years and<lb/>
the disease disappeared from all Cuba at<lb/>
the same time - for nowhere else did there<lb/>
seem to be a sufficient supply of non-<lb/>
immunes to support a continuing infection.<lb/>
It was quite different as we shall see<add>,</add> when<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> I came to fight the disease five years later.</p>
<p>Gorgas' Report for the year 1901, ends with the following paragraph which <del>is a</del><add>has the</add><lb/>
<unclear>ie</unclear> of subdued exultation of a nunc dimittis:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is probably the last annual report that will be made by a United States Army<lb/>
<unclear>officer</unclear> as Health Officer of Havana, to his Military superior, the Governor of the Island<lb/>
I hope that I may be excused if I point out some of the sanitary differences between<lb/>
&ldquo;the then&rdquo; and &ldquo;the now&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Army took charge of the Health Department of Havana when deaths were occurring<lb/>
at the rate of 21,252 per year. It gives it up with deaths occurring at the rate of<lb/>
5,720 per year. It took charge with smallpox endemic for years. It gives it up with not<lb/>
a single case having occurred in the city for over eighteen months. It took charge with<lb/>
yellow fever endemic for two centuries, the relentless foe of every foreigner who came<lb/>
within Havana's borders,-which he could not escape, and from whose attack he well know<lb/>
that every fourth men must die. It found <hi>Havana feared as a thing unclean by all</hi> her<lb/>

In Havna, Cuba, <del>this disease</del><add>small pox</add> was likewise always present prior to<lb/>
the American occupation and in the eight years preceding 1899 it caused<lb/>
3123 deaths. Is that year a general vaccination of the population occur-<lb/>

seven years has been three.</p>

Havana and the United States. It leaves, after careful study of the question of yellow<lb/>
fever by its Officers, undeterred by personal risk,- for several of the investigators<lb/>
have died of the disease, contracted at their work. It has established the fact that<lb/>
yellow fever is only transmitted by a certain species of mosquito, a discovery that, in<lb/>
its power for saving human life, is only excelled by Jenner's great discovery, and as<lb/>
time goes on, it will stand in the same class as that great boon to mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another report he says:- &ldquo;I look forward in the future to a time<lb/>
when yellow fever will have entirely disappeared as a disease to which man-<lb/>
kind is subject, for I believe that when the yellow fever parasite has once<lb/>
become extinct it can no more return than the dodo or any other species<lb/>
of animal that has disappeared from the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope that you may all live to see<lb/>
this prediction verified.</p>
