Mr. Paul L. Tate<lb/>

Berkeley, California<lb/>
<salute>Dear Tate:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Just received your card and will answer right away. I am continuing<lb/>
to make very nice progress but it is terribly slow. I have been<lb/>
here now just over three months and I think the progress from here<lb/>
on should be more rapid. I still don't <unclear>dare</unclear> trust myself to use a<lb/>
cane because I am too weak to catch myself if I should start to fall,<lb/>
but that is the nature of this affliction of the spinal cord. The<lb/>
doctor finally decided that I had a slight hemorrhage in the anterior<lb/>
columns of the cord and feels that by this time the lesion should be<lb/>
pretty well resolved and that progress from here on should be more<lb/>
rapid.</p>
<p>While I have been here I have been reading Mrs. Standlee's manuscript<lb/>
regarding the history of the Walter Reed Hospital. The manuscript<lb/>
was so big and bulky that I could not lift it and I made no effort<lb/>
to read it myself, so Mrs. Truby read it to me while I was in bed.<lb/>
It has just been recently returned to her with the brief comments<lb/>
I could make on such an elaborate affair. I enjoyed it thoroughly<lb/>
although it could not be considered a factual story because practi-<lb/>
cally all of the information she has is from others, and therefore<lb/>
hearsay. Besides some of the people she quotes were not competent,<lb/>
in my opinion, to express the opinions they did. It was all hearsay.<lb/>
So, I think the whole story ought to be reviewed by some of the senior<lb/>
officers there at the Walter Reed. It could be a very creditable<lb/>
history if they can show by references that much of the data is<lb/>
factual.</p>
<p>Her chapter on yellow fever, as it was first written, brought out<lb/>
what I consider was discredited material about Carroll and Agramonte,<lb/>
especially Dr. Hammeter's wholly unreliable material about Carroll.<lb/>
The whole Corps was sore at Carroll at that time. I wrote her that<lb/>
and suggested that she leave out that chapter entirely and make a<lb/>
simple statement that that story is being written by Dr. Hench and<lb/>
that he has more factual information on the subject than anyone<lb/>
living. So, why try to do something that could not be done without<lb/>
great expense and study? Her revised copy which came with the manuscript<lb/>
was much improved but I still felt that I should stick to my first<lb/>
remarks and ask her to leave it out.</p>
<p>In one of Mrs. Standlee's letters she mentioned you and appreciated<lb/>
your interest in her book and was pleased with your comments.</p>
<p>I will probably be here a month or maybe more but as soon as I can<lb/>
walk with safety by myself I shall try to get back home. I have been<lb/>
busy with considerable correspondence to take care of and have not<lb/>
been able to write each of my friends except occasionally.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
