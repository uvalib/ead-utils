<salute>Dear Dr. Kelly:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Perhaps you may think there has been a rather long period<lb/>
of silence since I wrote you last. The truth is that the Kis-<lb/>
singer Campaign and my other work did me up, and for three<lb/>
months (December to February) I had all I could do to force<lb/>
myself through the motions of teaching school. I am in fine<lb/>
shape now, and I am trying my best to let &ldquo;George&rdquo; do most of<lb/>
this extra work that has come my way since Dr. Fosdick preached<lb/>
that wonderful sermon five weeks ago. I enclose some material<lb/>
that will give you some idea of the progress we have made. We<lb/>
now have in hand about $1300, certainly enough for any immediate<lb/>
needs of the Kissingers. We hope to get the little place for<lb/>
them in season for them to plant their garden.</p>
<p>I had to send you, during my illness, Mrs. Kissinger's appeal<lb/>
for help for her hospital expenses, and I received your kind<lb/>
answer. Enclosed is her latest answer to my questions, and my<lb/>
reply to her. I do not wish to seem to impose on you, but I<lb/>
know the interest you have already shown in the Kissingers, and<lb/>
we are all eager to have them enjoy a few years at least free<lb/>
from suffering and anxiety, if such a thing is possible. You<lb/>
see I have made bold to ask her to write you, even though you<lb/>
should find it impossible to give any advice at long range. If<lb/>
the doctors there only agreed, we could leave it to them. Any<lb/>
advice you can give will be most gratefully received by all of<lb/>
us.</p>
<p>We have rather a remarkable Citizens' Committee, don't you<lb/>
think. We had a meeting of our Biology Association Committee<lb/>
yesterday, and decided to memorialize every College and High<lb/>
School Biology Department we can reach in this Country, to the<lb/>
end that The Yellow Fever Story of Heroism may be taught widely<lb/>
before the end of this school year. In the Autumn we propose<lb/>
to storm Congress and to secure gold medals for all the survi-<lb/>
vors of those gruesome experiments or for their widows. We<lb/>
are sure we can count on you and Dr. Welch for ardent support.<lb/>
Will you please answer by special delivery, addressed to the<lb/>
school, giving us your advice relative to Mrs. Kissinger and our<lb/>
campaign.</p>
<p>Please give my regards to your good wife and to the sons and<lb/>
daughters I met. Our good friends the Tracy's enjoyed so much<lb/>
your Lenten Talks in Washington.</p>

<salute>Cordially and gratefully yours,</salute>
