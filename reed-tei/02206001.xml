<hi>Sunday</hi>.<lb/>
<salute>My sweet, sweet wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yester-<lb/>
day's mail brought two nice<lb/>
letters from the <hi>dearest</hi><lb/>
woman in this wide world,<lb/>
and one more letter from<lb/>
the most &ldquo;preciousest&rdquo; little<lb/>
daughter in the U.S - As<lb/>
I wrote to little daughter,<lb/>
I believe that I gave<lb/>
You the <hi>wrong</hi> days for<lb/>
writing your letters, and<lb/>
hence if they haven't come<lb/>
promptly, it was not<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02206002"/>
my sweet oomsey's fault!<lb/>
The boat leaves Tampa on<lb/>
Mondays, Wednesdays and<lb/>
Saturdays- Letters there-<lb/>
fore mailed in Washington<lb/>
<hi>before noon</hi> on <hi>Tuesdays</hi>,<lb/>
<hi>Thursdays</hi> &amp; <hi>Saturdays</hi> should<lb/>
come right through - day<lb/>
written the night preceding<lb/>
&amp; mailed early on the days<lb/>
given above - But, bless<lb/>
your sweet heart, don't<lb/>
bother your darling head<lb/>
about the days - Write<lb/>
just when you get ready<lb/>
and your old Mantee<lb/>
will get <del>it</del> <add>them</add> after awhile.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02206003"/>
Just as a <hi>pointer</hi>, however,<lb/>
lovie your letter written<lb/>
on Tuesday the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; Post-<lb/>
marked 9 P.M Washington<lb/>
reached me on the morning<lb/>
of the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, and your letter<lb/>
postmarked <hi>Sunday</hi> 7.30 P.M.<lb/>
came at the same time; in<lb/>
other words <hi>Sunday's</hi> letter<lb/>
was <hi>too</hi> late for <del>Saturdays</del><lb/>
boat leaving on Monday night<lb/>
&amp; which got here last<lb/>
wednesday- write, there-<lb/>
fore, sweet joy, on Tuesdays<lb/>
Thursdays &amp; Saturdays,<lb/>
and I shall be quite satisfied.<lb/>
I <hi>thought</hi> from the tempera-<lb/>
tures here that you must<lb/>
be having it <hi>cold</hi> in the<lb/>
U.S- Certainly the owner<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02206004"/>
will see that Miss Mason's<lb/>
house is well heated.<lb/>
It wouldn't do at all for<lb/>
her to give it up, this win-<lb/>
ter- She had better hang<lb/>
right on to it till spring,<lb/>
for the winter may be very<lb/>
mild after <add>all</add>- Here, at pres-<lb/>
ent, it is simply, lovely<lb/>
June weather- The thermom<lb/>
eter was 76&deg; at breakfast<lb/>
time, this morning, and if the<lb/>
breeze wasn't blowing, it<lb/>
would now be disagreeably<lb/>
warm- I guess that we<lb/>
will have all of the warm<lb/>
weather we want for the<lb/>
propagation of our mosquitoes.<lb/>
By searching around in this<lb/>
immediate neighborhood we<lb/>
have been able to find<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02206005"/>
all the Culex fasciatus we<lb/>
want. Work on our camp<lb/>
is going along rapidly, and<lb/>
my experimental houses<lb/>
will soon be completed.<lb/>
We already have eight in-<lb/>
dividuals who are willing<lb/>
and anxious to undergo<lb/>
any experiments that we<lb/>
desire to subject them to.<lb/>
We will put them in camp <add>tomorrow</add><lb/>
&amp; keep <add><del>tomorrow</del></add> them there for 7<lb/>
days before we under-<lb/>
take any work with them.<lb/>
We ought thus to be able<lb/>
to arrive at some final and<lb/>
positive results. Dr Ames<lb/>
will have charge of the<lb/>
experimental station and no<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02206006"/>
unauthorized person will<lb/>
be allowed near the camp.<lb/>
Don't worry about any<lb/>
exposure on my part, for<lb/>
I shall do nothing in con-<lb/>
nection with the camp.<lb/>
My work is to get the station<lb/>
completed and properly e-<lb/>
quipped, &amp; then I shall con-<lb/>
fine myself to Labora-<lb/>
tory work. Dr Kean is<lb/>
invaluable to me - he is<lb/>
really the quartermaster<lb/>
of the camp &amp; is doing every-<lb/>
thing to bring about<lb/>
a successful issue to<lb/>
our work- He will re-<lb/>
main here as Post Surg-<lb/>
eon &amp; has already taken<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02206007"/>
quarters in the Post-<lb/>
Dr &amp; Mrs. Stark will re-<lb/>
main here certainly<lb/>
till January 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> &amp; then<lb/>
probably go to the states.<lb/>
Wednesday afternoon last<lb/>
Mrs. Kean &amp; Mrs. Stark gave<lb/>
a very pretty progressive<lb/>
Euchre party which was<lb/>
quite a success. Everybody<lb/>
in the garrison was there<lb/>
and we enjoyed ourselves<lb/>
very much. As the guests<lb/>
arrived, each was handed<lb/>
a delicious mint-Julep<lb/>
which my sweet wifie<lb/>
would have enjoyed very<lb/>
much- It was a little <hi>heady</hi>.<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02206008"/>
while I playing away at one<lb/>
of the tables, I felt a slap on<lb/>
my <del>soldier</del> <add>shoulder</add>, &amp; heard someone<lb/>
say, &ldquo;Excuse me, Major, I was<lb/>
only killing a <hi>Mosquito</hi>&rdquo;!<lb/>
Looking up, I found that<lb/>
it was Gen. Lee who was<lb/>
passing by- He is very full<lb/>
of fun- The General left<lb/>
Havana on yesterday, re-<lb/>
ceiving quite an ovation<lb/>
on his departure- We were<lb/>
all so sorry to see him go-<lb/>
and shall miss him very much.<lb/>
Thursday night quite a brilliant<lb/>
ball was given by the<lb/>
7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Cav. in his honor - The<lb/>
hall is very large and the<lb/>
decorations with the royal<lb/>
palm leaves was very beautiful.<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02206009"/>
<hi>Monday morning: Nov. 19</hi>. I am very<lb/>
sorry that my sweet &ldquo;oomsey<del>e</del>&rdquo;<lb/>
wasn't feeling very well when<lb/>
she wrote- Folks will have<lb/>
pain sometimes in their &ldquo;Tum-<lb/>
my's&rdquo;-! I think that you may<lb/>
well say that you wouldn't<lb/>
trust any thing a certain<lb/>
individual <hi>with many wives</hi><lb/>
should say! Wasn't that per-<lb/>
fectly dreadful? Don't inti-<lb/>
mate any opinion you may<lb/>
have to Miss Carrie- Please<lb/>
give her my love. <hi>Of course</hi>,<lb/>
<hi>you Miss me</hi>, lovie, dear!<lb/>
Why shouldn't you? But just<lb/>
take care of your darling<lb/>
self and take care of smart<lb/>
little scholar, and your old Mr<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02206010"/>
Mantee will come jogging back<lb/>
after awhile; and <hi>we will<lb/>
go up together to dear Kee-<lb/>
waydin</hi> &amp; your dream shall<lb/>
be realized - Many thanks<lb/>
for the clipping you sent-<lb/>
I was quite interested in it.<lb/>
I have received a number<lb/>
of clippings from the N.Y. man-<lb/>
Some unfavorable, but the major-<lb/>
ity commendatory- I send a<lb/>
short cutting from Havana Post<lb/>
of yesterday- Never mind about<lb/>
the newspapers, lovie, dear, or<lb/>
what people don't say - I had<lb/>
rather for it to not be spoken<lb/>
of just now- We hope soon to<lb/>
settle the matter finally. The<lb/>
Postman is Coming. Good-bye-<lb/>
Kisses &amp; love &amp; love &amp; kisses<lb/>
for my sweet, sweet girls-</p>
