Mr. George A. Kellogg,<lb/>
257 Cornelison Avenue<lb/>
Jersey City, N J.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Kellogg:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I pray you will not take the delay in acknowledging<lb/>
your kind letter of July 24, sending us the reproduction in<lb/>
color of Mr. Cornwell's find painting &ldquo;The Conquerors of<lb/>
Yellow Fever&rdquo;. We were in Richmond, Virginia, on a visit to<lb/>
my son and no mail was sent to us while there. When I re-<lb/>
turned on the 29th I was sick and went from the automobile<lb/>
to my bed from which I arose this morning feeling well enough<lb/>
to drive a pen.</p>
<p>Mr. Cornwell has made a most interesting and striking<lb/>
group and has been more successful than I would have thought<lb/>
possible in bringing so many figures together in a natural<lb/>
and easy grouping. I don't think my face was ever round and<lb/>
am quite satisfied with it. My friend <hi>Truby</hi> did have a round<lb/>
smooth face with a pleasing expression and no prominence of<lb/>
check bones. I think that Major Reed is excellent--his face has<lb/>
the look of intentness which was characteristic of him but<lb/>
without the scowl which has sometimes been given him. He. and<lb/>
Dr. Finlay are the most important figure in the group. As you<lb/>
know, I did not favor my inclusion or Truby's and General Wood's<lb/>
in the group, but I can see that I was too factual-minded for the<lb/>
most effective artistic results.</p>
<p>You may be interested to learn that the first letter<lb/>
we opened referring to it was from Mrs. Leonard Wood, the widow<lb/>
of Major Gen. Leonard Wood, written from his birthplace at<lb/>
Pocasset, Mass. which belongs to their daughter, Luisita (who<lb/>
was born in the Governor General's palace in Havana.) She<lb/>
seemed much pleased with it. If Mr. Cornwell is assailed with<lb/>
the comment that Kean had no right to be there, he can say with<lb/>
truth that the Sec'ty of War, in his annual report for 1900-1<lb/>
in mentioning this episode, commended Carroll and Kean in the<lb/>
same sentence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kean joins me in thanking you for remembering<lb/>
us in this pleasant way and we both wish to be remembered to<lb/>
Robin.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute>
<signed>(signed) J. R. Kean</signed>
<seg>
P.S. July 31, 1941. This is a P.S. to my letter of today's date to say that my commendation<lb/>
for the yellow fever work was in the report of Elihu Root, Sec'ty of War for the f.y.1901-02<lb/>
which I think is a year later than the date I gave in my <unclear>leter</unclear>. Please make the correction.<lb/>
