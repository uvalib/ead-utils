<p>Respectfully returned to the<lb/>
Chief Surgeon, Department of<lb/>
Cuba.</p>
<p>With regard to the conversa-<lb/>
tion between Mrs. Lena Warner<lb/>
and her Commanding Officer on<lb/>
March 19, 1902, I have no know-<lb/>
ledge. My only interview with<lb/>
her on the subject of doing out-<lb/>
side duty was shortly after I<lb/>
became Post Surgeon in March,<lb/>
1901, when I asked her to go<lb/>
over and spend the night with<lb/>
the wife of an Officer who was<lb/>
ill and alone, the officer being<lb/>
absent on duty. This request<lb/>
was refused. Next day I called<lb/>
together the trained nurses and<lb/>
told them that thereafter when<lb/>
emergencies arose in officers'<lb/>
families, I would expect them<lb/>
to share the responsability which<lb/>
I, as the Medical Officer, had<lb/>
in the care of these cases, and<lb/>
attend them if necessary; that<lb/>
if any nurse objected to this I<lb/>
might ask for her transfer to<lb/>
another post where the Post Sur-<lb/>
geon would be less exacting. At<lb/>
this interview all the nurses<lb/>
expressed a willingness to go<lb/>
and attend cases in the service<lb/>
where I deemed emergency to ex-<lb/>
ist. My reason for taking this<lb/>
stand was that in case of the oc-<lb/>
currence of an epedemic disease<lb/>
among the female members of an<lb/>
Original not passed through records.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02610002"/>
<del>3</del>2<lb/>
officer's or soldier's family, it<lb/>
would be manifestly my duty as<lb/>
Post Surgeon to see that the case<lb/>
had proper attention and it would<lb/>
also be manifestly impossible to<lb/>
have the case attended to by the<lb/>
enlisted men of the Hospital Corps<lb/>
I exercised this authority in one<lb/>
instance thereafter, sending a<lb/>
nurse to care for a child sick in<lb/>
with diptheria in the family of<lb/>
a soldier, the mother being at<lb/>
the time on the eve of confine-<lb/>
ment. This action was taken by<lb/>
order of the Chief Surgeon, but<lb/>
I would have been perfectly wil-<lb/>
ling to have assumed the responsi-<lb/>
bility therefor.</p>
<p>FROM GEN. J.R. KEAN</p>
<p>Under my observation, Mrs.<lb/>
Warner was not very desirous either<lb/>
to do hard work or incur any un-<lb/>
necessary risks. I do not recall<lb/>
an occasion upon which her ser-<lb/>
vices for outside work were de-<lb/>
sired when it was possible to<lb/>
secure another nurse at any price.</p>
