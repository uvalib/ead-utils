L<lb/>
Dr. Howard A. Kelly,<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir and Kind Friend:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yours received this A.M., and<lb/>
words cannot tell how happy it makes us to receive the<lb/>
amount you send us, we have worked so hard to keep things up.</p>
<p>Mr. Kissinger cried like a child when I handed him the<lb/>
check, we certainly thank you and wish you to thank the other<lb/>
kind friends for us that have taken the interest in us. This<lb/>
morning not 20 minutes before the mail man called, I was<lb/>
looking at your picture which we keep on our sittingroom<lb/>
table, and I wondered why we had not heard from you, not for<lb/>
the money's sake, but for friendship sake, because we both<lb/>
feel that you have been a good kind friend to us. My circum-<lb/>
stances have not always been quite so poor, but my parents<lb/>
are both dead and have only strangers and acquaintances for<lb/>
friends and advisers, but the Lord is my best Friend, I can<lb/>
go to him when all others fail, oh, what a comfort. As Mr<lb/>
Kissinger's health doesn't improve my kind friend Jennie Wilson<lb/>
who is an invalid at South Whittley and through other<lb/>
friends, have sent Mr. Kissinger a wheel chair, self-propelling<lb/>
it hasn't come yet, but he watches for it anxiously. The<lb/>
one he has I had to push by the back.</p>
<p>Wishing to thank you again, we will remain your<lb/>
true friends and well wishers,</p>
<closer>
<signed>Mr. &amp; Mrs. John R. Kissinger</signed>.
(We now have on hand $165.50, beside the check for $100<lb/>
and a check which was drawn to Kissinger's own name for $5)<lb/>

<p>feels so badly at times I think he will<lb/>
not last long then he has such a will<lb/>
Power he cant give up now Dear Dr<lb/>
we have talked to a very Dear friend<lb/>
and business man and he said he<lb/>
would look up something for us and<lb/>
do all he could for us and we<lb/>
are certain he will for he has<lb/>
been very much Intrested in our<lb/>
well fare</p>
<p>I have Rheumatism in my hands my<lb/>
joints are just as sore as can be having<lb/>
them in the cold water so much we<lb/>
would certainly be very glad to do<lb/>
something else this winter and am<lb/>
sure we will try faithfully for at<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02926019"/>
now to thank you and Other Intrested<lb/>
friends for these and your kindness<lb/>
and hoping this will meet with your<lb/>
approval we beg to remain your<lb/>
true friends and well wisher's<lb/>
