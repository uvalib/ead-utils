FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY<lb/>

Superintendent.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Latimer:--</salute>
</opener>
<p>In accordance with your request, I write to give<lb/>
you some impressions of Dr. Walter Reed.</p>
<p>When the Hospital first opened, but before the establishment<lb/>
of the Medical School, it was customary for us to receive physicians<lb/>
who had graduated in medicine elsewhere for ward instruction and for<lb/>
laboratory courses. One day, about 1890, Dr. Reed came to me and said<lb/>
that he had been detailed by Surgeon General Baxter to come to Baltimore<lb/>
partly to attend to certain duties at Fort McHenry, but mainly to prepare<lb/>
himself for his examination and promotion by the opportunities afforded<lb/>
here for study. He very modestly asked me what he had better do, and I<lb/>
advised him as well as I could. I suggested that he take courses in<lb/>
pathology and bacteriology, in addition to certain clinical courses in<lb/>
general medicine and surgery. He seemed much interested, but said un-<lb/>
fortunately the Surgeon General had forbidden him to give any attention<lb/>
to laboratory work, and had informed him curtly and pointedly that <add>his</add> <del>the</del><lb/>
object in detailing him to come here was that he might better familiar-<lb/>
ize himself with the care of sick soldiers. Under the circumstances he<lb/>
felt that he could not in honor pursue any laboratory courses. He be-<lb/>
gan to take clinical courses here and continued for some weeks, but<lb/>
upon the sudden death of Surgeon General Baxter, after securing the<lb/>
permission of the new Surgeon General, he devoted himself to laboratory<lb/>
courses in pathology and bacteriology, and soon was known as one of our<lb/>

best and most industrious workers. From this time on, as long as he<lb/>
remained in Baltimore, I saw much of him and was always impressed<lb/>
with his keenness of mind and his intense interest in the scientific<lb/>
branches of medicine. Ever after, whenever he came to Baltimore, he<lb/>
usually came to the Hospital.</p>
<p>The summer before his death, I met him on his way to Monterey,<lb/>
where he had a summer cottage, and had a long conversation with him<lb/>
about his work. He was especially interested in the typhoid fever in-<lb/>
vestigation, <add>carried on by a Committee of which he was a member</add> and its connection with flies as carriers of contagion. He<lb/>
also spoke at length of his work upon the causation of yellow fever,<lb/>
especially the mosquito theory. I do not know how far this should be<lb/>
published. He said to me, however, that before he went to Cuba he had<lb/>
a long conference with Surgeon General Sternberg as to the lines of in-<lb/>
vestigation of yellow fever. He suggested to General Sternberg that it<lb/>
might be well to study the role of the mosquito in connection with the<lb/>
development of yellow fever, and that General Sternberg said &ldquo;No; that<lb/>
has already been decided to be a useless investigation.&rdquo; Subsequently,<lb/>
however, when all other leads had failed, and the investigation seemed<lb/>
destined to be fruitless, his thoughts recurred to the mosquito theory<lb/>
and, in connection with Doctors Lazear and Carroll, he initiated the<lb/>
experiments which resulted in the brilliant discovery.</p>
<p>I was much impressed, in this last conversation which I held<lb/>
with him, with his enthusiasm and devotion to his scientific work. He<lb/>
told me an incident which at that time made a strong impression upon<lb/>

me: How that, when it was known in Cuba that volunteers were desired<lb/>
who would submit to the inoculation by mosquitoes <add>infected by yellow fever</add>, two young men, pri-<lb/>
vates in the Army, came to him and volunteered to submit to the experi-<lb/>
ments. He talked with them rather fully and explained to them the<lb/>
dangers and difficulties, and also added that a definite money compen-<lb/>
sation would be paid to them. Both young men declined to receive the<lb/>
money and said that their only object was to further scientific investi-<lb/>
gation, whereupon Dr. Reed said, raising his hat respectfully, &ldquo;I take<lb/>
off my hat to you, gentlemen&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was evident to all who saw him during the last two years of<lb/>
his life, that he was very much worn by his scientific labors, but it<lb/>
was also evident that he felt most keenly the attempts which were made<lb/>
by persons high in authority to rob him of his just fame for the work<lb/>
which he had done. Personally, he was tall, somewhat slender, erect<lb/>
in bearing and graceful in carriage. He was cordial and courteous in<lb/>
manner, and instinctively made friends of all who came in contact with<lb/>
him.</p>
<p>I think this is about what Dr. Kelly desired to know. If any<lb/>
additions are needed, I will gladly make them.</p>

     P. S. I am afraid you have not received the money for the last<lb/>
book reviews. Miss Spicer will count them up, and the payment will be<lb/>
made at once.
