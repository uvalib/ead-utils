Mrs. Roger Post Ames,<lb/>

Atlanta, Georgia.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Madam:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In compliance with the request contained in your<lb/>
letter of October 25, 1929, you are furnished the following<lb/>
information concerning your husband, the late Major Roger Post<lb/>
Ames:- He was sent to Havana, where he remained from April 25,<lb/>
1899, to November, 1901. As it was known that he had had exper-<lb/>
ience in the diagnosis and treatment of yellow fever, his services<lb/>
in Cuba were much in demand in the care of cases of this disease,<lb/>
especially during the year 1900, when yellow fever was epidemic<lb/>
in Havana and the neighboring town of Marianao.</p>
<p>Regarding his connection with the work of the Yellow<lb/>
Fever Board, at the head of which was Major Walter Reed, the<lb/>
records show that he was on duty at Camp Lazear, the experimental<lb/>
camp established by the Board, from the date of its establishment,<lb/>
November 20, 1900, until February 28, 1901, on which date the<lb/>
camp was discontinued.</p>
<p>He resided at the camp and visited the patients who<lb/>
became ill of experimental yellow fever and who were immediately<lb/>
transferred from the camp to the yellow fever ward at Camp Colum-<lb/>
bia Hospital, a distance of about a mile. His work at the camp<lb/>
was both administrative in his being in charge of the soldiers<lb/>
and civilians (Spaniards) at the camp, and professional in that<lb/>
he looked after those who were taken sick. He performed his<lb/>
duties with skill, attention and fidelity.</p>
<p>While there is no record of any publication filed in<lb/>
his name relative to the progress and science of medicine, it is<lb/>
evident that during his service in Cuba he contributed much to<lb/>
the comfort, well-being and safety of his patients. His record<lb/>
in the Army is one that his family can view with legitimate pride<lb/>
and satisfaction.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>

Major General,<lb/>
The Adjutant General</signed>.
