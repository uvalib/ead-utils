<salute>My Commandante Mio</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yours of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> came two<lb/>
days ago, and before answer-<lb/>
ing it I determined to tackle<lb/>
the General for news and<lb/>
advice- There were various things<lb/>
which I wanted to ask him<lb/>
and then I think it is just as<lb/>
well to consult him &amp; make<lb/>
him feel that we regard him<lb/>
as thoroughly committed to our<lb/>
side, So when I went to him<lb/>
this morning I went direct to<lb/>
the Palace and by good luck<lb/>
caught him on the fly as he<lb/>
came into his office after<lb/>
breakfast- I first asked him<lb/>
if he were going with, &amp; he said<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02602002"/>
<hi>2</hi><lb/>
no, not unless he were ordered<lb/>
and as he had done all he<lb/>
could in the tariff matter<lb/>
he did not expect to be-<lb/>
Then I told him about Lagarde<lb/>
&amp; his biscuit backing- He<lb/>
replied that Lagarde was not<lb/>
in it &amp; <unclear>Westins</unclear> influence in<lb/>
this matter was over-rated-<lb/>
He went in to say that he thought<lb/>
the matter lay with the Secy<lb/>
who by the way way <add>is</add> quite familiar<lb/>
with the work of your board &amp;<lb/>
regarded it very highly -- and<lb/>
if they came down into the major<lb/>
that he thought you would<lb/>
get it- He brought up Havard<lb/>
&amp; said he told him that he<lb/>
was going to try to get you<lb/>
appointed, but if he found<lb/>
that they had determined not<lb/>
to appoint a major but one of<lb/>
the older men, then he would<lb/>
support him Havard- He said<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02602003"/>
3/<lb/>
this with an air of perfect straight forwardness &amp;<lb/>
louder and I would bet my head it is just<lb/>
what he did say- He went on to say that Mr.<lb/>
Root was especially anxious to find adminis-<lb/>
trative ability and said that (in substance) the<lb/>
administration did not want to get hold of<lb/>
another George M. He asked me if I thought<lb/>
you had administrative ability, to which I<lb/>
replied that you had always done every thing<lb/>
you undertook thoroughly well, and I believed<lb/>
that you were able to tackle any proposition which<lb/>
came along- Then I asked him what use you<lb/>
should make of your professional &amp; scientific<lb/>
backing &amp; whether the &ldquo;no influence&rdquo; pronunciamento<lb/>
meant anything- That is all talk he said and<lb/>
meant to keep off jack asses like Ayres &amp; c, but that<lb/>
the Secy &amp; the President had to consult the opin-<lb/>
ions of those who knew candidates, as in no<lb/>
other way could they know about them- He said<lb/>
that it would do much good to get Welch and<lb/>
Osler and especially any prominent men in the<lb/>
profession who knew the Secy to go and see him<lb/>
and see the President too, and if the thing were<lb/>
neatly &amp; tactfully done, &amp; the Secy was told who<lb/>
they were it would be a strong card- He said<lb/>
they should write too stating how your work was<lb/>
regarded by the profession, &amp; asking to have their<lb/>
letters made of record- So much for my<lb/>
interview and I came away much encouraged<lb/>
and elated-</p>
<p>Well I wish I could have seen foxy Aleck trying<lb/>
to pump you with his congratulations- He is a sly bird<lb/>

and doubtless gave OR a<lb/>
faithful -- or rather a full report<lb/>
of all that you said and<lb/>
several things that you did<lb/>
not say- This sounds very<lb/>
ill-natured &amp; as if I disliked<lb/>
<unclear>I.</unclear> which is not the case<lb/>
as he is a most entertaining<lb/>
cuss &amp; I do have a sneaking<lb/>
fondness for him in spite<lb/>
of his being such a facile<lb/>
liar- He has been working<lb/>
the OReilly boom for a year.</p>
<p>By the way Commandante<lb/>
there is an alleged Sanitary<lb/>
Congress to meet here next<lb/>
month, and while I dont<lb/>
believe that it will amount<lb/>
to much it will be a good<lb/>
excuse for you to run down<lb/>
to Cuba to see your friends<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02602005"/>
and satisfy that Viking love of yours for the<lb/>
sea- I am going to write to Uncle George<lb/>
Miller on various topics tomorrow such as<lb/>
a post for next fall &amp; to ask him to appoint<lb/>
me a delegate to the Assn Military Surgeons<lb/>
next June -- and I think I will take the<lb/>
liberty to suggest that as I am neither an<lb/>
Eminent Scientist like you or an Eminent Sanita-<lb/>
rian <add>like</add> Gorgas that he appoint you in my<lb/>
place -- that is if you wish to come-<lb/>
You should take a last glympse of Cuba<lb/>
as we will leave it -- and you should also<lb/>
press home the lessons which you gave with<lb/>
such telling effect at Buffalo- Gorgas thinks<lb/>
you ought to be here, and we agreed today<lb/>
that it would be rare sport if we could get<lb/>
you &amp; Col. H. into a 16-foot ring with a<lb/>
large pain of <unclear>brogans</unclear> in the middle!<lb/>
This is that sly Gorgas' suggestion- I have too<lb/>
much respect for my elders and betters to<lb/>
make a jest of their proper and honorable<lb/>
aspirations! well goodbye &amp; good luck to you<lb/>
my champion- marshall your fellow E.S.s and<lb/>
march on to victory -- and look not back after<lb/>
putting your hand to the plough! There is<lb/>
surely a mixed culture of metaphors for you-<lb/>
How is old Carroll- I am busy as the deuce getting<lb/>
ready to turn over my Dept.</p>
