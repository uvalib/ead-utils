Dr. Pedro Nogueira<lb/>
Marti 219, Marianao<lb/>
Havana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Pedro:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am delighted with the progress of your plans. I am particularly happy<lb/>
that the patrons of the project have seen fit to preserve the name Camp<lb/>
Lazear and Building No. 1.</p>
<p>According to present plans, I will fly down the night of Sunday, November<lb/>
30 and will arrive early Monday morning, on the plane from Miami. I will<lb/>
let you know the exact hour later. I think the plane arrives between<lb/>
7 and 8 a.m. I hate to have you bother to come to the airport but I leave<lb/>
that up to you as I know your welcoming nature.</p>
<p>I am working on my little talk. I will stay within the eight to ten minute<lb/>
time limit. If at all possible, I will send it to you even before I leave<lb/>
here. Otherwise I will bring some copies with me and will have it trans-<lb/>
lated into Spanish here so as to save you time. Rest assured, Pedro, that<lb/>
there will be nothing contentious in my talk. I will merely pay my homage<lb/>
to Finlay and Delgado and then in turn to the members of the Reed Commis-<lb/>
sion, pointing out that they made together a magnificent team and a wonder-<lb/>
ful contribution to humanity. If, when you see my talk you, knowing the<lb/>
Cuban temperament as you do, think I should change a word here or a sentence<lb/>
there, I shall be happy to have your suggestions.</p>
<p>My colleagues of the Mayo Clinic are most interested in the dedication.<lb/>
Therefore I am coming to Cuba not as a personal individual but as a repre-<lb/>
sentative of the Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation. The Mayo Foundation would<lb/>
like to honor Doctor Finlay and have authorized me, if it is consistent with<lb/>
your thinking and planning of the program, to place a wreath beneath the<lb/>
medallion of Finlay, perhaps during the ceremony. Would that be appropriate?<lb/>
It could be either during the ceremony, and only take a minute, or if this<lb/>
interruption seems inappropriate I could place it before the ceremony. How-<lb/>
ever I think it might be nicer if it would be possible for me to do it during<lb/>
the ceremony. Again, I will abide by the decision of yourself and your col-<lb/>
leagues.</p>
<p>I have just had a disturbing letter from Hanberry saying that he has decided<lb/>
he cannot go to Cuba, partly because of his advanced age and partly because<lb/>
of finances. I don't know whether he has heard from you, but at your sug-<lb/>
gestion I wrote him, telling him that he would be receiving a special in-<lb/>
vitation from you and hinting that at least his expenses would be paid by<lb/>
his Cuban hosts. I remember when he came to Washington he was attended by<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04509037"/>
Dr. Pedro Nogueira<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>

a young nephew. Perhaps he is &ldquo;afraid&rdquo; to travel alone. Perhaps this<lb/>
declining of your invitation is temporary and perhaps he could still be<lb/>
persuaded to come if his Cuban hosts could afford to have a young relative<lb/>
come with him to take care of him. As he is the only surviving volunteer<lb/>
his presence would add much to the ceremony. I wired him yesterday, asking<lb/>
him to tell me frankly whether he could go if a relative attended him. I<lb/>
made no commitments as far as expenses were concerned.</p>
<p>Lambert has moved from the address I gave you. Hanberry has given me the<lb/>
new address which is as follows: Mr. Gust E. Lambert, 17092 Lincoln Street,<lb/>
Hazel Crest, Illinois. I have written him also, asking him to get in touch<lb/>
with you directly and to send you a glossy photograph.</p>
<p>Pedro, I fear that I have been inefficient in helping you and should have<lb/>
sent you a much larger list of Americans to whom official invitations<lb/>
should have been sent. I have hardly ever been as busy in my life as I<lb/>
have been the last three months, hence my preoccupation and my imperfect<lb/>
help to you, for which I apologize.</p>
<p>The names of other important personages and individuals in this country who<lb/>
will be greatly interested in the dedication of Camp Lazear, and to whom<lb/>
invitations should be sent I give you herewith. I leave it to you and your<lb/>
colleagues whether they should be sent. It is still not too late, providing<lb/>
they are sent air mail and it may well be that some of these people will<lb/>
come in person or that the institutions will send representatives.</p>

<p>It has occurred to me belatedly that much American friendship toward Cuba<lb/>
and Doctor Finlay can be engendered by inviting the deans of the medical<lb/>
schools from which the yellow fever &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; or personalities obtained their<lb/>
medical degrees.</p>
<list type="simple">
<item>Dr. George A. Bennett, Dean of Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia<lb/>
Pennsylvania, from which Doctor Finlay received his medical<lb/>
degree in 1855.</item>
<item>Dr. Vernon W. Lippard, Dean of the Medical School, University of Virginia,<lb/>
Charlottesville, Virginia, from which Walter Reed obtained his<lb/>
first medical degree in 1869, General Kean received his medical<lb/>
degree in 1883 and which Johnny Moran attended.</item>
<item>Dr. Currier McEwen, Dean of the Bellevue Medical Center, New York<lb/>
University, 477 First Avenue, New York, New York, from which<lb/>
Reed obtained his second medical degree in 1870.</item>
<item>Dr. H. Boyd Wylie, Dean of the Medical School, University of Maryland,<lb/>
Baltimore, Maryland, from which Doctor Carroll received his<lb/>
degree in 1891.</item>
<item>Dr. Willard C. Rappleye, Dean of the Medical School (College of Physicians<lb/>
and Surgeons) Columbia University, New York City, from which<lb/>
Doctors Agramonte and Lazear both received their medical degree<lb/>
in 1892 and General Sternberg in 1860.</item>
<item>Dr. George P. Berry, Dean of the Medical School, Harvard University,<lb/>
Boston, Massachusetts, from which General Wood received his<lb/>
medical degree in 1884.</item>
</list></item></list></p>
<p>I do think that these institutions would greatly appreciate an official<lb/>
invitation and if they cannot send someone, some of them may at least have<lb/>
medical or non-medical alumni living in Havana who might attend.</p>
<p>Pedro, could you save for me and either send to me here or give me in Havana,<lb/>
about 50 invitations that I may send to the surviving relatives of other<lb/>
yellow fever volunteers and other Americans greatly interested in the con-<lb/>
quest of yellow fever.</p>
<p>I am anxious to know from what institution Doctor Delgado received his medi-<lb/>
cal degree. It is difficult to find anything about him. Could you send me<lb/>
this information?</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the photographs which arrived this morning. They are<lb/>
wonderful to have. Also, I am greatly relieved that you were able to use<lb/>
some of the old wood and that you have saved some of the rest of it for me<lb/>
to bring back for souvenirs. I am making arrangements with the U. S. Customs<lb/>
so that it can be shipped to me without difficulty.</p>

<p>Do you need a title for my little talk at the dedication? Will it be used<lb/>
on a program? If it is too late to send you a title and yet my name is to<lb/>
appear, perhaps you can merely say &ldquo;Remarks - - Dr. P. S. Hench, Mayo<lb/>
Foundation.&rdquo; By the way, is President Batista coming?</p>
<p>I will be delighted to stay over for the ceremony in the Academy of Science<lb/>
at 9 p.m., Wednesday evening, December 3, for which I shall bring my<lb/>
dinner jacket and Finlay Decoration. General Streit telephoned me, and<lb/>
is looking forward with enthusiasm to the Cuban visit.</p>
