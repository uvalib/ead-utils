Report re dengue.<lb/>

<salute>Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>As directed by Bureau orders (J.C.P.) of September 3, 1918, I<lb/>
have the honor to submit the following report on the outbreak of dengue<lb/>
prevailing here.</p>
<p>1) I have seen seven patients the <hi>clinical</hi> findings of any three<lb/>
of whom would have justified the diagnosis of Dengue. On none of them had<lb/>
a leucocyte count been made and the diagnosis <add>is</add> based on the history of the<lb/>
attack, such temperature records as are available and the eruption. This<lb/>
was seen in four cases and there was a history of it in two of the others.<lb/>
Spite of the lack of laboratory findings, which are being made, the diagnosis<lb/>
is clear. The consensus of opinion as to the nature of the disease is general<lb/>
among the physicians I have seen, not many I confess but men familiar with<lb/>
the diseases of this section. It has been, I understand however, diagnosed<lb/>
as &ldquo;Spanish Influenza&rdquo;. None of the cases I have seen, or heard of, had<lb/>
respiratory symptoms and eruptions near or at the end of the fever, are<lb/>
very common.</p>
<p>2) The first cases seem to have been noted about August 20. Since<lb/>
then they have increased rapidly. I have heard the number to date estimated<lb/>
as from 1000 to 2500. There are, however, no figures even approaching<lb/>
accuracy. No deaths have been reported. It is indeed milder in its symptoms<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00813019"/>
#2<lb/>
than the dengue of Porto Rico in /15.</p>
<p>3) The opinion among the physicians who have expressed themselves<lb/>
as to its origin is that this disease came in with the transport Hancock,<lb/>
among Marines from San <unclear>Domingo</unclear> and Haiti. The undisputed facts as to this<lb/>
vessel area as follows: she arrived at Galveston August 5 with about <unclear>2200</unclear><lb/>
Marines aboard, about 600 of them were from Guantanamo, the remainder from<lb/>
San Domingo and Haiti. Neither this vessel nor her convoy the S/S. Yorktown<lb/>
stopped for Quarantine Inspection. The men from Guantanamo were landed<lb/>
here that day and are here now: About 800 of the others slept the night of<lb/>
August 5, under the shed on the Mallory Dock. They went aboard <unclear>and with</unclear><lb/>
the rest of the men from San <unclear>Domingo</unclear> and Haiti, left in the ship the next<lb/>
day (I understand) for Hampton Roads.</p>
<p>I have seen the Naval Surgeon; Kammerer, who was Surgeon in Command<lb/>
for the Marines who landed here, he states that there was some Influenza aboard<lb/>
among his contingent but no Dengue. That some cases of influenza came ashore<lb/>
here but that this soon c<del>lo</del><add><unclear>be</unclear></add>sed and that there have been no cases of Dengue<lb/>
among the Marines at this camp. He says also, but not from his own knowledge,<lb/>
that there were a number of cases of influenza among the Marines from San<lb/>
<unclear>Domingo</unclear> and Haiti. He was occupied with the care of his own men.</p>
<p>The report of the inspection of the City Health Office was that<lb/>
there were &ldquo;104 sich aboard her mainly malarial&rdquo; and quoted Dr. Humphreys<lb/>
in charge of sick bay for this statement. This is a morbidity of nearly<lb/>
5%.</p>
<p>I will not go into the observations and deductions of the Galveston<lb/>
physicians, who ascribe this dengue to the Marines from San <unclear>Domingo</unclear> and<lb/>
Haiti, although ther are well worth consideration because an examination<lb/>
of the medical <unclear>histories</unclear> of the men sick aboard the Hancock and in the ports<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00813020"/>
#3<lb/>
of departure should settle beyond question the fact whether there was Dengue<lb/>
among these Marines or no.</p>
<p>That there were no cases of Dengue among the 600 men from Guan-<lb/>
tanamo either aboard ship or since they have landed here (as Surgeon Kammerer<lb/>
says) does not I think negative the statement of dengue among the other<lb/>
Marines. If, as Dr. Kammerer further asserts, there were no mosquitoes<lb/>
aboard the Hancock, dengue aboard her was not a communicable disease and<lb/>
as these men marched directly out to their barracks they had not been exposed<lb/>
to its infection. If however there were men, infective to mosquitoes the<lb/>
800 men who slept on the dock they might well have infected mosquitoes and<lb/>
them the town. I have seen both Aedes (stegomyia) calopus and C fatigave<lb/>
here: the latter is quite common.</p>
<p>I do not write the above paragraph, as an argument for the intro-<lb/>
duction of dengue from the Hancock, simply to show that the non-occurrence<lb/>
of dengue among the Guantanamo Marines would not negative its existence<lb/>
among their <unclear>shipmates</unclear>. Whether dengue existed aboard the Hancock should<lb/>
be absolutely determinable by the Naval records.</p>
<p>I would also suggest that the Bureau determine by correspondence,<lb/>
if Dengue exists in any town on the mainland of Texas or La. This may help<lb/>
to determine id it entered Galveston by Sea or not. I am informed by Dr.<lb/>
Wilson from Dr. Holt that he had heard of none at Houston at the time he<lb/>
wrote, Thursday or Friday last.</p>
