<p>....... As to the Wyeth Co. people I have not heard from them. I do have one or<lb/>
two photographs of my Father in uniform, but never saw any of his uniforms that I can<lb/>
remember. An old Khaki hat (campaign type, broad-brimmed felt) we used to use in the<lb/>
attic for &ldquo;dressing up&rdquo; games. I have also seen the revolver, belt, buttons, etc.<lb/>
lying around in the old house. I am sure though, and his pictures are all in such a<lb/>
one, that he usually wore white uniforms. I shall have some copies of the pictures<lb/>
I have, made this week, and shall keep them on hand, in case they finally want them.<lb/>
If you wish, and there is time before you start south I shall send you some.</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>My personal criticism of the sketches is the same of the film by Robert<lb/>
Montgomery. The tendency to make father short and latin in gestures and attitude is<lb/>
ever present. He happened to be the only one in the Commission who knew Dr. Finlay,<lb/>
therefore the introductions were naturally made by him and he would not look as<lb/>
&ldquo;puzzled&rdquo; at the old man's explanations as they make him appear in the sketches. He<lb/>
had heard the crazy and unscientific notions of Finlay time and again. Finlay was not<lb/>
tall, stout and inclined to be &ldquo;<unclear>paunchy</unclear>&rdquo; like his son, with blinking myopic little<lb/>
<unclear>Scotch</unclear> eyes. The erect and beautifully tailored old man would never fit in my<lb/>
imagination with the &ldquo;buggy-doctor&rdquo; oculist who went around fitting eyeglasses in<lb/>
Camaguez province. Who are the sitting figures (certainly not a Cuban the one with<lb/>
the Lincolnian attitude).</p>
<p>The U. S. commission is not too bad. Reed of course is made bigger to<lb/>
command attention and Lazear, a distinguished type with a very quiet manner would<lb/>
naturally be quietly hearing and observing the interview. Carol who was against the<lb/>
thing and a grouchy sort of fellow of humble origin and always ill at case among<lb/>
strangers would probably be sulking in a corner. And as to my Father, one of the<lb/>
pictures is not so bad, the other one makes him look like a dwarf and I specially<lb/>
object to the position of his hands. He happened to have the most beautiful hands I<lb/>
ever have seen in a man but though always well kept, they were strong and nervous,<lb/>
manly in every gesture and <hi>never</hi> in the french music-master posture he has in one of<lb/>
the sketches (arched little finger et al). It seems hard to convince Americans that<lb/>
a Cuban can be 6 ft. 1 inch, have dark hair, but very bright blue eyes and a ruddy<lb/>
complexion.</p>
<p>Another thing the patio-background is not bad in itself. <add>(1)</add> The flag of course<lb/>
is ridiculous; no Cuban would submit his flag to such disrespect as crowding it in<lb/>
a corner of an indoor patio, and he would never expose it except on National holidays<lb/>
and always on the front of his house, (2) I imagine Finlay used to wear a Prince Albert<lb/>
like all doctors then, but he would never have white vests and fancy light pants.<lb/>
(3) Again, guests would never be allowed to stand, and much less keep holding their<lb/>
caps (or is it a cap Reed and Carol are holding). (4) The kind of furniture in the<lb/>
picture (heavy carved pieces and books) would never be placed in a patio in this<lb/>
country (remember daily showers that seem to drop out of a clear sky). No Cuban would<lb/>
work outside under the glare of the sun and less in those days with the heavy clothes<lb/>
they were. (5) Last but not least, a Cuban might entertain some visitors in a gallery<lb/>
along the sides of a patio under roof always, in shady and cool comfort, but we, and<lb/>
the older generations much less, never considered the patio in the light of the Palm<lb/>
Beach or Hollywood crowd. That is left to hotels and restaurants. A patio provides<lb/>
shady trees, captures the breeze, gives space for the refreshing sound of a fountain,<lb/>
and serves as communication for all the family (from rooms, to street, to dining room,<lb/>
etc.) Some of the women may even bring out their sewing perhaps, but the family never<lb/>
<del><unclear>f</unclear></del>lounges" in it, Andalusian style. Remember that in the old Colonial houses of the<lb/>
type pictured, even the horses were led across the patio into the back yard and stables,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03842011"/>
- 2 -<lb/>
after unhitching the carriage which remained in the broad entrance hall or &ldquo;zaguan.&rdquo;<lb/>
Is it plausible that Finlay received formal visitors, and spread out all his working<lb/>
materials and instruments where there is such little seclusion. Father expressly<lb/>
mentions that Finlay handed them a glass jar with some of his precious mosquitoes<lb/>
<hi>in his study.</hi></p>
<p>I am very skeptical (please don't feel offended, because you certainly are<lb/>
conscientious in your research) about the general attitude of Americans when they set<lb/>
out on some scheme, where costuming or historical accuracy is required. Hollywood<lb/>
versions of historical events generally disappoint me for their gross incongruities.<lb/>
Your friends of Wyeth and Co. will probably prefer not to hear my opinion in the matter.<lb/>
The artist was in Cuba last year, but he never tried to get in touch with me while in<lb/>
Havana and I tried unsuccessfully to meet him.</p>
<p>Even the theatrical setup of the patio is not so bad if the sun were not so<lb/>
strong on both guests and host. Also polished wood furniture, which would not survive<lb/>
a week of our outdoors. It would seem to be about noon according to the bright<lb/>
splashes of sunlight. Never, in late afternoon, would a Cuban patio be so glary.<lb/>
The sketch with the shutter and glass door background is much better in all respects<lb/>
than the other one. The type of window-grating on that one would naturally be the<lb/>
kitchen and servants' quarters near which no guests would loiter, especially in those<lb/>
days. The one I prefer has the cap in Reed's hand (or is it) and Finlay's white waist-<lb/>
coat, bow-tie and fancy pants and Lazear (who would naturally be interested and atten-<lb/>
tive) is too much in the background, for the one member in the Commission who knew<lb/>
most about mosquitoes.</p>
<p>I am sure my impressions about this will interest you far more than Wyeth<lb/>
and Co. that is why I am bothering you with them. Hurriedly given out, at random while<lb/>
examining the pictures at first sight, they are probably not worth much, after all.</p>
<p>Will you tell me who the publisher of Finlay's biography is? I have tried to<lb/>
get it in our bookstores without any results and I wish to order a copy, as I am<lb/>
sure most of it must prove &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; to read. Charlie Finlay, Jr. is not at all<lb/>
a literary man, but I have heard he didn't write it, only sponsored and backed the<lb/>
contents. So much better for the story, because he stutters even in writing.</p>
<p>I apologize. I am very biting today; but please excuse me........</p>
