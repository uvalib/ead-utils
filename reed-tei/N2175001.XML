<p>Gen. Wood Explains.</p>
<p>It gratified us to read in the New York<lb/>
Sun of the 8th instant a letter to the<lb/>
editor from Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood,<lb/>
military governor of Cuba. We had<lb/>
known that there was a rumor current in-<lb/>
dicating something in the nature of a<lb/>
friction between Gen. Wood and Gen.<lb/>
Ludlow. Gossip, more or less irresponsi-<lb/>
ble, had it that the former had, by impli-<lb/>
cation, accused the latter of having sup-<lb/>
pressed the yellow fever reports in Ha-<lb/>
vana a year ago.</p>
<p>The prevalent idea last January was<lb/>
that there had been little or no yellow<lb/>
fever in Havana during 1899, and public<lb/>
opinion, with characteristic innocence,<lb/>
jumped to the conclusion that this im-<lb/>
agined immunity was the result--the log-<lb/>
ical and inevitable result--of the street<lb/>
sweeping and other sanitary measures<lb/>
employed by the Brooke regime, under<lb/>
the immediate direction and control of<lb/>
Gen. Ludlow. After Gen. Wood's acces-<lb/>
sion to the governorship announcements<lb/>
of yellow fever came to be of almost daily<lb/>
occurrence, and as the summer deepened<lb/>
and the disease extended its field, there<lb/>
ensued a popular conviction that Gen.<lb/>
Wood must have set aside the sanitary<lb/>
plans and dismissed the sanitary precau-<lb/>
tions which, under Gen. Ludlow's admin-<lb/>
istration, had (sic) eradicated the pest<lb/>
and destroyed the material upon which<lb/>
it depended for vitality.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to believe that, in<lb/>
these circumstances, Gen. Wood resented<lb/>
such ignorant and unwarranted assump-<lb/>
tions. Nor need we cherish any surprise<lb/>
on account of his attempt to exonerate<lb/>
himself from charges and suspicions so<lb/>
undeserved. He was, in fact, held re-<lb/>
sponsible for all the yellow fever in and<lb/>
about Havana during 1900, and, to make<lb/>
the matter worse, was twitted with the<lb/>
suggestion that if he had not neglected<lb/>
the example and advice of Gen. Ludlow<lb/>
the immunity existing when he took<lb/>
charge would have been perpetuated. One<lb/>
can readily forgive him, therefore, for<lb/>
having resented this absurd injustice and<lb/>
for having shown--as seems to be the<lb/>
fact--that there was no immunity; that<lb/>
yellow fever had not been eradicated, and<lb/>
that whatever merit resided in the sani-<lb/>
tary system inaugurated by Gen. Ludlow<lb/>
had been carefully cultivated under his regime.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to suppose, however,<lb/>
that Gen. Wood, in defending himself<lb/>
against misrepresentation, intended to<lb/>
cast, or, indeed, did cast, the smallest<lb/>
reflection upon Gens. Brooke and Ludlow.<lb/>
He did not assert, or even suggest, as has<lb/>
been alleged in certain quarters, that<lb/>
those officers withheld the facts concern-<lb/>
ing yellow fever while they were in<lb/>
charge of the situation. We give what<lb/>
he says on this point in his letter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not state, directly or indirectly, that the<lb/>
fever situation was concealed. I stated the fever<lb/>
situation last December, saying that in December,<lb/>
1899, there were more deaths in the civil popula-<lb/>
tion from yellow fever than in any December in<lb/>
ten years, and that the fever was with us through-<lb/>
out the winter. I stated also that at present the<lb/>
exact fever situation was given to the press for<lb/>
general publication daily, and that in the fall of<lb/>
1898 (1899) this method of publication was not<lb/>
adopted. Statements then, I believe, were made<lb/>
monthly, and comparatively little was heard of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purpose of my statement was to correct an<lb/>
impression which I found to be generally prevalent,<lb/>
namely, that the yellow fever situation in Havana<lb/>
must be due to lack of proper sanitary precautions,<lb/>
and that it was in remarkable contrast with the<lb/>
conditions of last year, and in correcting this I<lb/>
stated that the conditions of this year were due<lb/>
to the enormous number of Spanish immigrants<lb/>
pouring into Cuba through this port, all of them<lb/>
food for fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also stated that Havana was cleaner to-day<lb/>
than ever, inasmuch as the sanitary work inaugu-<lb/>
rated by Gen. Ludlow is being pushed forward<lb/>
with the same degree of intelligence and energy,<lb/>
and under the same personnel, as during his gov-<lb/>
ernorship of the city; that the sanitary condition<lb/>
of the city was better than before, as shown by<lb/>
the total death rate from all causes, even including<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing in my statements which<lb/>
could, directly or indirectly, be taken as a charge<lb/>
that there was any concealment of yellow fever<lb/>
last year. Such an inference is unfair to me and<lb/>
unjust to the officers in charge at Havana. The<lb/>
misstatements in this particular should be cor-<lb/>
rected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears, therefore, all these false im-<lb/>
pressions have arisen out of a misunder-<lb/>
standing. Last year the yellow fever re-<lb/>
ports were promulgated only at long in-<lb/>
tervals, thus attracting little attention.<lb/>
Under Gen. Wood's management of af-<lb/>
fairs they are given out daily, thus keep-<lb/>
ing the facts constantly in view. The<lb/>
difference is one of systems. Gen. Wood<lb/>
has not cast the smallest reflection upon<lb/>
Gen. Ludlow. On the contrary, he has<lb/>
paid him the sincere compliment of per-<lb/>
petuating with sleepless energy his sani-<lb/>
tary plans and methods. Gen. Wood sim-<lb/>
ply objects to unwarranted and injurious<lb/>
criticism, and in that he deserves and<lb/>
will receive the sympathy of all just men.</p>
<p>We gather from this utterance that<lb/>
 Gen. Wood does not accept street sweep-<lb/>
ing and carbolic acid as yellow fever de-<lb/>
stroyers. That, however, was to have<lb/>
been expected in his case.</p>
