<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I think that I should let you<lb/>
know how I am progressing for<lb/>
it was back in Jan that I wrote you<lb/>
last. I continue to make nice progress<lb/>
but as you know it is a slow affair,<lb/>
for all of those muscles have to be<lb/>
exercised and if you overdo them they<lb/>
rebel- get sore- and that retards everything.<lb/>
My right hand is getting to be quite<lb/>
useful and I walk quite well- Do over<lb/>
a mile a day by myself-</p>
<p>I do hope you will be able to get<lb/>
on the right side of young Carroll and<lb/>
get his notebooks, letters &amp; other papers-<lb/>
Perhaps they can be bought! The cover<lb/>
I sent you may not be like the note<lb/>
book we want to find. While I think it<lb/>
may have been a book of that kind I<lb/>
can not recollect anything about it,<lb/>
especially as to its exact size or the color<lb/>
of its cover. If I saw it and its contents<lb/>
I would probably be able to identify it.<lb/>
Keep after it, Very <del><unclear>,</unclear></del> important!</p>

<p>I failed to locate Lampon. By good luck<lb/>
I found Vena Richmond, the nurse who<lb/>
was in charge of the receiving ward, under<lb/>
me, at Camp Columbia in 1899. She interviewed<lb/>
Lampon when he was writing his book. You<lb/>
will find her name among those he thanked<lb/>
in his preface. She left us in Nov '99<lb/>
for the P. I. so she could not be of help<lb/>
to us about Reed's work. She has a fine<lb/>
record of service in Cuba, P. I., Panama &amp;<lb/>
in the US. She was also with Noguchi in South<lb/>
America. She liked my book-</p>
<p>I hope you have found a good<lb/>
place to live and can have your family<lb/>
with you, I also hope that you will<lb/>
find things favorable for that special work<lb/>
you had in mind.</p>
<p>Be sure to send me the photos of the<lb/>
y. f. huts. Miss Richmond mentioned them<lb/>
as their small pox huts while the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> <unclear>Div</unclear> was there,<lb/>
That confirms what we heard elsewhere.</p>
<p>Don't forget to keep me advised of<lb/>
of your doings especially on the y. f.<lb/>
work.</p>
