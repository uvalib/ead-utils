STATION HOSPITAL<lb/>
Camp Carson, Colorado<lb/>
<date value="1943-01-30">January 30, 1943</date>
</dateline>
Dr. Edgar Mayer<lb/>
New York City<lb/>
New York<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Mayer:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was delighted indeed to receive your telegram which<lb/>
gave me concrete evidence of your continued interest in my Cuban<lb/>
Yellow Fever studies. I am of course also delighted that you<lb/>
have been able to interest others in the little venture of mem-<lb/>
oralizing properly Camp Lazear. Dr. Fishbein knew a little a-<lb/>
bout it, but I never told him very much of my Cuban discoveries.<lb/>
To have the support of the new Finlay Institute will go a long<lb/>
way toward helping me realize my hopes.</p>
<p>Now as to the possibility of my coming to New York on<lb/>
February 13 - I am not so sure. There are two reasons why I<lb/>
believe I will not be able to come then. The first is a personal<lb/>
reason: my wife arrives February 3, and has planned to stay<lb/>
with me here about three weeks. Her<del>e</del> arrival here has been de-<lb/>
layed two weeks because of the serious illness of my mother in<lb/>
Rochester, who has just now been able to leave the hospital.<lb/>
I don't want to make my wife's visit here too short as we are<lb/>
going to have our fourth baby in March, and it may be some months<lb/>
before she can visit me in Colorado again. Not only is there this<lb/>
personal reason, but another, namely, that we are having a great<lb/>
increase of patients in the hospital. We are opening new wards<lb/>
every few days and expect to open four wards in the next two<lb/>
weeks. Three of our men leave today for detached service until<lb/>
about the middle of February, and five were ordered away three<lb/>
weeks ago to take special courses in Washington and elsewhere.<lb/>
So that we are short handed, so much so that I believe that I<lb/>
should not request leave for at least three or four weeks. Of<lb/>
course, if Washington orders me away toward the end of February,<lb/>
that is a different matter, but I don't believe that they would<lb/>
do that. Our baby will probably be born about the second or<lb/>
third week in March. Would that be a convenient time for me to<lb/>
come East, after I have gone home, welcomed the new arrival, and<lb/>
spent a few days? I should be interested indeed to hear what<lb/>
you and Dr. Fishbein feel about this. I have not yet heard from<lb/>
Dr. Fishbein, but I am taking the liberty of sending him a carbon<lb/>
of this letter.</p>

<p>I should be greatly honored indeed to be allowed to work<lb/>
more <del><unclear></unclear></del><add>closely</add> with your Board of Directors. I do believe<lb/>
that my own aspirations dovetail very closely those of your<lb/>
institute.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
