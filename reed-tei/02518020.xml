<p>Havard reports on the claims of Caldas and Bellingaghi that they discovered a preventative and curative serum for yellow fever.

</opener>
<p>I have the honor to report that the medical commission<lb/>
detailed by Circular Letter No. 59 Headquarters Department of<lb/>
Cuba, 1901, met at four o'clock p.m. August 5, 1901, at Las Animas<lb/>
Hospital, and proceeded to examine into the alleged discoveries,<lb/>
propositions and claims of Drs. Caldas and Bellinzaghi. These<lb/>
gentlemen, being both present, submitted papers and testimonials<lb/>
establishing their professional standing as physicians and<lb/>
bacteriologists. Dr. Caldas then stated that he had discovered<lb/>
the causative microbe of yellow fever and prepared therefrom<lb/>
preventive and curative serums. For special reasons, Dr. Caldas<lb/>
is not willing at this time to exhibit his microbe and dis-<lb/>
close his process of isolation and culture, but desires to<lb/>
demonstrate the efficacy of his preventive serum, and in that<lb/>
indirect way prove that his microbe is really the cause of<lb/>
yellow fever. These gentlemen then submitted the following<lb/>
proposition to the board: That they be allowed to inoculate<lb/>
a certain number of volunteer non-immunes with their preven-<lb/>
tive serum, and then that these non-immunes be infected with<lb/>
the yellow fever germ, either by mosquitoe bites or direct<lb/>
blood injections. They contend that all non-immunes thus<lb/>
inoculated, or vaccinated, cannot contract yellow fever and will<lb/>
remain completely immunized for at least several years.</p>
<p>After careful consideration of the subject the board care<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02518021"/>
2<lb/>
to the conclusion that, on account of the refusal of Dr Caldas<lb/>
to demonstrate his microbe, and thus put his claim upon an<lb/>
entirely scientific basis, it is unable to recommend an active<lb/>
participation and cooperation in the testing of Dr Caldas'<lb/>
preventive serum. The board however sees no objection to fur<lb/>
-nish him and his colleague the opportunity and every reason-<lb/>
able facility to carry on their experiments, to supervise them<lb/>
and then officially report upon them. For this purpose, the<lb/>
board respectfully recommends that a sum, not to exceed $400.,<lb/>
be authorized to be expended if, in its opinion, the interest<lb/>
of science and of this island appear to justify such expendi-<lb/>
ture.</p>
