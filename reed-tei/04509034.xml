<salute>Dear Philip:</salute>
</opener>
<p>According your letter<unclear><del>s</del></unclear> I inform you, all persons named <unclear>ir</unclear><lb/>
it have been invited by letter, although later will mail them the<lb/>
official program of said day.</p>
<p>The photos I asked for, are periodistical propaganda said day, so <unclear>th</unclear><lb/>
that if I get some, maybe I can publish on the <unclear>papaers</unclear> 3rd December.<lb/>
I think you will be surprised when you see the photo of the Caseta;<lb/>
but we have tried to do all possible to leave it as on 1900, <unclear>although</unclear><lb/>
we have used in some parts used woods and new in others; but we have<lb/>
put enough it have and the rest not used will be left as souvenirs.</p>
<p>I think I have quite enough for that, I hope when you arrive here<lb/>
I guess on the 2nd December I will show you the little house and all<lb/>
well. I am sending some photos of all the work into few days.</p>
<p>As I told you before, you can take 8 or 10 minutes, that is on<lb/>
said time, you will be able to explain, what you think opportune.</p>
<p>Talking about <unclear>your true</unclear> sentiment like American Physicians, <unclear>pre-<lb/>
sent</unclear> among your partners recognized esteeming what this act constitu-<lb/>
tes after 52 years.</p>
<p>The Park still is Lazear Camp, and the Building Number 1, keep on<lb/>
with the name (same name), well up to now has been the <unclear>P<add>a</add>tronate</unclear><lb/>
thinking; in one word the Park will be Lazear Camp and the Building<lb/>
Number 1 or Fomites Building.-</p>
<p>My invitation is <unclear>exactrly</unclear> for the night Dcember 3rd <unclear>al</unclear> 9.00 P.M. on<lb/>
the Science Academy, so that you ought to reserve your trip back 4th<lb/>
day December.- You remember that night also the Condecoration Finlay<lb/>
will be given this year.</p>

mal all who sit down on the Presidential, and <unclear>you</unclear> will be one of<lb/>
them, you need to attend with the formal dress.- Beside that night<lb/>
the condecorated will place their jewels during the act.</p>
<p>Philip all is going alright up to now; the invitations on a mail<lb/>
the next week, so that all could receive it on time (the persons<lb/>
we esteem already we have invited by air mail).-</p>
<p>I am waiting Hanberry reply, to see how we can bring him down here.<lb/>
My idea is well appreciated for him to be the one who unveil the<lb/>
busts and the named plates.</p>
<p>I dont forget the persons, from Cuba, you mencioned <unclear>to</unclear> invited<lb/>
them to the act, and as regard Miss Rojas and Miss Cabrera, I will<lb/>
give them personally just the same Agramonte's daughter.</p>
<p>I agree with the last paragraph relating to the future, well you<lb/>
know how much work; this matter has given me; but we are here to<lb/>
continue on all necessary.</p>
<p>I am mailing today air way the others Negatives of the camp left,<lb/>
so that anything needed when you come, you will tell me, what else<lb/>
I can be useful.-</p>
