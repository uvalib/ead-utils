<p>Hanson hopes that there will be no more yellow fever cases after the year 1921. He describes his field work in detail: the use of fish to combat mosquito breeding was very successful but the limited use of containers was difficult to enforce.  He praises several inspectors for their good work.</p>

<salute>My Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your letter of October 10th on<lb/>
the last mail that came in before I left Chiclayo last Sunday. I<lb/>
was very glad indeed to get your letter; it is quite a help in<lb/>
this lonesome situation to hear from some one who fully understand<unclear><del>s</del></unclear><lb/>
and appreciates the situation. This job has been tremendously big<lb/>
and has been associated with innumerable worries and difficulties.<lb/>
At present we are most anxiously hoping that we shall be able to<lb/>
say that there was no fever in Peru after the year 1921, but as yet<lb/>
we can not be too sure about this. The other day we got a report<lb/>
that a case had been declared in Callao by a Dr. Barton, whom Drs.<lb/>
Mendoza, Benavides and Canseco say is a very relieble man. The usual<lb/>
arguments seem to have arisen in Callao and Lima over this case. I<lb/>
telegraphed the Salubridad for information, but up to the time that<lb/>
I left Chiclayo I had not received any reply. This is characteris-<lb/>
tic of them you know. I thought Wrightson might have done a little<lb/>
better than that, he could at least have replied stating that the<lb/>
thing was indefinite. In as much as I expected to come south for an<lb/>
inspection, i.e., my regular monthly trip I decided to continue on to<lb/>
Lima to get personal information, and have brought Dr. Mendoza and<lb/>
Sr. Burga Cisneros and Insp. Olivari with me so as to be able to<lb/>
start anything which may seem necessary when I get there.</p>
<p>Dr. Tapia came aboard in Salaverry and brought us the news th<lb/>
that the case had died on the 5th day and the autopsy, (by a Dr. Alme-<lb/>
nara) had shown it to be a case of severe malaria. I hope it is so.<lb/>
Dr. Almenara is a very clever young physician who has done a great<lb/>
deal of laboratory work, but whether he has enought experience with<lb/>
yellow fever to dicide a thing of this kind I am not so certain.</p>

<p>2. H.R.C., November 9th, 1921.</p>
<p>This sort of introduces a possibility for the change of my plans<lb/>
for the campaign. I had hoped that we could feel safe by extending<lb/>
the campaign as far south as Huacho, and possibly taking in the vall<lb/>
valley of the Chillon, just north of Lima. There are a great many haci-<lb/>
endas there where there might be a lurking focus of infection, and<lb/>
I had practically made all arrangements to clean those places up by<lb/>
a vigorous fish campaign wherever this proved to be the most feasible<lb/>
method. In fact I am quite convinced that it is about the only method<lb/>
of choice for antistegomya work. Up to date we have used over 350 000<lb/>
fish, with most excellent results. The container which has fish has no<lb/>
larvae. The people are beginnig to recognize the fact also because<lb/>
many who I meet in these ports tell me that at this time of the year<lb/>
last year they were terribly annoyed with mosquitoes, and now they<lb/>
never see or feel any. Such is the condition of the coast from<lb/>
Huacho north, but we do not yet know what we have about Lima or<lb/>
Callao. Wrightson and Richardson were doing some work there while<lb/>
the campaign was going on, but as soon as we recommended suppressing<lb/>
the quarantine restrictions against Libertad and Lambayeque they<lb/>
stopped their antistegomya measures.</p>
<p>You undoubtedly remember the circumstance of the two Japs<lb/>
who went from Ferre&ntilde;afe to Lima and died there. Undoubtedly there<lb/>
were other cases of the same nature, I kept getting reports of ru-<lb/>
mored cases and kept after the Salubridad about the matter but they<lb/>
seemed to think they knew more about the thing than I did, and never<lb/>
made any efforts to investigate, and even discouraged Quiroz when I<lb/>
wrote him to see the Salubridad about making a special investigation<lb/>
to prove or disprove these rumors. I have several copies of letters<lb/>
and telegrams in my files referring to this matter but unfortunately<lb/>
these copies are of no value in rectifying the damage done. The prob-<lb/>
lem of Callao or Lima or both, is not such an insuperable one, were it<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00916027"/>
3. H.R.C., November 9th, 1921.<lb/>
not for the possibilities which it points out in regard to the <unclear>south.</unclear><lb/>
There are several places to the south of Lima where the temperature<lb/>
is sufficiently high to have stegomya breeding, and if we find any<lb/>
proofs of the genuineness of this case togather with the history of<lb/>
other cases it seems that we will be obliged to make an investigation<lb/>
of the territory to the south, however let us hope that this is all a<lb/>
premature discussion.</p>
<p>I imagine that we probably could have gotten this fish in the<lb/>
Chira river, probably not in the Piura because the latter goes dry.<lb/>
The fish which is far the best of those we have tried is the &ldquo;life&rdquo;<lb/>
I have tried to get a scientific classifacation of this fish but to<lb/>
date have not succeeded. If I cant get this done in Lima I will send<lb/>
some samples to Washington. I have a number of odds and ends of this<lb/>
kind to attend to in Lima this time and will try to find out where<lb/>
we can get this work done. The work of Corrigan and Sainz in the De-<lb/>
partment of Ancash was a very brilliant demonstration of the effi-<lb/>
casy of the fish. Unfortunately this fish is edible, and my men tell<lb/>
me that we lose a great many fish in this way. We have calculated our<lb/>
losses at about <unclear><del>2x</del></unclear> 26%, most of it due to contrariness on the part of<lb/>
the people. We are going to make a third trial with the small fish<lb/>
of the type from Barbadoes, &ldquo;milliones&rdquo; as they call them here and in<lb/>
Guayaquil. If we get them now at the beginning of the warm season we<lb/>
may be able to get them aclamitized before the cold weather comes on<lb/>
again. It seemed like the last batches we had died on account of the<lb/>
cold weather coming on.</p>
<p>Limiting containers is a more difficult thing to enforce, when<lb/>
one has as extensive a territory as that which we have this year. We<lb/>
have worked to date in <unclear><del></del></unclear> 75 towns and haciendas on the coast, and it<lb/>
would take <del><unclear>xxxx</unclear></del><add>a numerous personnel</add> to enforce the other methods (i.e. other than fish)<lb/>
Casa Grande was practically the only hacienda in Libertad which had<lb/>

the epidemic. In the Department of Lambayeque they all had it, and<lb/>
much more of <del><unclear>it than they cared to admit.</unclear></del> than they cared to admit.</p>
<p>The Medico at Guadelupe turned out O.K. and he has been placed<lb/>
in charge of the work in the Province of Pacasmayo. He is very much<lb/>
interested and enthusiastic about the work. Arce at Salaverry is one<lb/>
of the best men on the coast north of Lima. Dr. Tapia also has turned<lb/>
out to be exceptionally valuable to the campaign. In fact I have more<lb/>
confidence in him as a submanager than in almost any of the others.</p>
<p>I note what you say about emptying containers and the index,<lb/>
in which I quite agree with you. The difficulty in emptying contain-<lb/>
ers is that there is generally a scarcity of water, and it gives rice<lb/>
to difficulties, on the part of the people. No question about it being<lb/>
an effective method where it can be done.</p>
<p>In regard to the cement lined barrels we have since found<lb/>
them breeding, but in each case it has been where the barrel had be-<lb/>
come very dirty. Dunn scouts the idea that they do not breed as free-<lb/>
ly in these as in other containers. We will wait and see.</p>
<p>The stegomya does lay her eggs on the water under artificial<lb/>
conditions such as Dunn had in his laboratory experiments, but I do<lb/>
not think they do unless forced to do so for lack of a wall to place<lb/>
her eggs higher up.</p>
<p>Since writing the above Mr. Dunn has been aboard, as we are<lb/>
now in the port of Huacho, and about to sail for Callao. Dunn seems<lb/>
very much interested in the work and thoroughly impressed with the<lb/>
extensiveness of the campaign. There is still so much field work to<lb/>
be done that we find it a bit difficult to decide when to begin the<lb/>
actual research work. I am very much pleased that I conceived the<lb/>
idea of bringing Mr. Dunn down, he is a very good man for this kind<lb/>
of work, and has ability and judgement and intelligence<add>,</add> which is<lb/>
a great thing.</p>
<p>Well I must close for this time and write you again from Li<lb/>
Lima after I get a room and get things sized up a bit.</p>
<p>With all good wishes, and many thanks for your most inter-<lb/>
esting letter,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
