<title>Letter from Philip Showalter Hench to J.F. Siler, September 6, 1950</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Hench informs Siler that he has heard from Blossom Reed, who described her financial distress and seemed somewhat incoherent. Hench suggests that it would be a comfort to her if the Walter Reed Memorial Association could let her know that the annuity will continue. He also mentions the possibility of using some of the principal of the trust to help Blossom keep her home.</p>

Colonel J. F. Siler<lb/>
Gorgas Memorial Institute<lb/>
1835 Eye Street, N. W.<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Siler:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just had a letter from Blossom Reed. In confidence, may I<lb/>
tell you that she is somewhat concerned about her financial status. There<lb/>
is a mortgage on her house of $3500 and I think she borrowed $500 to paint<lb/>
the house. Just in passing she mentions that her &ldquo;nest egg is now about $84.&rdquo;<lb/>
In another sentence she states that one cannot live on $84 a year. Also she<lb/>
states that she has never had any word from the Chase National Bank of New<lb/>
York.</p>
<p>I am a little concerned about the letter. In spots it seems a bit<lb/>
incoherent or at least difficult to understand and I wonder whether she is<lb/>
having a mild recurrence of her previous trouble.</p>
<p>On a previous occasion I was able to help her out. I feel very<lb/>
indebted to her and her family and wish I could help more and perhaps I<lb/>
can, although at the moment I am involved because of various immediate re-<lb/>
quirements.</p>
<p>May I suggest that it would be a great comfort to her if she were<lb/>
to hear very soon that the annuity formerly given to her mother would be<lb/>
given to her. I do not have at hand at the moment the minutes of the last<lb/>
meeting of the Walter Reed Memorial Association, nor do I at the moment<lb/>
recollect the total amount of the trust fund, but if my recollection is<lb/>
correct the trust was arranged so that part of the principal could be used<lb/>
if necessary. Blossom is of course very anxious to keep her home and I<lb/>
suppose may consider taking in roomers as she did during the war. This<lb/>
would help out. Do you think it would be in order for the Treasurer of<lb/>
the Walter Reed Memorial Association or yourself to make discreet inquiries<lb/>
as to her present and future needs.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is anything I can do and as I said,<lb/>
please consider this letter in confidence. I should prefer that you would<lb/>
initiate whatever action may seem proper and necessary.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
