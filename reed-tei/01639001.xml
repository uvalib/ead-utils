<salute>My own precious E.;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I sincerely<lb/>
hope that the morning is as<lb/>
bright and beautiful at Murfrees-<lb/>
boro as it is at Willet's Point-<lb/>
I have never enjoyed a morning<lb/>
more than this one; (of course I<lb/>
except all of those spent in your<lb/>
society.) Just after breakfast, I<lb/>
arrayed myself in full-dress u-<lb/>
niform, and in company with<lb/>
General Abbott &amp; other officers<lb/>
visited the Soldiers quarters, &amp;<lb/>
all the buildings connected with<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01639002"/>
with the Post, all of which were<lb/>
subjected to a rigid inspection-<lb/>
This is what is called &ldquo;Short In-<lb/>
spection-&rdquo; On next Sunday, we<lb/>
have &ldquo;Long Inspection;&rdquo; that is, besides<lb/>
an inspection of all the buildings,<lb/>
(officers' quarters excluded) there<lb/>
is a full-dress parade lasting<lb/>
an hour or more. I am re-<lb/>
quired to take part in it, but<lb/>
my drilling amounts to very<lb/>
little. I assure you, I appre-<lb/>
ciate ex<add>em</add>ption from drill duty,<lb/>
during the week, to its fullest<lb/>
extent. I sit on my veranda &amp;,<lb/>
while listening to the sweet<lb/>
strains of music, watch the<lb/>
companies go through their<lb/>
various military evolutions<lb/>
with a good deal of interest.<lb/>
I never knew what privileges<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01639003"/>
the medical Profession secured<lb/>
before, but I am fully con-<lb/>
vinced, at present, that they are<lb/>
invaluable, &amp; the profession has<lb/>
accordingly risen in my es-<lb/>
timation. With your permission,<lb/>
I don't think I'll be a prea-<lb/>
cher!- This by the way, however --<lb/>
I have now spent my first<lb/>
week here and I candidly tell<lb/>
you that I am better satis-<lb/>
fied than I had anticipated-<lb/>
Of course, I do not expect such<lb/>
a comfortable Post when I<lb/>
next receive orders, but I<lb/>
am pretty sure that I will<lb/>
be contented wherever I am<lb/>
sent, and my happiness will<lb/>
be supreme. Especially if<lb/>
you consent to go with me-<lb/>
Ah! what would I not<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01639004"/>
give, if <hi>you</hi> were only here!<lb/>
How happy I should be! And<lb/>
what delightful trips we would<lb/>
take to New York City! But<lb/>
never mind, I can forego pres-<lb/>
ent happiness for the joy<lb/>
which is to be hereafter! Don't<lb/>
<del>you</del> let some young gentle-<lb/>
man come along &amp; &ldquo;cut me<lb/>
out,&rdquo; or I shall wish that<lb/>
I had ne'er been born- Per-<lb/>
haps the best way for me to<lb/>
avoid this, is to drop a line<lb/>
occassionally to <hi>somebody's<lb/>
Mama</hi>! Be careful or you may<lb/>
hear something surprising!<lb/>
No! No! I'll retract <del>you</del> all of<lb/>
that- Bless your darling heart!<lb/>
I am willing <hi>to trust you any-<lb/>
where</hi>, &amp; I ought to know bet-<lb/>
ter than to try to tease you.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01639005"/>
I must tell you of a dream that<lb/>
I had, last night. What do you<lb/>
suppose it was? Well, I dream-<lb/>
ed that I was <hi>married</hi>! As<lb/>
you live, it was so- &amp; oh!<lb/>
imagine <hi>my horror</hi> when I<lb/>
<add>knew that I</add> was marrying a lady who<lb/>
was not a North Carolin-<lb/>
ian! I was never more mis-<lb/>
erable, &amp; in vain ransacked<lb/>
my brain to find out the<lb/>
explanation- Oh! these crazy<lb/>
dreams! How I dread them!<lb/>
simply because they make<lb/>
me so unhappy <add>un</add>till I can<lb/>
manage to <add>a</add>wake- Really, if I<lb/>
had to have another such<lb/>
dream, I should not care to<lb/>
ever sleep again- They say,<lb/>
however, that dreams go by<lb/>
contraries, which means that<lb/>
I <hi>will</hi> marry a <hi>North Caro-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01639006"/>
linian</hi>! Well, <hi>be it so</hi>!<lb/>
In my last letter, I promised to<lb/>
tell you some good news in<lb/>
this one. It may seem a little<lb/>
vanity on my part to think<lb/>
that you will consider it<lb/>
as &ldquo;good&rdquo; news -- But to the<lb/>
news. I find that it is per-<lb/>
fectly allowable for the Com-<lb/>
mander of a military Post<lb/>
to grant a leave of absence<lb/>
for one week, without con-<lb/>
sulting, in any way, the De-<lb/>
partment at Washington-<lb/>
And as we have the most<lb/>
obliging commander in the<lb/>
Army, I will certainly be able<lb/>
to visit you in the fall-<lb/>
There is no trouble whatever<lb/>
about getting the leave- The<lb/>
only think likely to prevent<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01639007"/>
me from coming, is that I<lb/>
<hi>may</hi> be ordered away from<lb/>
here to a Post so far away<lb/>
that 7 days would be of no<lb/>
use to me -- This is not at all<lb/>
likely- Still I mention what<lb/>
may possibly occur- Be-<lb/>
lieve me, my precious E., I<lb/>
am looking forward with<lb/>
much pleasure to my next<lb/>
trip- What delightful con-<lb/>
versations we will have!<lb/>
I know I appeared very<lb/>
stupid (pronounced &ldquo;s<hi>too</hi>pid&rdquo;)<lb/>
when I was last in Mur-<lb/>
freesboro, but I trust I shall<lb/>
give you no cause to com-<lb/>
plain when I next come.<lb/>
Forgive me this time, and I'll<lb/>
try to be brighter next time.<lb/>
And then <hi>such</hi> drives! as<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01639008"/>
Murfreesboro <hi>alone</hi> can afford-<lb/>
There will be no trouble about<lb/>
buggies either! I will have all<lb/>
such minor matters arranged<lb/>
before hand -- and I'll not let<lb/>
my hat blow off again, if<lb/>
there is such a thing as keep-<lb/>
ing it on! Ah! that will be<lb/>
an occassion long to be re-<lb/>
membered, &amp; it will soon come-<lb/>
Have not received a letter from<lb/>
you as yet, but am expecting<lb/>
one soon- I am going to N.Y.<lb/>
City tomorrow &amp; will see what<lb/>
the delay of the &ldquo;Art Journal&rdquo;<lb/>
is due to &amp; have it rectified at<lb/>
once- If matters do not go right,<lb/>
I shall certainly call for Charles!<lb/>
The latter individual, by the way, is<lb/>
vividly remembered; due to the<lb/>
sweet messages which he was<lb/>
wont to bring me.</p>
<p>Adieu, my sweet E,-</p>
<closer>
<salute>As ever,<lb/>
your devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
