<salute>My dear General Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wrote the enclosed letter some time ago but have held it as I thought<lb/>
you were not then in the mood to hear of Mrs. Lazear's death. In the meantime<lb/>
I have your fine note of April 8.</p>
<p>I had intended to be in Washington sooner but so many delays have occurred<lb/>
that I will not be able to get there until about six weeks from now. I will be<lb/>
there the first week in June. I have been asked to speak before a group there<lb/>
and will be having to spend some time in the Surgeon General's Office in behalf<lb/>
of my chapter for the Surgeon General.</p>
<p>You may wish that you hadn't contacted me so soon because when I get fed<lb/>
up with my patients and Surgeon General's chapter, I take a few hours off for<lb/>
my yellow fever hobby. I spent one whole weekend about four weeks ago going over<lb/>
every letter you and I had ever written each other, checking this and that, and<lb/>
as a result have written out a questionnaire of about seventy-five questions.<lb/>
This sounds like a difficult job, but I don't really believe it will be too diffi-<lb/>
cult. I hope to have it written up in the next week or ten days and send it to<lb/>
you just for you to look over and mull over. If you wish to postpone the whole<lb/>
matter until my arrival, we can then have Mrs. Franck in for a session, or should<lb/>
you prefer, you might want to have her in several times, just for a short time,<lb/>
and dictate to her whatever you wish. Regardless of the expense, it will be of<lb/>
tremendous value to me and I am delighted to have you make whatever arrangements<lb/>
with Mrs. Franck as are necessary, and I insist that she come to your home by<lb/>
taxi and put that on my bill.</p>
<p>Some of the questions you may think you have answered before. To a cer-<lb/>
tain extent that is true, but because of slight uncertainties, I have rephrased<lb/>
some of them. Many of them may not be entirely clear until you and I can talk<lb/>
over them. I know that in helping me do this, you and Mrs. Kean will be most<lb/>
careful that you are not tired and that you can do as much or as little of it<lb/>
as you want from day to day or wait until I come. Now, I am sure Mrs. Kean, if<lb/>
not you also, will be sorry that you wrote, when you see what your nice letter<lb/>
has gotten you into!</p>
<p>I have just received such a fine autographed photograph from General<lb/>
Reed. I am delighted indeed to have it. I heard by an indirect way that Dr.<lb/>
Foster Kennedy, a noted New York physician, had recently come into possession<lb/>
of &ldquo;an important yellow fever item.&rdquo; I wrote him and what do you think it is--<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06405099"/>
General Jefferson Kean &nbsp;&nbsp; - 2 - &nbsp;&nbsp; April 16, 1946<lb/>
none other than the original contract between Reed and Nicanor Fernandez:<lb/>
He has written me about it and I expect to see him in New York. How do you<lb/>
suppose he got that? My recollection was that it was in the Surgeon General's<lb/>
Office. Maybe the man who tried to steal yours was more successful regarding<lb/>
this one.</p>

<salute>Always sincerely,</salute>
