Dear Mother:</p>
<p>I presume we are having very near a hurricane<lb/>
at <unclear>last</unclear> a heavy storm. Blowing about as it did<lb/>
in S. Island in /88: not like the <unclear>Gale</unclear> of last October<lb/>
at <unclear>Chandeleur</unclear>. It really isn't as strong as that in /88<lb/>
because one can stand up in this wind <unclear>&amp; in that one</unclear><lb/>
could not at <unclear>times</unclear>. Still it is a good wind.</p>
<p>We have 3 convalescents <add>&amp; two attendants</add> <unclear>on Bird</unclear> Key in tents, to whom we<lb/>
cannot get <unclear>to</unclear> day. The tents <unclear>were</unclear> still standing when we could last see them.<lb/>
I wish they were up here: <unclear>but</unclear> we can't help it. They are safe enough.<lb/>
as <unclear>are we,</unclear> I think Laura finds it a comfort to know that we<lb/>
are on a rock foundation &amp; have a 40 foot wall around<lb/>
us. We have everything as secure as we can make it &amp; one<lb/>
just waiting. What we will lose we will lose. And the<lb/>
<unclear>glop</unclear> keeps falling. If it wasn't that we have a <unclear>shower tied</unclear><lb/>
to the wharf. I would not greatly mind: but the wharf, <del><unclear></unclear></del><lb/>
what is in it cost about $40,000.00/100, I am uneasy about it.<lb/>
It is more wind than we had while you were with us<lb/>
at <unclear>Chandeleur</unclear>: Indeed it is I suppose a hurricane.</p>
<p>We have been well, <unclear>same</unclear> Laura: She has<lb/>
not been so well, although not laid up nor have I felt<lb/>
well, still I am not sick. The children are very well &amp;<lb/>
I believe Henry is getting quite strong again.<lb/>
We keep <unclear>our quota</unclear> of <unclear>repels,</unclear> although the work is <unclear>pre-<lb/>
ciptibly</unclear> letting up <unclear>now, we came</unclear> in yesterday, just in<lb/>
time. We are not <hi>apt</hi> to get any man Y. F. &amp; I do hope<lb/>
we will <unclear>not</unclear>. Still it is not too late</p>
<p>What I will do this winter I do not know. I am<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00722006"/>
waiting to hear from <unclear>Mr Thornton</unclear> to whom I wrote about<lb/>
Dr <unclear>Dabney's</unclear> place. I would not be surprised if I stayed <unclear>here</unclear><lb/>
until March &amp; really would not greatly mind it. The<lb/>
children would escape the various colds &amp; <unclear>sore throats</unclear><lb/>
which make winter so <unclear>detectable</unclear>: It isn't a good life I<lb/>
had <unclear>human: &amp;</unclear> I wish for my own sake I was farming in the country<unclear>.</unclear><lb/>
However I must stay in the vacation I am</p>
<p>If I can get <unclear>north</unclear> this year. &amp; <unclear>come</unclear> any where near<lb/>
you I will <unclear>came to North River</unclear> for 10 or 15 days<unclear>,</unclear> My<lb/>
two flying <unclear>visits</unclear> were too brief to be counted<unclear>.</unclear> <unclear><del>in the</del></unclear><lb/>
This is a <unclear>storm</unclear> beyond all doubt &amp; I judge from<lb/>
the wreck of the coco&auml; nut trees that it is the hea-<lb/>
viest from this direction for some years.</p>
<p>Give my love to all at <unclear>home</unclear> &amp; at Hill's.</p>
<p>Your affectionate son<lb/>
H. R. Carter</p>
<p>25: night: It was a hurricane- The spray has <unclear>run</unclear> over the <unclear>fort</unclear> &amp;<lb/>
but that we lost all of our <unclear>gutters</unclear> early in the <unclear>action.</unclear> had<lb/>
<unclear>ruined</unclear> all the drinking water in <unclear>the fort</unclear>. One could not see 100 <unclear>y'ds</unclear><lb/>
for the spray <unclear>&amp; rain</unclear>. The <unclear>fort</unclear> of course protected us <unclear>&amp; we were</unclear> never in<lb/>
any danger, but even in the <unclear>fort</unclear> the grass is in places whipped to<lb/>
The sea <unclear>broke over</unclear> the <unclear>break water stored</unclear>, the <unclear>fort like battering rams,</unclear><lb/>
<unclear>pierced. outside</unclear> the little <unclear>cedars are</unclear> all <unclear><hi>pealed</hi>. &amp; bare of bark</unclear>.<lb/>
It was grand <unclear>will</unclear> &amp; had I not been worried about the <unclear>find</unclear> Key<lb/>
proper, to whom I could not get, I had <unclear>enjoyed</unclear> it. I manned a <unclear>ship's</unclear><lb/>
boat, <del>with</del> <unclear>4 oars</unclear> &amp; two men <unclear>to an oar</unclear> &amp; brought them off this<lb/>
afternoon<unclear>,</unclear> The <unclear>memoirs</unclear> good condition. Had been under the <unclear>yard</unclear><lb/>
up in the <unclear>bushes</unclear> &amp; had plenty of blankets<unclear>.</unclear> We <unclear>lost</unclear> nothing.<lb/>
$5.00 will pay for the damage the <unclear>floating raft</unclear> sustained. The<lb/>
buildings however, suffered a good deal &amp; what it will cost to re-<lb/>
pair them I scarcely know not over $1000.00 however<unclear>,</unclear>The <unclear>treas</unclear><lb/>
take <unclear>them.</unclear> I say a hurricane. It was <unclear>no</unclear> hurricane like <unclear>some</unclear><lb/>
that <unclear>we have</unclear> had. like that of Oct 2,/93 for instance <unclear>to that</unclear> at St. Thomas,<lb/>
still it was a <unclear>pretty stiff blar</unclear></p>
