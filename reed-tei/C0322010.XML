<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In reply to your letter of May 5th. asking further details<lb/>
relative to my tentative arrangement with Miss Brown:</p>
<p>As I wrote you on April 28th. Miss Brown told me, when we<lb/>
had our first talk on the subject of her helping me with the biblio-<lb/>
graphy of the History of Yellow Fever, that would <add>she</add> ask me approximately<lb/>
the same rate <add>of compensation</add> per hour that she was receiving for her <del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> work<lb/>
at the Library of Congress. Her salary is $200.00 per month.</p>
<p>Miss Brown's actual working hours at the Library are 6 1&sol;2<lb/>
hours per day--i. e. from 9 A. M. to 4.30 P. M. with an hour off for<lb/>
lunch, during which hour she works with me. (Says she never takes<lb/>
any lunch.)</p>
<p>6 1&sol;2 &times; 6 = 39 hours per week. Roughly counting 4 weeks to a<lb/>
month (I shall make the same, 4<lb/>
week, approximate count for her work<lb/>
with me)</p>
<p>39 &times; 4 = 156 hours per month (week days). To this I am ad-<lb/>
16 -------<unclear>(Sunday)</unclear><lb/>
<unclear>ding</unclear> 8 hours twice <del>a</del> a month (Sunday<lb/>
for afternoons when she is &ldquo;on<lb/>
call&rdquo; in the Index Dept. This is<lb/>
B: <unclear>--</unclear> not steady work like that during<lb/>
the week, however. Nor like the<lb/>
steady work she does for me on<lb/>
the other alternate Sundays.</p>
<p>--------<lb/>
<unclear>Maximum hours</unclear> per)--- 172<lb/>
month, L. of C.<lb/>
(approximately) See B.</p>
<pb n="2" id="fC0322011"/>
<p>-2-<lb/>
Sundays.</p>
<p>Miss Brown has been giving me, as a minimum of her time,</p>
<p>(a) 2 1&sol;2 hours per day, (Mon. Wed. Fri.) 1-2, P. M. 4.30-6 P. M.<lb/>
(b) 5 1&sol;2 " " " (Tues. Thurs. Sat.), returning to work from<lb/>
7-10 P. M. plus the<lb/>
hours given in (a)</p>
<p>(a) 2 1&sol;2 &times; 3<unclear>-</unclear>=7 1&sol;2 hrs. per week.<lb/>
5 1&sol;2 &times; 3= 16 1&sol;2 " " "<lb/>
------<lb/>
24 hrs. per week (week days).</p>
<p>Again counting a month<lb/>
as 4 weeks</p>
<p>24 &times; 4= 96 hrs. per month; (week days)<lb/>
10 " (2 Sundays)</p>
<p>B':- On alternate Sundays Miss<lb/>
Brown can put in 5 or 6 hrs.<lb/>
work on the bibliography.<lb/>
As in (B) I am just counting<lb/>
2 Sundays to the month:</p>
<p>------<lb/>
Approximate work hrs.-----106<lb/>
<unclear>-----</unclear><lb/>
per month, Bibliography.</p>
<p>1: Miss Brown <add>however,</add> is only asking me $65.00# to $75.00 a month for the<lb/>
106 hours work. This, according to whichever <add>amount</add> seems fair to me <add>(really to you)</add> She has<lb/>
also offered to give me more time, if I need it, without any increase in<lb/>
compensation, after the end of May, when she finishes up some other special<lb/>
work. Naturally, this is far below the rate she first mentioned to me, <add>even<lb/>
if one included the lunch hours, which I have deducted.</add><lb/>
This, because she has become very much interested in the work and is, I think,<lb/>
really enjoying our joint efforts therein. Miss Brown's services are well<lb/>
worth $75.00 a month, but I am sure that she will be satisfied at anything<lb/>
decided on within the radius mentioned. <del><unclear>Naturally, as per your previous in-<lb/>
structions, Miss. Brown considers the arrangement made with me, personally</unclear></del></p>
<p>2: <add>(a)</add> As to how Miss Brown should be paid: she has left that matter en-<lb/>
tirely to me, but I should think, if the salary asked meets with your appro-<lb/>
bation, that it would be better to put it on a monthly basis, as Miss Brown<lb/>
is giving me at least 24 hours a week of intensive work, and, if she were<lb/>
paid weekly, it would seem proper to keep closer to the approximate pay per<lb/>
hour than she is asking by the month--i. e. <add><unclear>to pay her</unclear></add> somewhat over, $94.00 a month <unclear>versus</unclear><lb/>
the $65.00 or $75.00 already mentioned.</p>
<p>(b): As to actual payment of Miss Brown's salary: I can either pay<lb/>
her myself and send you, <del>or the <unclear>Comp</unclear></del> the cancelled check <add>as a voucher</add> for reimbursement<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fC0322012"/>
-2-<lb/>
reimbursement,<lb/>
or you can advise the Comptroller to send me the additional money for Miss<lb/>
Brown's salary when he sends my check, in which case I can also send you<lb/>
my cancelled check to Miss Brown, since you wish her salary to be paid her<lb/>
through me and not directly from the Foundation. Of course, if our work<lb/>
together terminated before the end of a month, I should only pay her for<lb/>
the amount of work done. Equally, if she were ill, or had to stop for some<lb/>
other reason.</p>
<p>Frankly, if you approve the continuation of Miss Brown's services,<lb/>
I shall consider that we will be indeed fortunate to secure so unusually<lb/>
well equipped a person at so moderate a compensation. This especially after<lb/>
what I had been told on the subject by Dr. Putnam and others at the Library,<lb/>
as well as what I had heard from outside sources.</p>
<p>With very best wishes, and assuring you that Miss Brown and I<lb/>
are both working as hard as ever we can.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>

P. S. I might have made this letter shorter, and equally clear, if<lb/>
I had taken more time to it, but such time would have had to be taken from<lb/>
the bibliography--hence I'm sure you will pardon its length. For the same<lb/>
reason (to save time) I've given approximate statistics for the <add>hours of</add> work Miss<lb/>
Brown <del>does for</del> <add>gives</add> us vs. the Library of Congress: <del>counting theirs</del> the balance<lb/>
(at the salary she asks us, &amp; the hours she gives us) is really more in our<lb/>
favor than I have made it, as she <del>frequently</del> has <add>several times</add> given us an extra 3 hrs. on<lb/>
the nights when she is not supposed to work for us<add>, according to our<lb/>
present agreement.</add><lb/>
