<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You must have wondered what happened to me that I did not follow up my<lb/>
conversation on the phone. Quite frankly, I forgot all about the matter.</p>
<p>Your letter, with the enclosure of the book-list, brings everything<lb/>
back to my mind and makes me feel rather guilty that I did not write you.</p>
<p>I hardly know what to say. On thinking the situation over and looking<lb/>
over this list, I think I shall want to withdraw the offer I had tentatively made<lb/>
to you of $10 a book for each of the signed books. As far as I am concerned,<lb/>
books are just one darn nuisance. They are bulky and a nuisance to wrap and ship.<lb/>
I feel sorry for my colleagues who handle them.</p>
<p>Secondly, the market has changed so in recent months -- and I have no<lb/>
collectors of Walter Reed, only <unclear>inquiries</unclear> for cheap items of his -- that I do not<lb/>
think I want to saddle myself with such a collection. If I paid $10 per book, the<lb/>
very minimum I could quote them at would be $20, and I do not think I would find<lb/>
a market.</p>
<p>I consulted two very reliable book-dealers about your collection and<lb/>
showed them the list. Both of the dealers shook their heads. As far as they were<lb/>
concerned, the books had no value and the signatures had little interest for them.<lb/>
They would not make an offer of any kind.</p>
<p>If you really want to feel the market, I suppose the best policy would<lb/>
be to put one of the books up for sale and see what happens. You might be very<lb/>
pleasantly surprised. One never knows.</p>
<p>Forgive me for being so un-encouraging, but I do not know what else to<lb/>
say. I personally have been simply overwhelmed with collections of late, and I<lb/>
have gotten to the stage where I am spending my money only on items that I feel<lb/>
fairly sure I can dispose of. I do not feel sure of the Walter Reed and would<lb/>
prefer not to handle the books. I suppose the only solution would be for you to<lb/>

<p>Once again, thank you for thinking of me and do not forget me if you<lb/>
