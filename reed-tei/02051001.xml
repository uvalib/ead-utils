<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Saturday's<lb/>
mail brought me two sweet<lb/>
letters from my sweet oomsey<lb/>
&amp; one from darling little cake-<lb/>
maker- One of yours was post-<lb/>
marked &ldquo;Blue Ridge June 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp;<lb/>
reached here on the 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>-<lb/>
Pretty quick time that! I cer-<lb/>
tainly would like to have<lb/>
peeped in on that scene in<lb/>
the back-yard described<lb/>
by you in your letter. I<lb/>
know that the grapes can't<lb/>
already be so big as the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02051002"/>
circle you drew! Next year<lb/>
they ought to be beautiful.<lb/>
How many quarts of straw-<lb/>
berries did you get from<lb/>
your patch? They ought to<lb/>
have borne until about<lb/>
the end of June- Next year<lb/>
we will have a larger patch<lb/>
&amp; if you think of going up<lb/>
in May, we could get some<lb/>
that bear in May as well.<lb/>
Then you could have them<lb/>
for 8 weeks- Let Jacob now<lb/>
remove the straw &amp; work over<lb/>
the bed well- Don't dig too<lb/>
close to the old plants- About<lb/>
2 or three runners might be<lb/>
rooted from each plant- I<lb/>
will be back in time to see<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02051003"/>
about transplanting them- Am<lb/>
glad that the earth has been at<lb/>
last put on the lawn- The<lb/>
dear boy was out to see me<lb/>
yesterday &amp; took lunch &amp; dinner<lb/>
with me- He isn't as fleshy<lb/>
as he was, but looks quite<lb/>
well- His <hi>20</hi> days of exam-<lb/>
-ination took the flesh off of him.<lb/>
His class was asked 166 ques-<lb/>
tions in Mathematics alone! The<lb/>
examination was indeed pretty<lb/>
stiff &amp; I think that he deserves<lb/>
great praise to have stuck to<lb/>
it so faithfully- He says that<lb/>
he has had a letter from Mary<lb/>
Hume in which she called him<lb/>
my dear <hi>Lieutenant</hi>- I think that<lb/>
he would now enjoy going back<lb/>
to Georgetown once more- I hope<lb/>
that he may be able to get into<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02051004"/>
the artillery- Drove down to Ha-<lb/>
vana, saturday afternoon, &amp; enjoyed<lb/>
the trip very much- Gen. Wood<lb/>
will assign a special convey-<lb/>
ance and driver to our <unclear>Born</unclear>,<lb/>
which will make it very<lb/>
convenient for<del>m</del> us- As far as<lb/>
weather is concerned, a sum-<lb/>
mer in Cuba, at this particular<lb/>
point, is very desirable- It re-<lb/>
minds me continually of a Sum-<lb/>
mer resort, especially as the ocean<lb/>
is in plain view- Yesterday our din-<lb/>
ner was a good one, with cake<lb/>
and watermelon &amp; Lawrence seemed<lb/>
to enjoy it very much- Mrs. Stark will<lb/>
be caterer during July &amp; promises<lb/>
to give us a good bill of fare.<lb/>
How are the rhodedendrons? Blooming?<lb/>
Am glad to hear, though not surprised,<lb/>
that Jacob has been such a smart<lb/>
boy- Always give my regards to him &amp; to<lb/>
Mr Moore- Did the pay master send you<lb/>
duplicate notice of your deposit at end of June 2?<lb/>
Love &amp; kisses for my precious babies.</p>
<p>Devotedly,</p>
<p>Papa</p>

<p>Would you believe,<lb/>
lovie, dear, that your<lb/>
old Mr Mantee overslept<lb/>
himself, this morning, and that<lb/>
it is now 6,30 o'clock a,m,?<lb/>
I have just had my delicious<lb/>
shower bath and must hurry<lb/>
&amp; finish my letter before<lb/>
7 o'clock, as the Postman<lb/>
comes promptly at that<lb/>
hour- I can scarcely be-<lb/>
lieve that it was <hi>two</hi>(2)<lb/>
weeks ago, this afternoon,<lb/>
that I said good-bye to<lb/>
Fat Farmer lady &amp; plump<lb/>
piano-player at dear Kee-<lb/>
waydin- The time here sim-<lb/>
ply flies- I never saw<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02051006"/>
anything like it- While I<lb/>
think of it, and to return<lb/>
to farming, I think that if<lb/>
it becomes dry, you will<lb/>
have to let Jacob pull<lb/>
some of the leaves &amp; manure<lb/>
back around the little fruit-<lb/>
trees, as it serves as a<lb/>
mulch &amp; to protect their<lb/>
roots in hot weather.<lb/>
It was all right to have<lb/>
them nicely worked around<lb/>
and you were a dear, smart<lb/>
farmer lady to have thought<lb/>
about it. Now, lovie, dear,<lb/>
you know that the supposed<lb/>
Holy-hock that I planted<lb/>
was <hi>not a Squash</hi>? What<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02051007"/>
kind of a squash? Not a<lb/>
regular, old fashioned <hi><unclear>cim-<lb/>
lin</unclear></hi>? I don't believe it!<lb/>
The word &ldquo;rustler&rdquo; is<lb/>
proper &amp; in correct form,<lb/>
but it does not sufficient-<lb/>
ly describe Johnnie Moore's<lb/>
movements- You should have<lb/>
said that he was a <hi>Hust-<lb/>
ler</hi> from Hustlerville!<lb/>
How does the fence look, now<lb/>
that he has built a con-<lb/>
siderable part of it?<lb/>
Be certain to point out<lb/>
to him that beautiful plant,<lb/>
and don't let him destroy<lb/>
it- Am glad that auntie<lb/>
will soon be on the Mountain.<lb/>
you never told me what<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02051008"/>
decision Mr Moore came<lb/>
to<del>o</del> as to the <hi>pony</hi>- Did he<lb/>
take it? or did you return<lb/>
it to Cap't. Norwood? Has<lb/>
Blossom returned Mary's<lb/>
call yet? She certainly should<lb/>
do it- I know that your<lb/>
morning at dear Keewaydin<lb/>
cannot be any more beau-<lb/>
tiful than it is here, this<lb/>
morning, and the beautiful,<lb/>
blue ocean is so lovely<lb/>
to look at- You <hi>must</hi> come<lb/>
down &amp; take a peep next<lb/>
January- It's nearly seven,<lb/>
Love &amp; Kisses for my sweet<lb/>
Farmer lady and dear little<lb/>
chicken-raiser- Regards to<lb/>
Jacob, Cora &amp; Carrie- write-often.<lb/>
