Confidential<lb/>
FROM GEN. J. R. KEAN<lb/>

<salute>My dear Major Kean,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wanted very<lb/>
much to see you this week, but as<lb/>
Dr. Alden has gone away I do<lb/>
not care to go and leave only<lb/>
one surgeon here to do the work.<lb/>
I wanted to speak to you about<lb/>
Dr. Alden, among other things I think<lb/>
the United States could very well dis-<lb/>
pense with his services for the fol-<lb/>
lowing reasons, he lacks moral<lb/>
strength and professionally is for that<lb/>
reason incompetent to handle severe<lb/>
cases - such as that of <unclear>Pot. Chase</unclear> who<lb/>
died here. Again he is not sincere<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01942002"/>
and while outwardly professing the<lb/>
utmost friendship, etc., professes the<lb/>
opposite when he thinks it can be<lb/>
done without being detected. He is a<lb/>
man with a fine address and I was de-<lb/>
cieved at first as many thus are, but<lb/>
he is not trustworthy in any way. I<lb/>
would not care to have him as my<lb/>
assistant here with no one else to<lb/>
rely on. In addition to his gossiping<lb/>
with other people he gossips with the<lb/>
men going to them with his complaints<lb/>
instead of coming to me. I am quite<lb/>
satisfied that he made some com-<lb/>
plaint to Major Edmunds while he<lb/>
was here and I want to see the Major<lb/>
too and have my little say although<lb/>
that would not be a necessity I am<lb/>
sure. I have endeavored to treat<lb/>
all of my assistants with equal<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01942003"/>
FROM GEN. J. R. KEAN<lb/>
<hi>Confidential</hi><lb/>
consideration and to equally divide the<lb/>
labor. Several of the things I have told<lb/>
you I have found out since Dr. Alden<lb/>
left here. I could tell many others<lb/>
if I chose to gossip. Mrs. A. is a<lb/>
trouble-maker and her absence would be<lb/>
a distinct blessing and relieve much trouble<lb/>
in the female ranks from which I re-<lb/>
main distinctly neutral and Mrs. G likewise.</p>
<p>Dr. Jackson is a good surgeon and physi-<lb/>
cian I believe. However, the day he left<lb/>
here he made the remark in the presence<lb/>
of some of the men <add>(but not to me)</add> that if he could<lb/>
get the ears of the people at headquar-<lb/>
ters he would have the inspector down<lb/>
here. I do not believe that Maj. Edmunds<lb/>
visit, however, was due to any such repre-<lb/>
sentations. I find that with one loyal<lb/>
assistant here now that I can get along<lb/>
much better than with four; two of whom are<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01942004"/>
not. I believe Dr. Jackson is a good man<lb/>
for an A. A. Surgeon and that he is good<lb/>
professionally but after his threat in the pres-<lb/>
cence of witnesses I naturally do not think<lb/>
his prescence here could be of much value to<lb/>
me. Therefore I hope you will order him<lb/>
somewhere else, if convenient. If not I will<lb/>
do the best I can.</p>
<p>I made a discovery in the surgery line<lb/>
the other day. By raising the arm backwards<lb/>
and inwards from the shoulder joint so<lb/>
that the elbow will be back of the head the<lb/>
circulation of the axillary artery is entirely shut<lb/>
off. The position varies with the individual<lb/>
but works in every case. One fourth of an inch<lb/>
difference will close or open the circulation.<lb/>
I will report later with photographs. Dr. Press-<lb/>
oull and I operate nearly every day as I have<lb/>
charge of the surgery ward.</p>
