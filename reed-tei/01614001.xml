</opener>
<p>In your last<lb/>
letter you were speaking of the delight-<lb/>
ful spring-like weather that prevailed<lb/>
at Murfreesboro, and it made me<lb/>
sigh once more for that dear old<lb/>
town. Just to think that while it is<lb/>
almost impossible for us to keep<lb/>
warm, although we have four blaz-<lb/>
ing fires in the house, <del>that</del> you<lb/>
are able to spend your evenings<lb/>
in pleasant promenades &amp; star-<lb/>
gazings- That while we shrink in-<lb/>
doors from a wind blowing at<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01614002"/>
the rate of sixty miles an hour and<lb/>
a temperature 13&deg; below zero, you sit<lb/>
at your open window, aiding the gen-<lb/>
tle breeze with a palm leaf fan.<lb/>
Oh! my! how I should like to exchange<lb/>
lots with you! Ah! what have I<lb/>
said! Pardon me, my darling, I didn't<lb/>
intend to say that I should like<lb/>
for you to be exposed to these bit-<lb/>
ing winds, oh! no! only that I would<lb/>
like to hold a palm leaf in my<lb/>
hand and fan your sweet brow-<lb/>
Now wouldn't that be <hi>too</hi> charming!<lb/>
At the same time to discourse on<lb/>
pleasant topics, interspersed with<lb/>
words of affection -- from my lips, of<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01614003"/>
course. On second thought, I wouldn't<lb/>
have to say <hi>anything</hi>, since you have<lb/>
so <hi>many</hi> things to tell <hi>me</hi>. <hi>Can</hi> a<lb/>
body imagine any situation more<lb/>
delightful than to sit by his darling<lb/>
little sweetheart &amp; listen to pleas-<lb/>
ant words as they fall from her<lb/>
sweet lips? If there is any condition<lb/>
that conveys more happiness, I, for<lb/>
one, <hi>don't want to hear of it</hi>. I'm a-<lb/>
fraid it would be too great a tax on<lb/>
my heart- I know I should never<lb/>
live to tell of it- What! <hi>more</hi> pleas-<lb/>
ant than to listen to the tones (oh!<lb/>
the<del>se</del> <hi>tone</hi> of that voice, can I ever, for<lb/>
a moment, forget it?) of my own<lb/>
little Em's voice? Away with you!<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01614004"/>
and know that not all the choirs<lb/>
of this world could draw me from<lb/>
the sound of her voice!!</p>
<p>You perceive, my darling, that the<lb/>
above remarks were addressed to an<lb/>
imaginary person who <hi>dared</hi> tell<lb/>
me that I could find more pleas-<lb/>
ure elsewhere, than by your side;<lb/>
and you see how quickly I order-<lb/>
ed <add>him</add> from my presence. Indeed 'twere<lb/>
fortunate for him that he was<lb/>
purely imaginary, for had he been<lb/>
present in the body, I am inclined<lb/>
to think that I should have laid<lb/>
violent hands on him! All things con-<lb/>
sidered, it's well that I didn't meet him!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01614005"/>
I received a letter from Ma, yesterday,<lb/>
and from the general tenor of her<lb/>
remarks, I imagine that she is<lb/>
not over-pleased with Norfolk<lb/>
City life. It is so different from the<lb/>
quiet ways of her valley home that<lb/>
she finds some difficulty in ac-<lb/>
commodating herself to the ways &amp;<lb/>
customs of that little city. I think,<lb/>
however, that this will soon wear<lb/>
away, and I do not doubt but that<lb/>
she <add>will</add> at last, regret when the time<lb/>
arrives for her to return to the<lb/>
mountains- She spoke of a trip to<lb/>
Murfreesboro, but did not say when<lb/>
she would go- Since you say that<lb/>
if we are both in Murfreesboro, at<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01614006"/>
the same time, you will not so much<lb/>
as even <hi>look</hi><del>s</del> at <hi>me</hi>, and since the<lb/>
object of my trip to Murfreesboro<lb/>
is that <hi>you</hi>, &amp; no other, shall look<lb/>
at me (am growing a mustache for<lb/>
that very purpose), I will write to<lb/>
my mother, at once, &amp; beg her, either<lb/>
to make haste her visit, or delay it<lb/>
till after I have been <hi>looked at</hi>-<lb/>
I didn't think, my darling, that you had<lb/>
rather see my mother than myself-<lb/>
Well, never mind, when I come to Mur-<lb/>
freesboro, I am going to talk to a<lb/>
certain<del>ly</del> elderly lady &amp; not to you-<lb/>
What do you think of <hi>that</hi>? Ain't you<lb/>
sorry that you said so?<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01614007"/>
You will remember that I wrote you<lb/>
that there was some danger of Con-<lb/>
gress reducing the number of the<lb/>
Medical Corps, &amp; that I <del>would</del> might<lb/>
thereby lose my position -- Well that<lb/>
danger has passed -- The number of<lb/>
Assistant Surgeons will be reduced<lb/>
from 150 to 125, but as I am no. 112<lb/>
that won't affect me- Indeed, I have<lb/>
just seen, by yesterday's paper, that<lb/>
all of my class have been <hi>commis-<lb/>
sioned</hi> by the Senate. So you perceive<lb/>
that there is no<del>t</del> escape for you but<lb/>
to join the Army.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Adieu, my own<lb/>
sweet love. Ever, your fond and<lb/>
devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
