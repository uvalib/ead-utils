<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The Army must think a lot of you, even to let you organize<lb/>
your own staff. It sounds swell.</p>
<p>You will be interested to learn that the Junior Literary<lb/>
Guild, which is an outfit like the Book of the Month Club,<lb/>
or the Literary Guild, only for children, has taken Reed<lb/>
for one of its books. They don't want it, however, until<lb/>
spring, so that holds up publication again. More dough,<lb/>
though, eventually.</p>
<p>General Truby was in Philadelphia recently, and came to see<lb/>
me. He says positively that Reed was on to mosquitoes be-<lb/>
fore the Pinar del Rio episode and had seen Finlay before<lb/>
it, too, and he had a lot of circumstantial details to sup-<lb/>
port this recollection. He also thought it likely that Reed<lb/>
knew of Carter's paper, since Reed and Carter were <del><unclear></unclear></del> friends,<lb/>
without Lazear's drawing it to his notice. Another thing he<lb/>
said supported a conclusion I had arrived at: that Kissinger<lb/>
was the first volunteer, and that Moran followed after some<lb/>
very short interval. I had thought this likely, since Kissin-<lb/>
ger was given the first bite - an &ldquo;honor&rdquo; which would likely<lb/>
have been conferred on the first volunteer (unless it had some-<lb/>
thing to do with length of quarantine), and since it was of<lb/>
Kissinger that Reed made that rather fulsome remark about moral<lb/>
courage. I am thinking seriously of revising my <unclear>ms</unclear> to have<lb/>
Kissinger the first volunteer, if you should agree that this<lb/>
conclusion is probably the correct one. It does seem silly to<lb/>
perpetuate what you know to be error, and I'd like to get it<lb/>
down right. If you could take time to tell me yes you agree<lb/>
or no you don't, I'd appreciate it a lot.</p>
<p>I hope I am right today in thinking of you in Colorado Springs.<lb/>
It is simply stifling here, and I should like to think that at<lb/>
least one person I know is cool.</p>
