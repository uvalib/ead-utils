<p>Walter Reed, M.D.--In the death of Dr. Walter Reed of the<lb/>
Army, which occurred November 23, scientific medicine has<lb/>
suffered a severe loss, and the profession has been bereft of<lb/>
a constant and enthusiastic student. Walter Reed was born in<lb/>
Virginia in 1857, was graduated from the Medical Department<lb/>
of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and from Belle-<lb/>
vue Hospital Medical College, New York. He was appointed<lb/>
from Virginia to the Medical Department of the Army and was<lb/>
commissioned first-lieutenant and assistant surgeon, June 26,<lb/>
1875; five years later he was made captain and assistant sur-<lb/>
geon, and on Dec. 4, 1893, was promoted to the position of major<lb/>
and surgeon. At the time of his death he was at the head of<lb/>
the list of majors of the Medical Department of the Army.<lb/>
He made special studies in bacteriology at the Johns Hopkins<lb/>
Hospital, Baltimore, then was assigned to duty as attending<lb/>
surgeon at St. Paul, and from there was selected by the Surgeon-<lb/>
General as bacteriologist in his office, and was on duty there<lb/>
from 1893 until the outbreak of the Spanish-American War.<lb/>
During that time he was a member of the board of medical<lb/>
officers to investigate and report on the prevalence of typhoid<lb/>
fever in home camps and the commission recommended the<lb/>
plan of collecting excreta in galvanized iron tanks, which was<lb/>
afterwards successfully carried out at the U. S. General Hos-<lb/>
pital, Presidio, Cal., and was followed by cessation of the dis-<lb/>
ease. His especial work was in the line or preventive<lb/>
medicine and military hygiene. His most notable services<lb/>
to the science of medicine were those connected with<lb/>
yellow fever. He was appointed president of the board,<lb/>
the other members of which were Drs. Carroll and Agra-<lb/>
monte of the Army, which met in Cuba for the study of yellow<lb/>
fever, and their discoveries in connection with the cause and<lb/>
prevention of this disease mark an epoch in medicine. Their<lb/>
reports have already been published in THE JOURNAL and show<lb/>
the highest degree of scientific accuracy combined with excel-<lb/>
lent discrimination. Dr. Reed was operated on for appendi-<lb/>
citis on November 17, but did not rally from the operation, and<lb/>
died November 23.</p>
