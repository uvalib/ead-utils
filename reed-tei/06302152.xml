DR. PHILIP S. HENCH<lb/>
DR. CHARLES H. SLOCUMB<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I cannot adequately express my appreciation of your continued generosity<lb/>
to me. You have been so extremely helpful and kind. For a long time I haven't<lb/>
had a thrill like that which I had when the contract arrived. I have proudly<lb/>
showed it to many of my colleagues already. Temporarily, it is in my library,<lb/>
but shortly will be exhibited in the library of the Mayo Clinic. I realize that<lb/>
this is one of the finest souvenirs you have of your own military medical exper-<lb/>
iences and to think that you would give it to me makes me feel very humble and<lb/>
grateful.</p>
<p>I certainly want to thank you also for the very interesting Agramonte<lb/>
and Sternberg letters. They will be extremely useful and will be carefully pre-<lb/>
served with all of my material. Having continued my search, I have just heard<lb/>
from Mr. R. H. Brooke, Chief Clerk, Office of the Surgeon General, that the corres-<lb/>
pondence between the Yellow Fever Board and the Surgeon General and his office<lb/>
will be available for me the next time I come to Washington. It is stored in<lb/>
Fort Myers, Virginia, and I am delighted to know of it because I suspect that there<lb/>
will be much data of extreme importance, particularly some which will help us get<lb/>
the accurate dates of various activities and among other things prove the movements<lb/>
of the various members of the Board.</p>
<p>I have just had a letter from Miss Laura Wood. Doubtless, she is the<lb/>
Vassar lady whom you spoke about. I see no reason why her efforts and mine should not<lb/>
be coordinated. Certainly her book for children will not interfere with mine, and<lb/>
if you say so, I will let her have copies of much of the material that I have re-<lb/>
ceived. May I remind you that a couple of the letters of Reed that you loaned<lb/>
me had rather confidential information in them. One spoke very scathingly of the<lb/>
medical men at Pinar del Rio; another spoke disparagingly of the editors of the<lb/>
A.M.A. Do you wish me to give her copies of all the letters of Reed that you<lb/>
have sent me or shall I be selective and send her only those which I would think<lb/>
proper and helpful for her? One of the best collections of Reed's letters available<lb/>
for her is the collection of Mrs. Blossom Reed. She showed it to me. It contains<lb/>
most of the letters which she and her mother received from Reed over a period of<lb/>
many years, some of them being to Mrs. Reed even before she and Reed were engaged.<lb/>
This collection is very illustrative of his character and his activities. Unfor-<lb/>
tunately, it is incomplete when it comes to the yellow fever investigation as<lb/>
apparently Mrs. Reed did not keep copies of these letters which she gave away. Mrs.<lb/>
Blossom Reed permitted me to take some notes from these letters but of course I<lb/>
cannot let Miss Wood have them myself but will refer her to Mrs. Reed.</p>
<p>I return<lb/>
these letters<lb/>
herewith.<lb/>
They are<lb/>
most interesting<lb/>
&amp; extremely<lb/>
valuable.</p>
<p>You asked me to institute myself as &ldquo;the guardian&rdquo; of the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Roll of Honor. I shall be only too proud to accept this responsibility. However,<lb/>
I don't quite know how the attempts to get on the Roll of Honor could be called<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06302153"/>
General J. R. Kean<lb/>
- 2-<lb/>
June 26, 1941<lb/>
to my attention. Is there someone in Washington who would notify me of these<lb/>
attempts? I shall be only too glad to go to bat at any time before any senatorial<lb/>
or house committee, and keep the story straight. Thanks to the great generosity<lb/>
of yourself and others, I do think I have that story pretty straight, and I<lb/>
heartily agree with you that it is a terrible thing for outsiders to try to get<lb/>
on this Roll through political machinery. I assume that Lambert's claim was<lb/>
turned down as was that of Poucher. Lambert used to be a very good friend of<lb/>
Moran's during his Cuba days. But Moran told me confidentially a rather unhappy<lb/>
story of Lambert's activities in Panama. It seems that there was some dishonesty<lb/>
connected with Lambert's actions when he and Moran were in charge of pharmaceutical<lb/>
supplies for the army. Thereafter, Lambert and Moran parted company.</p>
<p>I am returning your copy of the Chronology and an extra copy which I<lb/>
had made for you, thinking that this would save you from sending your own out on<lb/>
some future occasion to someone else.</p>
<p>I believe I told you that Kissinger had a stroke. Mrs. Kissinger says<lb/>
that he is quite a nursing problem, as she has no help and has a very bad backache<lb/>
herself. Apparently, he is completely paralyzed on one side, has difficulty in<lb/>
speaking and also in vision. It occurred to me that if he is to be a nursing<lb/>
problem until his death, which may not be for some months or even years, the best<lb/>
solution for all concerned would be to have him admitted to a veterans' hospital<lb/>
or a general army hospital. I have not suggested this to Mrs. Kissinger, but<lb/>
I am trying to find the name of their physician to size up the situation before<lb/>
making any suggestions whatever. I do not want to get <add>too</add> mixed up in this but cer-<lb/>
tainly hope I can be helpful. What do you think of this suggestion? Assuming<lb/>
that he can be moved by train or plane, would he be admissable to Walter Reed<lb/>
Hospital or a veterans' hospital? I imagine the family physician would be very<lb/>
glad to transfer the medical responsibility because doubtless Kissinger is able<lb/>
to pay very little to his doctor.</p>
<p>Permit me to enclose a couple of photographs of yourself and General<lb/>
Ireland, and one of the hospital where you told me Walter Reed died. I am sending<lb/>
a copy to General Ireland.</p>
<p>I have Mr. Hagedorn's address and hope that I can get in touch with him<lb/>
about some information.</p>
<p>Just this morning a friend of Mrs. Blossom Reed wrote me that she (Blossom)<lb/>
was stricken last Sunday with a &ldquo;severe cardiac attack&rdquo; &amp; may be<lb/>
confined to bed for &ldquo;several months.&rdquo; This is the second tragic aftermath<lb/>
of an happy Cleveland affair! Hope I'm not next!!</p>
