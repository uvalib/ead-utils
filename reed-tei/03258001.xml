<salute>My dear Truby,</salute>
</opener>
<p>The fact that I saw, by<lb/>
accident, <unclear>in</unclear> a paper of the death<lb/>
of Agramonte, gives me an excuse<lb/>
to write to you. The paper said<lb/>
that he was a member of the<lb/>
Gorgas-Finlay board which discovered<lb/>
how Yellow Fever was transmitted<lb/>
<unclear>&amp; of course</unclear> Kean will write an<lb/>
obituary for his journal and it<lb/>
seems to me that now is the<lb/>
time to make an exact and<lb/>
final statement of Agramonte's<lb/>
position with the Reed Board-<lb/>
Kean thought at one time, <unclear>years</unclear><lb/>
<unclear>ago--</unclear> that he had done Agramonte<lb/>
an injustice when he prepared<lb/>
the <unclear>statements</unclear> of the work of the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03258002"/>
Reed Board. In view of the comments you<lb/>
made on Agramonte's speech at Detroit a year<lb/>
<unclear>ago -</unclear> and your statement of what he really did<lb/>
with the Board. I am inclined to think the<lb/>
first opinion was not <add>so</add> far off after all<lb/>
as you were so intimately associated with<lb/>
Walter Reed for a long time and have such a<lb/>
clear conception of all the details of that work<lb/>
why dont you get together with Kean and<lb/>
get a clear <unclear>statement</unclear> of what Agramonte did<lb/>
in any article that may be published - and<lb/>
incidentally in might come in handy to say what<lb/>
R.P. Ames did- just to set the record straight<lb/>
Now there - I have that off my chest</p>
<p>We drove to Tours from Paris last Monday<lb/>
and have spent 3 interesting days seeing chateau's<lb/>
of course I <unclear>showed</unclear> Mrs Ireland where we lived<lb/>
in Tours and where our offices were <unclear>I<add>t</add> was</unclear> most<lb/>
interesting to me and Mrs Ireland enjoyed it<lb/>
immensely. We saw six chateau's and will see<lb/>
a couple more when we <unclear>come</unclear> through France<lb/>
in Nov. to get our boat. We came here from<lb/>
Tours today- seeing the chateau at Blois on the<lb/>
way- Tell Kean that about 10 miles this side<lb/>
of Blois. Mrs Ireland asked me whether<lb/>
strange noise was she heard, and I told her<lb/>
it was just the echo of the yell Kean gave<lb/>
when <unclear>Edmonson</unclear> came very near running<lb/>
us into a tree, one dark <unclear>noisy</unclear> Saturday<lb/>
the later part of Sept 1918. Then he will tell<lb/>
you part of the story. I will tell you the rest when<lb/>
we have a visit some time</p>
<pb n="3" id="f03258003"/>
<p>I cant tell you <unclear>truly</unclear> what a<lb/>
wonderful time we have had<lb/>
but everyday has been a real <unclear>Celebration.</unclear><lb/>
We go to Paris tomorrow, and then<lb/>
to Rheims- <unclear>Marcheau - Normandy</unclear>.<lb/>
Mrs <unclear>Whiteland</unclear> wrote Mrs Ireland that<lb/>
rumor had it you were to <unclear>Command</unclear><lb/>
the Center. I do hope this is true, for<lb/>
it means, to my notion just one<lb/>
thing when <unclear>Misume</unclear> retires <unclear>November</unclear><lb/>
it be fine if <unclear>Rup.</unclear> should do what<lb/>
I thought ought to happen &amp; what<lb/>
I know Reynolds would have done<lb/>
if he had been made <unclear>S.G.</unclear>No- I<lb/>
<unclear>was</unclear> not saying anything about the<lb/>
recent promotion. I know it hurt your<lb/>
feelings and those of many other<lb/>
good fellows.</p>
<p>But enough. Give my love to<lb/>
Jack and those fine <unclear>pets</unclear>- Mrs<lb/>
Ireland <unclear>gives</unclear> me in best wishes<lb/>
for you and Mrs Truby</p>
