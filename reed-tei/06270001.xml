<p>Journal of Assn of Military Surgeons<lb/>
(Printer: This to go at bottom of page)</p>
<p>FROM GEN. J. R. KEAN</p>
<p>*Note by Editor: The date of the beginning of the<lb/>
warfare against Yellow Fever in Havana is epochal, and there-<lb/>
fore of interest and importance. The date, Feb. 4, 1901,<lb/>
given by General Winter, is from the final Report of Gorgas<lb/>
as Chief Sanitary Officer of Havana (dated Washington, July<lb/>
12, 1902) and it seems certain that it was a clerical error.<lb/>
The reasons for thinking so are that he was not at that time<lb/>
a convert to the mosquito theory, as formulated by Reed, and<lb/>
in other articles he gives a later date. In the same report,<lb/>
he states (page 3):</p>
<p>&ldquo;In February, 1901, Dr. Reed read a paper before<lb/>
the International Sanitary Congress in Habana giving<lb/>
the results of their work. The idea was so new and<lb/>
so entirely contrary to all former theories on the<lb/>
subject, and apparently to all former experience that<lb/>
the paper was received with scanty belief. I myself<lb/>
had seen the work and was convinced that the mosquito<lb/>
<hi>could convey</hi> yellow fever but I was hardly prepared<lb/>
to believe that it was the only way <hi>or even the ordin-<lb/>
ary way</hi> of conveying the disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a pamphlet prepared at the request of Surgeon<lb/>
General O'Reilly for distribution to Medical and Sanitary<lb/>
Officers (A Few General Directions with Regard to Destroying<lb/>
Mosquitoes, particularly the Yellow Fever Mosquito. By W. C.<lb/>
Gorgas, Col. M.C., U.S. Army, Gov. Printing Office, 1904),<lb/>
Colonel Gorgas states (page 10 speaking of house inspections<lb/>
for breeding places):</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the first report on this subject, I think it<lb/>
was in March, 1901, we found that we had in Havana in<lb/>
the neighborhood of 26,000 different water deposite<lb/>
which contained wigglers, most of them of the yellow<lb/>
fever variety. ****** The report of January, 1902, after<lb/>
about <hi>ten months</hi> of this mosquito work showed that<lb/>
within the city limits less than 300 premises had<lb/>
wigglers upon them&rdquo;. (Italics in above quotations<lb/>
are the Editor's)</p>
<p>Reed gives the date of beginning work as February<lb/>
15, and this doubtless refers to the formulation of plans at<lb/>
Sanitary Headquarters rather than the activities of mosquito<lb/>
squads in the patios of Havana. It is a safe bet that any<lb/>
physical attack on the mosquito in the City of Havana before<lb/>
the first of March, 1901 was limited to the ancient and auto-<lb/>
matic manual response to the stimulus of a bite.</p>
