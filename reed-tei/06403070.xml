<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was pleased to get your letter of September 1 enclosing the<lb/>
copy of Walter Reed's New Years Eve letter to his wife in 1900. I <del><unclear></unclear></del><lb/>
was also very much pleased to see the photograph of the group around<lb/>
the ambulance at Camp Lazear. That was very familiar to me. I am<lb/>
returning the photograph with remarks on the back of it. No. 2 is<lb/>
certainly Dr. Cooke. I am quite sure that No. 3 is Jernegan. No. 4<lb/>
is, I am quite sure, <add>acting <unclear>Servant</unclear></add> Kissinger. The picture certainly looks exactly<lb/>
like Kissinger's outline and is not at all like the two other acting<lb/>
stewards we had in Cuba. No. 6 is evidently a young officer in a blue<lb/>
flannel shirt and officer's blue uniform cap. I have no idea who it<lb/>
is. After studying this photograph a long time, I am almost certain<lb/>
that No. 7 is Walter Reed himself, although I never saw Walter Reed<lb/>
wear civilian clothes in Cuba. This was evidently one of those cold<lb/>
days there when woolen uniforms felt comfortable. If that is<lb/>
Kissinger in the picture it means that this photograph was taken<lb/>
late in December or in January, for Kissinger was promoted after his<lb/>
attack of Yellow Fever. Reed probably had no blue uniforms with <unclear>him</unclear>,<lb/>
but had civilian clothes to wear after he left the boat in New York<lb/>
on his way to Washington. The three men <del>with</del> (No. 10) look exactly<lb/>
like the Spanish volunteers. The boys were evidently their friends<lb/>
who could visit them at that place. I hope you will get Dr. Cooke<lb/>
to express his views and you should also <del>write to</del><add><unclear>ask</unclear></add> the Reed family if<lb/>
7 is really Reed.</p>
<p><unclear>noted his chevrons</unclear></p>
<p>Do you still have Walter Reed's letters, and were there any more<lb/>
comments in them about me? I would certainly like to have a photo-<lb/>
stat copy of those nice remarks he made about me in his letter of<lb/>
November 20, '99.</p>
<p>I know your professional work is keeping you busy and you do not<lb/>
have much time for this hobby of yours. I think your interview with<lb/>
Kean on January 6, '44 is really important and my comments on Kean's<lb/>
replies to your questionnaire are important too. I would like to<lb/>
know what Kean thinks about the Sibley stove suggestion of mine and<lb/>
I would also like to know his comments on the funerals <del><unclear></unclear></del>.<lb/>
Won't you send it to him and have him comment on the margin. Are you<lb/>
making any progress with young Carroll about getting those notebooks.<lb/>
I think he would sell them.</p>
<p>I am feeling very well, but as you know progress after a certain<lb/>
stage is terribly slow. I am enclosing a <xref id="f06403072">letter</xref> from Lawrence Reed<lb/>
about my book which I thought you would be interested in seeing. I<lb/>
have the original so you need not return this copy.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>

I am sorry I mutitated the photo- I found it<lb/>
would not go in the envelope and so cut off<lb/>
the top &amp; bottom, forgetting that I had written on<lb/>
the back, So I patched it up-<lb/>
I have just had a nice letter from Dr <unclear>Hewitt</unclear><lb/>
enclosing a newspaper clipping about Moran's<lb/>
visit to Rochester. It was very nice and us<lb/>
doubt you have a copy.<lb/>
