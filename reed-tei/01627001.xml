<salute>My darling Emilie,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I hasten to an-<lb/>
swer your sweet letter, if, per-<lb/>
chance, I may be able to relieve<lb/>
your mind of a part of its anx-<lb/>
iety. After reading your letter, I<lb/>
was strongly tempted to sit<lb/>
down, at once, &amp; write to my moth-<lb/>
er such a letter as would re-<lb/>
main green in her memory for<lb/>
many years to come. But don't be<lb/>
frightened! I have not written<lb/>
one word to her, nor do I intend<lb/>
to write anything on the subject of<lb/>
her letter. For <hi>your sake</hi>, my darl-<lb/>
ing, I forbear. Pray, don't think that<lb/>
I am at all out of humor or vex-<lb/>
ed in the least with ma. This latest<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01627002"/>
stretch of her imagination is no nov-<lb/>
elty to me. Some people like to<lb/>
conjure up strange stories &amp;<lb/>
to use them, innocently as they<lb/>
suppose, for the attainment of<lb/>
their purposes; and my mother,<lb/>
(bless her sweet soul!) may be<lb/>
numbered among those. The fact of<lb/>
the <del>f</del> matter is, so much does she<lb/>
grieve over her late separation<lb/>
from you, her dearest friend, and<lb/>
now doubly dear; and so much<lb/>
does she long to have you under<lb/>
her own roof, and that right<lb/>
quickly, that she would use al-<lb/>
most any means to pursuade<lb/>
you to visit Harrisonburg. While<lb/>
I was at my sister's, she wrote<lb/>
me that she was going to write<lb/>
to you to come to Harrisonburg &amp;<lb/>
that she would not accept a<lb/>
negative answer; that you would<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01627003"/>
have to come, <hi>at all hazards</hi>. I am<lb/>
sure that she did not attach as<lb/>
great an import to her words, as<lb/>
you have put upon them. She had<lb/>
no idea that it would make you so<lb/>
unhappy to be told that we must<lb/>
be separated for several years.<lb/>
She merely desired to use what<lb/>
she considered to be a good<lb/>
argument to <del>compel</del><add>lead</add> you to visit her.<lb/>
Again, she said, <del>that,</del> now that we<lb/>
are engaged, she did not see that<lb/>
it would be any breach of eti-<lb/>
quette, for you to come to H. while<lb/>
I was there! Well, now my darling<lb/>
Emilie, doesn't this prove to you<lb/>
that she looks through rather<lb/>
<hi>ancient spectacles</hi>, and not<lb/>
through youthful glasses? But I<lb/>
am very happy to see that you<lb/>
have the good sense to know<lb/>
better- As much as I love <add>you</add> &amp; as<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01627004"/>
dearly as <add>I</add> would prize your visit,<lb/>
yet I had rather be absent from<lb/>
you three long years, than that<lb/>
you should go over the mountain<lb/>
during my stay at home! It<lb/>
would never do, my darling. It would<lb/>
appear in the eyes of the people<lb/>
of Murfreesboro as nothing else<lb/>
than a silly desire to see me!<lb/>
Although <hi>I</hi> would know that such<lb/>
was <hi>not</hi> the case, still <hi>that</hi> is<lb/>
the construction <hi>they</hi> would put<lb/>
upon it; and sooner than <hi>one<lb/>
harsh</hi> word should be uttered<lb/>
against <hi>your</hi> actions by an unthink-<lb/>
ing Public, I would lose my right<lb/>
arm! No! my darling, your view of<lb/>
the matter is entirely the correct one,<lb/>
and I had already written as much<lb/>
to my mother. Next summer, when<lb/>
I am away from home, I shall<lb/>
expect you to visit my parents<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01627005"/>
and spend several months with<lb/>
them. They love you devotedly &amp; <add>would</add> gladly<lb/>
welcome you to their home. <hi>E're many<lb/>
summers</hi> have taken their flight, I trust<lb/>
that affairs will have taken <hi>such a<lb/>
course</hi> that you will be able to visit<lb/>
H'burg, regardless of comments. I know<lb/>
if you will listen to my prayers, <add>that</add> those<lb/>
summers will be <hi>very few indeed</hi>,<lb/>
so that, although I should not see you<lb/>
again before that time, the <hi>separation<lb/>
would be very short</hi>. But this leads<lb/>
me to speak of the probable length<lb/>
of time that will elapse before I<lb/>
next visit Murfreesboro. I think<lb/>
your letter, darling, contains suf-<lb/>
ficient cause for me to murmur a<lb/>
little, <hi>but I will not</hi>- I love you too<lb/>
dearly to allow any murmuring to es-<lb/>
cape my lips. Could you believe,<lb/>
<del>that</del>, after all my declarations of<lb/>
honesty, that I had concealed one<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01627006"/>
word or even a thought from you?<lb/>
How gladly I read the sentence; &ldquo;No, no,<lb/>
I will not believe that you would<lb/>
have kept the knowledge of it from me&rdquo;.<lb/>
God bless you, my darling, nor will<lb/>
I <hi>ever</hi> keep my plans &amp; purposes<lb/>
from you! If I had failed to re-<lb/>
veal aught to you, quickly would I<lb/>
hasten to throw myself at your<lb/>
feet &amp; beg that you would reject<lb/>
one so unworthy of your love.<lb/>
I told you that I <hi>hoped</hi> to see you<lb/>
within 6 months, or at least, one<lb/>
year from this time- You will remem-<lb/>
ber that I said that I was igno-<lb/>
rant as to the rules of the Army<lb/>
on this particular point; that it<lb/>
m<del>e</del>ight be even a <hi>longer</hi> time, and<lb/>
this I told you <hi>before</hi> you accep-<lb/>
ted me. You know that afterward,<lb/>
I laughingly said that it might be<lb/>
three or four years! If I am<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01627007"/>
incorrect in any of these state-<lb/>
ments, I beg that you will correct<lb/>
me. I tried to be especially plain on<lb/>
this point, so that you could not<lb/>
possibly misunderstand me. If I have<lb/>
mislead you, I want to be held to<lb/>
the strictest accountability. I could <add>not</add>,<lb/>
for a moment, rest contented under<lb/>
the idea that I had deceived you.<lb/>
<hi>I could bear anything better than<lb/>
this</hi>! You will, also, recall the fact,<lb/>
that I said I would write to N.Y.<lb/>
&amp; find out all I could on the subject.<lb/>
This I did <hi>before</hi> leaving Murfreesbo-<lb/>
ro. On my arrival here, I found a<lb/>
letter from my friend, Dr Torney,<lb/>
awaiting me. He stated that he had<lb/>
not been able to see Dr Hoff, &amp; hence<lb/>
could not tell me much- He only<lb/>
knew that in the Navy it was<lb/>
not easy for a young officer to<lb/>
obtain leave of absence very<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01627008"/>
soon after entering the service,<lb/>
but that it was the invariable cus-<lb/>
tom to grant a leave to a man <del>who</del><lb/>
for the purpose of <hi>getting married!</hi><lb/>
This is certainly <hi>some</hi> consolation!<lb/>
In order to find out all concerning<lb/>
the matter, I will write <hi>this after-<lb/>
noon</hi>, to Dr Hoff &amp; will write you, at<lb/>
once, on the arrival of <del>your</del> his letter.<lb/>
If it should turn out that it will be<lb/>
impossible for me to see you for 2 or<lb/>
3 years (a fact of which I am, at present,<lb/>
<hi>totally ignorant</hi>, &amp; of which I have<lb/>
<hi>never written or said one word to<lb/>
my mother</hi>) either we will have to<lb/>
bear the separation as content-<lb/>
edly as is possible, or else, my<lb/>
darling, you will have to make<lb/>
up your mind to get married soon-<lb/>
er than you had expected- I do<lb/>
<add>not</add> expect to be separated from you<lb/>
very long. Certainly, if I found that<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01627009"/>
<del>that</del> the time would be longer than<lb/>
2 years, I could not possibly sub-<lb/>
mit to it- You are too precious to<lb/>
my heart to be absent from me<lb/>
longer than that!</p>
<p>But I'll not <del>write</del><add>fill</add> all my letter<lb/>
with separations &amp; absences-<lb/>
While I think of it, I will speak<lb/>
of a matter which I had intended<lb/>
speaking to you about several<lb/>
times during my visit &amp; which I<lb/>
had as often forgotten. I refer<lb/>
to an engagement ring. It was<lb/>
my intention, if it was agreeable<lb/>
to you, to delay purchasing one, till<lb/>
I knew whether I was going to be<lb/>
assigned to duty in New York<lb/>
or not. My reason for this is that<lb/>
if assigned to the latter place, I<lb/>
could get just such a ring as<lb/>
would suit me with much less<lb/>
difficulty than I <del>at</del><add>could</add> in any<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01627010"/>
Southern city. What think <add>you</add> of this?<lb/>
I want to have your opinion on<lb/>
this matter, for I do not intend<lb/>
doing anything without first con-<lb/>
sulting your wishes.</p>
<p>I have been spending my time<lb/>
very pleasantly at my brother's -- am<lb/>
very much pleased with my sis-<lb/>
ter- Have been eating straw-<lb/>
berries 3 times a day, &amp; <hi>between<lb/>
meals</hi>, ever since my arrival-<lb/>
Many thanks for your sweet pho-<lb/>
tograph- it is excellent, but I can't<lb/>
obey you by <hi>destroying</hi> the other<lb/>
one -- my hand would fall power-<lb/>
less at my side! Besides I will<lb/>
now have <hi>two</hi> instead of <hi>one</hi> to<lb/>
put under my pillow, at night!<lb/>
Am so glad to hear that your lame-<lb/>
ness is better. As some young ladies<lb/>
have arrived &amp; are calling for me to play<lb/>
croquet &amp; as my paper is at an end, I will<lb/>
close-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, darling, as ever, your devoted<lb/>
</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
<seg>
I leave here, Tuesday, June 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- If you write before that time, direct to Portsmouth, Va-<lb/>
I shall expect a letter when I get to Portsmouth- Fondly, yours, Walter.<lb/>
Received the postal card -- much obliged- <hi>W</hi>.<lb/>
P.S. my brother &amp; sister send love.
