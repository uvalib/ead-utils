<salute>My darling wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here it is<lb/>
Friday evening &amp; I haven't written<lb/>
a word to the sweet little wo-<lb/>
man who wrote me such a<lb/>
nice letter, last saturday. That<lb/>
letter was a little more like<lb/>
your darling self -- although you<lb/>
keep harping on &ldquo;those bills&rdquo;,-<lb/>
Do pray let up on that subject,<lb/>
sweetheart- So you really heard<lb/>
that &ldquo;yarn&rdquo; from poor, good<lb/>
old Beehner? I thought that it<lb/>
would reach you and lead<lb/>
to your being disappointed- It<lb/>
was really too bad, my precious<lb/>
heart, but your &ldquo;Mosquito&rdquo;- was<lb/>
not to blame, this time- I am<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02414002"/>
glad the check arrived prompt-<lb/>
ly and had hoped that it would<lb/>
cheer you up a wee<del>t</del> bit-<lb/>
Just keep away from Wood-<lb/>
ward and Lothrop for a while<lb/>
and your bank account will<lb/>
begin to increase, especially<lb/>
as you don't have to send any-<lb/>
thing to Johnnie Moore. Between<lb/>
those <hi>two</hi>, we manage, lovie, dear,<lb/>
to spend most of our spare<lb/>
change- But we did so well<lb/>
last year, dearest oomsey, that we<lb/>
ought to feel encouraged very<lb/>
much. I think that we can<lb/>
add <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>1200.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> to that other <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>700.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi>, this<lb/>
year- You just see if we don't!<lb/>
I know that you were rejoiced<lb/>
to see that rosy-cheeked daughter<lb/>
come &ldquo;moseying&rdquo; back from<lb/>
An<add>n</add>apolis- (I don't know <hi>why</hi> I<lb/>
will persist in spelling that word<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02414003"/>
with one n.) I didn't write on<lb/>
yesterday, because Cap't. Slocum<lb/>
invited me to go 15 miles into<lb/>
the Country with him and I couldn't<lb/>
well refuse- we drove through<lb/>
a very pretty part of the Island,<lb/>
and I did wish so much for my darl-<lb/>
ing wifie, that she might see<lb/>
some of the pretty views- But<lb/>
I can't let my precious <add>Miss</add> Gouty<lb/>
travel on the ocean at this<lb/>
season of the year. No, no, my<lb/>
sweetheart, you could never<lb/>
stand it- You can get along<lb/>
and be happy without seeing<lb/>
this <del>part of the</del> Island just<lb/>
now. I wish that I owned<lb/>
5 acres near the ocean here,<lb/>
for we could make it a veri-<lb/>
table paradise, but our sweet<lb/>
Keewaydin is pretty enough<lb/>
for us &amp; we can find need<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02414004"/>
for all of our spare cash<lb/>
there- I am simply frantic for<lb/>
spring to come so that we can<lb/>
run up there &amp; see those darling<lb/>
trees sprout out in the woodland,<lb/>
and to make that garden grow<lb/>
once more- Their my precious<lb/>
wifie will get all of those gou-<lb/>
ty humors out of her and be able<lb/>
to run around and be merry<lb/>
once more- You had better keep<lb/>
your &ldquo;weather eye&rdquo; open for a<lb/>
good cook and bottle-washer!<lb/>
Somebody told me, this afternoon,<lb/>
that Mrs. Barden had come down<lb/>
to Havana, but that she didn't<lb/>
like it very much- Am glad that<lb/>
you saw Lt. Cooke- I wish that<lb/>
I could get down to see Dar-<lb/>
boy before I leave, but am<lb/>
afraid that I won't be able to<lb/>
do so- Dear me! I am getting sleepy,<lb/>
but <hi>must</hi> answer little joy's an-<lb/>
napolis letter before I go to bed-<lb/>
Boo! Boo! and sweet dreams. You joys!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02414005"/>
<hi>Saturday morning 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>- my watch<lb/>
says 5 minutes after seven, so<lb/>
that I have overslept my-<lb/>
self and don't know whether the<lb/>
mail man has been here<lb/>
or not- <hi>If he has</hi>, won't<lb/>
it be too bad, as my Sweet<lb/>
Joy won't get her letter!<lb/>
Dear me! sweetheart, I<lb/>
am <hi>awfully sorry</hi>! It's all<lb/>
my own sleepy-headed<lb/>
fault! yah! yah!- <hi>I was<lb/>
only joking</hi>! Here he<lb/>
comes now &amp; I am in<lb/>
very good time- Besides,<lb/>
I am going to drive into<lb/>
Havana, this morning, &amp;<lb/>
can <hi>mail</hi> it there without<lb/>
any trouble- He! He! Ho! Ho!<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02414006"/>
Do you know how much your<lb/>
dear Mantee weighs in his<lb/>
light summer cloths? Just<lb/>
<hi>148</hi> lbs! What do you think<lb/>
of that? Pretty good weight<lb/>
to begin a Century with,<lb/>
don't you think so? I never<lb/>
weighed so much in my life,<lb/>
and if I had good things to<lb/>
eat, I would weigh 160 lbs!<lb/>
My <hi>cheeks</hi> fairly <hi>stick out</hi>,<lb/>
&amp; as for <hi>my stomach</hi>, why<lb/>
it resembles that of a<lb/>
Washington Brewer!<lb/>
Good-bye, you precious<lb/>
children- Love &amp; kisses<lb/>
for my darling, darling<lb/>
girls-</p>
