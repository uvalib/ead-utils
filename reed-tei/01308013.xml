<p>Carter, Henry Rose, physician, was born at Clifton<lb/>
Plantation, Caroline County. Va., Aug. 25, 1852<unclear>,</unclear> son of Henry Rose and Emma<lb/>
Caroline (Coleman) Carter. John Carter, his earliest American ancestor, came<lb/>
over from <unclear>Garston</unclear> Manor. Hertfordshire, England, in 1649, settling at Coroto-<lb/>
man, Lancaster County, Va. and the line of <unclear>descent</unclear> from him and his wife,<lb/>
Sarah Ludlowe, is through their son Robert Carter (<unclear>q</unclear>. v.) and his wife Judith<lb/>
Armistead; John and Elizabeth Hill; Edward and Sarah (Champe); and Hill and<lb/>
Mary (Rose) who were Dr. Carter's grandparents. His father was U. S. com-<lb/>
missioner to the Indians and an early settler of Mississippi. The son was<lb/>
graduated with the degree of C. E. at the University of Virginia in 1873,<lb/>
and returned there for one year as Assistant in Applied Mathematics. His<lb/>
medical degree was received at the College of Medicine of the University of<lb/>
Maryland in 1879. He began the practice of medicine at Baltimore, Md. in<lb/>
partnership with Dr. Frank West, but soon entered the Marine Hospital Ser-<lb/>
vice of the United States as Assistant Surgeon. In 1888 he was sent to<lb/>
Ship Island quarantine station in the Gulf of Mexico, where he began the<lb/>
study of yellow fever, in the control and prevention of which he became a<lb/>
world authority. There were at that time no uniform regulations for quar-<lb/>
antine at American ports, or reliable data upon which to base them. Dr.<lb/>
Carter deduced the fact that six days covered the maximum period of incu-<lb/>
bation in man and counted this period from the completion of disinfection<lb/>
of the vessel. He was promoted to the rank of passed assistant surgeon<lb/>
in 1882, of surgeon in 1892 and senior surgeon in 1912. On March 4, 1915<lb/>
he was made assistant surgeon general by special act of Congress. In the<lb/>
last decade of the nineteenth century, he was sent to various points in<lb/>
Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana and other Southern States to combat epidemic<unclear><del>s</del></unclear><lb/>

epidemics of yellow fever and contracted the disease himself. His work at<lb/>
McHenry, Miss., in 1898 resulted in the first suppression of a yellow fever<lb/>
epidemic in the South in the summer time. In 1899 he was made chief quaran-<lb/>
tine officer of Cuba and in 1904 was detailed for duty at Panama, at both<lb/>
places inaugurating the quarantine service. He was also director of hospi-<lb/>
tals at Panama and remained there five years. In 1913 he conducted the first<lb/>
successful campaign for the control of malaria made in the United States,<lb/>
and from then, until his retirement in 1919, he was engaged in combatting<lb/>
malaria in the South. During the World War, he inaugurated control measures<lb/>
for malaria in the extra-cantonment areas of the camps and in the regions<lb/>
around the large industrial plants engaged in the production of war material.<lb/>
He was sanitary advisor to the Peruvian Government in 1920-<unclear><del>and=</del></unclear> 21 and a<lb/>
member of the yellow fever commission of the Rockefeller Foundation 1915-25.<lb/>
He was author of nearly forty papers published in public health reports and<lb/>
medical journals, sections on yellow fever in &ldquo;The Practice of Medicine in<lb/>
the Tropics,&rdquo; Abt's &ldquo;System of Pediatrics&rdquo; and the "Nelson Loose Leaf Medi-<lb/>
cine. His various intellectual interests included mathematics, ethnology,<lb/>
languages and literature, with a special fondness for poetry. Steadfast-<lb/>
ness of purpose, unlimited endurance and enthusiasm in the service of<lb/>
humanity were his dominating characteristics. He was a member of the<lb/>
National Malaria Committee of which he was secretary and honorary president;<lb/>
The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, <del>and</del><add><unclear>but</unclear></add> the Canal Zone<lb/>
Medical Society, <add>and fellow of the Royal Society of <unclear>tracks-feed.</unclear> &amp; Hygiene</add> and of the Academy of Medicine, Caracas, Venezuela. He<lb/>
was married, Sept. 29, 1880, to Laura Eugenia, daughter of Henry Hook of<lb/>
Belleville, Ill., by whom he had three children, Henry Rose, a physician,<lb/>
Edward Champe, an author and musician, and Laura Armistead Carter, who as-<lb/>
sisted her father in his scientific work. He died in Washington, D. C.,<lb/>
September 14, 1925.</p>
<p>Also author of a <unclear>postmores</unclear> book, undertaken at the request of,<lb/>
