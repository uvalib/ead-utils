<salute>Dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This past Thursday and Friday, Mr. D. J. Withington, and<lb/>
myself, both of John Wyeth and Brother, Incorporated, Philadelphia,<lb/>
spent some time with Dr. Philip F. Hench at which time he looked<lb/>
over some sketches painted by Mr. Dean Cornwell in preparation for<lb/>
our new painting, &ldquo;The Conquest of Yellow Fever&rdquo;. You may or may<lb/>
not have heard of the series of paintings which John Wyeth and<lb/>
Brother are sponsoring under the name of &ldquo;Pioneers of American<lb/>
Medicine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Dr. Hench had very kindly invited us to see him when he<lb/>
had heard that the picture was in preparation. As it proved, he<lb/>
had much valuable material for us to read and many splendid sugges-<lb/>
tions on the production of the picture. In fact we, on his sugges-<lb/>
tion, are going to have the locale changed from the patio of Dr.<lb/>
Finley's home to the <del><unclear>ours</unclear></del><add>porch</add> of the officers' quarters at Camp<lb/>
Columbia. I believe that Dr. Hench will have written you before<lb/>
you receive this letter. I took some photographs of the sketches<lb/>
which I left with him before they were developed, so at the moment<lb/>
I don't know whether I got anything or not.</p>
<p>The problem the artist is up against at the present in-<lb/>
volves getting the answers to certain questions, which I am going<lb/>
to ask you in this letter, hoping that you will be willing to help<lb/>
us in this project.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. Were these buildings at Camp Columbia painted and if<lb/>
so in what color?</item>
<item>2. Would you give us the approximate size of Dr. Lazear's<lb/>
little note book, which played such a prominent part in influencing<lb/>
Dr. Reed to continue the research?</item>
<item>3. When feeding the mosquitoes would Dr. Carroll and Dr.<lb/>
Lazear have taken off their military coats and rolled up their shirt-<lb/>
sleeves for it. If so, what type of shirt would they have been<lb/>
wearing. Would it have been white or khaki color?</item>

<item>February 18, 1941</item>
<item>4. Were the army nurses in white uniforms?</item>
<item>5. Is it possible that Miss Clara Maas had been out at<lb/>
Camp Columbia during the time that Carroll and Lazear were doing<lb/>
their early experimental work.</item>
</list></p>
<p>I am asking this last question because it is possible<lb/>
that the artist would like to have the relief of a woman's figure<lb/>
in the picture in contrast to all the men, which will of necessity<lb/>
have to dominate it.</p>
<p>Dr. Hench suggested that you might be willing to lend us<lb/>
a copy of the portion of your diary which concerns Lazear's death<lb/>
and the discovery of the note book. If you can do this, I am sure<lb/>
it would be quite helpful to Mr. Cornwell.</p>
<p>For your information the completed painting will be<lb/>
approximately four by six feet in size and will be reproduced in<lb/>
full color for free distribution to physicians.</p>
<p>Any help that you can give us will be sincerely appreciated.</p>
