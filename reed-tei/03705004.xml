<salute>My dear Senora Rodriguez-Leon:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I leave tomorrow for a series of medical meetings, and have been so<lb/>
busy preparing for them that I have not had time to write you since my return<lb/>
from the Washington and Jefferson affair.</p>
<p>The dedication of the Lazear Memorial Building was very fine. The<lb/>
ceremony was most dignified and impressive, and the building is a beautiful<lb/>
one. There was quite a crowd there, and my talk at the banquet Saturday evening<lb/>
was most sympathetically received. Three relatives of Dr. Lazear were present<lb/>
and were so interested in all that I had to say. Mrs. Lazear was unable to be<lb/>
there herself, but I had written her of the affair and sent her a copy of my<lb/>
paper. She was simply delighted to know what had been discovered. She did<lb/>
not know that any of what you told me and one could appreciate how delighted<lb/>
she was to know that her husband's sacrifice was in behalf of science and not<lb/>
due to an accidental &ldquo;blunder&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think the enclosed clipping will interest you, and when I return<lb/>
from the medical meetings and catch my breath, I will write you further as to<lb/>
my plans for memorializing the true site of Camp Lazear and Building No. 1.<lb/>
I plan to publish my Washington talk which, however, will be merely the first<lb/>
of several papers on the affair, and I will certainly send you as many reprints<lb/>
of the Washington talk and others as you may wish. Doubtless, some friends<lb/>
of your father's will be most interest in knowing what you have told me.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
