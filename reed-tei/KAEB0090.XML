<salute>My dear Dr Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>If any one<lb/>
had foretold that I would<lb/>
so utterly neglect my much<lb/>
esteemed friend, the Key West-<lb/>
ian Post Surgeon, I would<lb/>
have said indignantly, &ldquo;man,<lb/>
thou liest&rdquo;! And yet! and<lb/>
yet! how frail is poor<lb/>
human nature! and how<lb/>
evanescent are &ldquo;good intentions&rdquo;!<lb/>
Certainly, I have contributed<lb/>
my share to Hell's side-walks;<lb/>
if there be sidewalks there.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fKAEB0100"/>
Your charming letter, my dear<lb/>
Doctor, of September 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, now<lb/>
lies open before me and silently<lb/>
accuses me of my neglect and<lb/>
general good-for-nothingness.<lb/>
How much I enjoyed that letter,<lb/>
I cannot <del>tell</del> begin to tell<lb/>
you. To learn that you were<lb/>
financially &ldquo;busted&rdquo; was<lb/>
simply a giddy delight! for<lb/>
I am always in that condition,<lb/>
and &ldquo;misery does so&rdquo; &amp;c<lb/>
I knew that you could not be<lb/>
with us, this winter, delving<lb/>
away at things bacterial;<lb/>
otherwise, I should have <add>been</add> dis-<lb/>
tressed beyond degree to hear<lb/>
that you were not in a<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fKAEB0110"/> 
16 to 1 condition! you probably<lb/>
voted for the wrong man!<lb/>
However, your poverty, though<lb/>
very pleasing, did not give<lb/>
me that excess of delight<lb/>
which followed the knowledge<lb/>
that I had sown a little<lb/>
seed <del>that</del><add>which</add> had &ldquo;fallen in good<lb/>
ground&rdquo;! I think Mrs. Kean's<lb/>
expression to Martha that &ldquo;her<lb/>
feelings were sticking out<lb/>
on all sides like pseudo=<lb/>
pods&rdquo;, has given me more<lb/>
real happiness and general<lb/>
comfort than anything that<lb/>
has happened during the last<lb/>
twenty years! Although pseu=<lb/>
dopods are not pointed, the ex=<lb/>
pression was so much to the point<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="fKAEB0120"/> 
and so picturesque and<lb/>
so illustrative of the general<lb/>
tendency on the part of your<lb/>
dear lady to blend the scientific<lb/>
with the every day affairs of<lb/>
life, that the mind feels buoy=<lb/>
-ed up and more hopeful<lb/>
of the ultimate conversion<lb/>
of the world to science!<lb/>
Not that Martha, the dear<lb/>
little creature, was really<lb/>
irritable - that would be<lb/>
impossible, unless she inherits<lb/>
a slight tendency in that di=<lb/>
rection from some great,<lb/>
great grandfather! In all<lb/>
probability, a mosquito was<lb/>
secretedly knawing at her<lb/>
vitals and this was only a<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="fKAEB0130"/> 
2)<lb/>
WAR DEPARTMENT,<lb/>
SURGEON GENERAL'S OFFICE,<lb/>
ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM AND LIBRARY,<lb/>
WASHINGTON.<lb/>
slight reflex response to<lb/>
some hidden irritation!<lb/>
I did not endorse at all<lb/>
what you said about D<hi rend="sup">r</hi><lb/>
<unclear>Cleau Dommini's</unclear> introduction<lb/>
to the fruit of Heaven! I don't<lb/>
see that he has done such<lb/>
great things as to be entitled<lb/>
to this ecstatic bliss! No,<lb/>
honestly, I'd see him <unclear>d-d</unclear><lb/>
before he or any body else<lb/>
should even as much as<lb/>
look upon that joy-compelling<lb/>
food, if <hi>I were King</hi>!!</p>
<p>However, you know my<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="fKAEB0140"/>
sentiments, <add>on this subject</add>, and that I would ex=<lb/>
clude from that excess of pun-<lb/>
ishment, above mentioned, my<lb/>
particular friends at Key West!<lb/>
The S. G. did say that the change<lb/>
in your station would be<lb/>
made &ldquo;in the spring&rdquo;- Perhaps<lb/>
he meant during the Key West-<lb/>
ian spring, which <add>I</add> suppose<lb/>
begins in January. I doubt<lb/>
not that you will arrive at<lb/>
the &ldquo;Hub&rdquo;, at just about the<lb/>
season when the buds are<lb/>
enlarging and the little birds<lb/>
are beginning to call each other<lb/>
from the half-verdant tree-tops.<lb/>
And with the accumulated<lb/>
gold of some half year in<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="fKAEB0150"/>
your breeches pocket, what<lb/>
a &ldquo;galorious&rdquo; <add> time</add> you and your<lb/>
charming lady will have! I<lb/>
really envy you!</p>
<p>your friend, Col.<lb/>
Bache, was President of our<lb/>
Board. I gave him your mes-<lb/>
sage which he was very glad<lb/>
to receive - evidently remembers<lb/>
you very kindly - Indeed, he paid<lb/>
you some compliments which<lb/>
I shall withhold - He is a very<lb/>
agreeable gentleman and im=<lb/>
pressed us all favorably - I am<lb/>
so sorry, my dear Doctor, that I can=<lb/>
not send you the questions to which<lb/>
you refer. The law requires that<lb/>
they shall all be destroyed in the<lb/>
presence of the Board - very silly<lb/>
requirement, but true. I will<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="fKAEB0160"/>
only say that they embraced all<lb/>
that is contained in the Practice<lb/>
of Med.&amp; Surgery &amp; Hygiane, both<lb/>
ancient and modern! During all<lb/>
of October we struggled with the help-<lb/>
less candidates who presented<lb/>
themselves, and at last called out<lb/>
eight. The wretches! I hear them<lb/>
this very minute, as they rattle<lb/>
the plates &amp; test-tubes across<lb/>
the Hall, in frantic efforts to<lb/>
isolate the wily bacillus in<lb/>
pure culture! They will yet<lb/>
be the death of me! With these in<lb/>
the mornings and <unclear>Fitz.</unclear> Carter &amp; Arthur<lb/>
in the afternoons, my hands are<lb/>
full. Do you wonder that I neglect<lb/>
my best friends? Mrs. Reed joins me<lb/>
in kindest regards to Mr. Kean &amp; your-<lb/>
self - for myself, I don't send &ldquo;regards&rdquo;<lb/>
but my best love to both of you, not<lb/>
forgetting dear little Martha. Please write<lb/>
again.</p>

<salute>Your sincere friend,</salute>
