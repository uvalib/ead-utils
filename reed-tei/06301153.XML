2804 N St. N.W.<lb/>
Washington, D.C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I've had the pleasure of receiving your very nice letter and<lb/>
hurry on to answer with deep gratitude, for in it you again ex-<lb/>
press your great feelings and your just way of thinking.</p>
<p>Very interesting what you explain about memory--Naturally I<lb/>
agree with you that when one has written reports that makes<lb/>
things final.</p>
<p>I'll first refer to the San Jose Farm belonging to Dr. L.G. Rojas<lb/>
which you call Camp Lazear. I had no knowledge of the fact<lb/>
that Americans designated the farm thus for I knew San Jos&eacute;<lb/>
Farm as the first place used for Reed Commission work. I went<lb/>
there a few times with Reed, Carrol, <hi rend="underline">Lazear</hi> and saw the Barrack <add>he was dead! PSH</add><lb/>
that was constructed for experiments with infested cloth and<lb/>
laboratory work on the bacilus icteroides. A short time after<lb/>
the Commission demonstrated the non-existence of this bacillus<lb/>
with the various experiments. Then after this, quite a while<lb/>
later, the meeting took place celebrated by you, Major Gorgas,<lb/>
so esteemed among us, and Gral. Wood who placed at your disposal<lb/>
the amount of $10.000 to start the experiments with the theory<lb/>
of Dr. Finlay. After took place the meeting with Dr. Finlay,<lb/>
Reed, you and Gorgas. The preliminary speech by Dr. Reed in<lb/>
said meeting was published in &ldquo;Philadelphia Journal&rdquo; of Oct. 27,<lb/>
1900. It reads thus: &ldquo;We wish to express our most sincere thanks<lb/>
to Dr. Finlay for the delightful interview he gave us and for<lb/>
placing at our disposal his diverse publications on Yellow Fever<lb/>
during the past 20 years and also the eggs of the species of<lb/>
mosquitos with which he had made his several incubations. With<lb/>
them, that is, with the mosquitos obtained in this manner, we<lb/>
made our first experiments. These demonstrations were sent to<lb/>
Mr. L.A. Howard, etymologist of the Dept. of Agriculture in Wash-<lb/>
ington and they were identified as the culex faciatus Fabr.</p>
<p>After celebrating this interview you say Reed left for Wash-<lb/>
ington and came back in October and you returned to San Jose<lb/>
Farm where you put up tents for these experiments. This I did<lb/>
not know for in the Alturas Farm of Father Zamora in the back<lb/>
of Columbia Hospital past the street car line of Marianao you set &check;<lb/>
up a camp with small houses for the Yellow Fever cases. I saw<lb/>
you here in this camp with Dr. Carrol, Lazear and the soldier,<lb/>
Dean, of the 7th Cavalry and since Lazear died in this camp I had<lb/>
thought that in no other place would a monument be more suitably<lb/>
placed---a monument to a man who sacrifized himself for science and<lb/>
<add>no!!no!P.S.H.</add><lb/>

MEDICO CIRUJANO<lb/>
-----<lb/>
GENERAL LEE NO. 19.<lb/>
TELEFONO FO-7163<lb/>
MARIANAO<lb/>
<add>Note. It was Major Reed who named his experimental camp<lb/>
after Dr. Lazear and the Americans have always used this name<lb/>
for it-<hi>JRK</hi></add><lb/>
-Page 2-<lb/>
for humanity. This I thought should be the spot called Camp<lb/>
Lazear since it was where he died and because Lazear had no<lb/>
relation whatsoever with the San Jos&eacute; Farm. All the co-<lb/>
mmissions that have come to Cuba to see the place where Lazear<lb/>
died have been taken there by me and Cuban authorities. This<lb/>
is the explanation why I and the Cuban authorities consider it<lb/>
as Camp Lazear.</p>
<p>In respect to my mistake in naming you as one of the sick in<lb/>
Quemados I'll say that I mentioned you as the resident in no. 27<lb/>
next to where I lived and didn't recall Major Edmunds. The<lb/>
important thing is that there was a case of Yellow Fever there.</p>
<p>You tell me in your letter that you have been surprized that<lb/>
Cubans have the idea that Americans intend to rob the great<lb/>
Finlay of his glory. The origin of that fear rests in the dis-<lb/>
cription on the bronze bust of the great Dr. Reed in the Capitol<lb/>
of Washington which reads: &ldquo;To Major Reed discoverer of the<lb/>
transmission of Yellow Fever by the mosquito.&rdquo; Those that have<lb/>
seen the epigraph consider it inadecuate and there lies the<lb/>
origin of the doubt in some. It is my opinion that it is im-<lb/>
possible to pretend another than Finlay to be the one who dis-<lb/>
covered and proved the transmission of Yellow Fever by the mos-<lb/>
quito since 1881. But as you say Dr. Reed with greater advan-<lb/>
tages was able to follow Finlay's technique and prove it. Here<lb/>
nobody takes away any merit from the commission, Dr. Gorgas and<lb/>
you, who with such good faith and capacity worked to benefit so<lb/>
greatly Cuba and America with this discovery.<lb/>
<add>See in closure<lb/>
of Feb 25 1941</add></p>
<p>Dr. Finlay like all discoverers had his drawbacks, the same as<lb/>
Jenner, Miguel Servet in 1853, Pasteur, Galileo and others, but<lb/>
at the end history does them justice proclaiming their glory and<lb/>
courage. I always admired Dr. Reed and Lazear, martyr of science,<lb/>
Agramonte was very young, Carrol very instructed and serious--You<lb/>
delighted me with your activity, your amiability and medical ca-<lb/>
pacity. I believe those who worked most were Dr. Gorgas and you.<lb/>
I would have liked that American intervention of 1900 to have last-<lb/>
ed 10 years more for the moral and material health of our Cuban<lb/>
people. It would have done a lot of good because of the quality<lb/>
and honorability of its members.</p>
<p>Please pardon if any word in this letter should offend you---<lb/>
Scratch it our for I only feel admiration and respect to-<lb/>
wards you. If your health is good come to my house here in<lb/>
Cuba...you have a room and are welcomed by me and my children.</p>

<p>FROM GEN. J. R. KEAN</p>
<p>-Page 3-</p>
<p>Two years ago I wrote you and told you the sad news of the<lb/>
death of my son Eddy, who was under your orders during<lb/>
the Pershing Expedition. He was of the National Guard.<lb/>
After that I wrote you another letter and still the same,--<lb/>
no answer. In Christmas I sent you my best wishes but so<lb/>
far I haven't had the pleasure of hearing from you. Do<lb/>
tell me if you received them..also a book by Dr. Dominguez<lb/>
Roldan.</p>
