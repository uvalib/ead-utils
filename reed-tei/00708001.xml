<salute>Dear Mother</salute>
</opener>
<p>We are all well &amp; doing well. L.<lb/>
is getting well, but not rapidly. nor was it to be<lb/>
expected that she would; My &ldquo;period of incubation&rdquo; will<lb/>
be out Wednesday or Thursday. &amp; I don't feel as if I were<lb/>
going to have the fever. You will know by the time you get<lb/>
this. The three men got well. one was pretty sick:</p>
<p>The excitement of this week has been my catching a<lb/>
Devil Fish. I caught one - harpooned him - a very large<lb/>
one &amp; he towed me about 6 or 7 miles. we pulling a-<lb/>
gainst him - 4 men - all the time. Sometimes he<lb/>
sunk the bow of the boat so deep that the rud-<lb/>
der - I was steering - was clear of the water &amp; I could<lb/>
not guide her, &amp; sometimes he would go ahead<lb/>
like a steamer &amp; then run off to one side<lb/>
so that, although I had one man stand by<lb/>
with an axe to cut the line if needed, yet<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00708002"/>
it was ticklish steering- when I found he was go-<lb/>
ing out to sea. I set sail &amp; carried the line astern<lb/>
&amp; when the boat pulled up by the wind, the<lb/>
harpoon pulled out. Three boats were trying.<lb/>
to help <del>up</del><add>me</add>, but could not catch up,<lb/>
we did catch a smaller one- <del>they</del><add>he ran by the</add> other boat &amp; I<lb/>
threw him (the boat) a line &amp; having 8 oarsmen on<lb/>
we so impeded his flight that the others caught up.<lb/>
This one weighed about <hi>2400</hi> to <hi>2800</hi> pounds <add>( took 8 men in a triple pulley to lift him</add> &amp; his<lb/>
mouth 2 feet 7 inches in diameter- The size of the<lb/>
escaping I don't know - but he was a whale. I could not<lb/>
get my men to go with me- I mean the two I had-<lb/>
with me-. so I took greenhorns from a vessel here: Not a man<lb/>
on the island or in any of the crews had ever seen one<lb/>
dead- <del>an</del> He is a bad looking beast: a mouth a<lb/>
bout as big as a wash tub &amp; teeth in proportion.<lb/>
The children were profoundly impressed, &amp; said<lb/>
that I must &ldquo;tell Sam &amp; Hugh.&rdquo; It is always a question with<lb/>
them &ldquo;what would Sam think<lb/>
if he was here<lb/>
now?&rdquo;<lb/>
We are suffering just now from an accident<lb/>
There was a family of rats who took such an interest in Ed-<lb/>
ward Champe that L's fears - or jealousy rather - was aroused &amp; I gave<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00708003"/>
them Arsenic. There are no walls to this place as it is<lb/>
not lathed &amp; plastered &amp; I thought we were safe, but one was<lb/>
ingenious to die in the window casing of the next<lb/>
room &amp; I don't know but he is about even with us,<lb/>
L. says she is glad that they are dead &amp; I don't like to be un-<lb/>
sympathetic, but my happiness there at isn't exuber-<lb/>
ant &amp; uncontrollable, but to a great extent modified by the<lb/>
manner or rather locality of his demise.</p>
<p>Well Quarantine is drawing to a close - 24 more<lb/>
days &amp; <hi>probably</hi> 15 more <add>to 24</add> but I think not, then I'm going<lb/>
to have some teeth fixed (pulled?) &amp; then to Fla: af-<lb/>
ter going to Chandeleur &ldquo;to see the piece of land&rdquo; like<lb/>
the man in the Bible who wanted to be excused.<lb/>
I could have doubtless done better <unclear>now</unclear> than in the spring<lb/>
but I still think is a good bargain</p>
<p>We are all intending to go to Biloxi on the <unclear>Arsene</unclear>, which<lb/>
is being painted &amp; shaped for the occasion-with all<lb/>
of her flags up &amp; have &ldquo;a party&rdquo;. The thing isn't over<lb/>
but it seems so to me.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f00708004"/>
<p>L. says the baby is very good &amp; he is: don't like to<lb/>
cry apparently: is healthy &amp; digests his food very well,<lb/>
A ships captain sent him a piece of money today &amp; when<lb/>
the children saw it in his hand. Laura cryed out, &ldquo;Oh<lb/>
Papa, look at Eddy: Do you think he brought that<lb/>
from &ldquo;<unclear>South</unclear> Beach&rdquo;, (where he is supposed to have<lb/>
been cast ashore like all the other &ldquo;finds&rdquo; on the<lb/>
island). &ldquo;Where could he have hid it&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Well good night my dear &amp; best love to all,<lb/>
we rec'd the novels: but can't say that I admire<lb/>
&ldquo;Mr. Potter of Texas&rdquo; which I read when I had a<lb/>
little (very little) Dysentry Thursday.</p>

Oct 8: Small boy has indigestion &amp; diarrhoea: but I think he will be all<lb/>
right shortly you know that isn't uncommon &amp; he has had<lb/>
none for 2 1/2 or 3 weeks: A northern on us now <del>o</del>the Ther-<lb/>
