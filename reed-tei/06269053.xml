Colonel J. R. Kean,<lb/>
Seventh and B. Streets, S.W.,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I had been hoping to hear of your interview<lb/>
with F. F. Russell. I sent to you a copy of the Sigma Zi Quart-<lb/>
erly containing Russell's address, and I hope you will note the<lb/>
several inaccuracies, some of which I pointed out to you.</p>
<p>I have just been looking over Gorgas's book,<lb/>
&ldquo;Sanitation in Panama&rdquo;. Gorgas himself says that the Americans<lb/>
arrived in Havana in December, 1898. Yellow fever was considered<lb/>
a filth disease and the military authorities concluded that this<lb/>
was the opportunity which the United States had been waiting for<lb/>
the past two hundred years. Energetic and capable army officers<lb/>
were placed at the head of various municipal departments, and by the<lb/>
middle of 1900 were perfectly organized and were accomplishing all<lb/>
that was possible. The city was cleaned as well as it was possible<lb/>
to clean it. Yellow fever patients were isolated and the health<lb/>
regulations of the Sanitary Department were thoroughly and carefully<lb/>
carried out. In spite of this yellow fever had been steadily growing<lb/>
worse every since the Americans had taken possession of the city, and<lb/>
in 1900 there were a greater number of cases than there had been for<lb/>
several years. The cleanest and best kept portions of the city were<lb/>
the worst sufferers <add>from</add> yellow fever, and the Cubans twitted the Ameri-<lb/>
cans over the uselessness of their work, claiming that they had made<lb/>
things worse instead of better. It is curious in view of the abundant<lb/>
testimony there is on this subject that Dr. Russell should have made<lb/>

such blunders, and further I consider it inexcusable.</p>
<p>With much respect, I am,</p>
