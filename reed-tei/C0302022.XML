<salute>Dear Doctor Connor:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Today I sent the following telegram addressed to<lb/>
you at Tampico, Veracruz and Mexico City:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspected case of yellow fever presented itself<lb/>
today. Autopsy by Dr. Galindo. Section of liver<lb/>
on way to Department. Am writing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The deceased Luis Villalobos Corona left Manzanillo<lb/>
for Colima on August 13, 1923, in apparent good health. He<lb/>
had been employed in Manzanillo as a mechanic on a Government<lb/>
launch.</p>
<p>He was seen yesterday about 3 P.M. by Doctor Ciro<lb/>
Hurtado of this city who found him in a moribund condition with<lb/>
hemmorahges from the mouth and rectum. Death ensued the same<lb/>
night and today Doctor Hurtado gave a Certificate of yellow<lb/>
fever.</p>
<p>Knowledge of these occurences were conveyed to this<lb/>
office by a Reportor of the &ldquo;Informador&rdquo;, a Newspaper published<lb/>
in Guadalajara, who came here looking for more detailed informa-<lb/>
tion.</p>
<p>I immediately saw this Doctor who confirmed the rumor<lb/>
stating that he was not positive that it was yellow fever, but<lb/>
that the bloody stools and vomitus had caused him to make that<lb/>
diagnosis.</p>
<pb n="2" id="fC0302023"/>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Thereupon I went in search of Doctor Galindo Medico<lb/>
Delegado in this city and found that he had received no advise<lb/>
of the matter.</p>
<p>We instantly proceeded to the Cemetery arriving just<lb/>
as the body was being lowered into the grave. A partial autopsy<lb/>
was performed and a section of Liver removed, which specimen has<lb/>
been sent to the Department preserved in ten per cent Formalin<lb/>
solution.</p>
<p>The body was viewed by us at exactly one thirty P.M.<lb/>
or twelve to fifteen hours after death had occured. There was<lb/>
an entire absence of yellowness, the nasal passages were com-<lb/>
pletely clogged by a profuse amount of bright red blood, the<lb/>
abdomen being enormously distended the intestines were pricked<lb/>
as they presented themselves in the incision and I was able to<lb/>
note a quite extensive amount of altered blood, perfectly black,<lb/>
the liver was small and hard and upon cross-section it appeared<lb/>
cirrhotic.</p>
<p>I have asked Doctor Hurtado to write me a letter giving<lb/>
me his impressions of what he saw when he visited the deceased.<lb/>
When I possess this information copies will be sent to you and to<lb/>
the Departmento.</p>
<p>The deceased met his death at 451 Calle Belisario Dom-<lb/>
inguez which is located two blocks from the R&sol;R Station.</p>
<p>The block in which he lived and died was personally<lb/>
inspected this evening. It is composed of twelve houses and no<lb/>
Mosquito breeding was found.</p>
<pb n="3" id="fC0302024"/>
<p>3.</p>
<p>While the personnel has not been increased every-<lb/>
thing possible is being done to increase anti-larvae activity<lb/>
and especially in the district immediately surrounding the<lb/>
suspected residence.</p>
<p>As soon as I may I shall proceed to Munzanillo as<lb/>
there are apparently well founded rumors that this man was a<lb/>
pronounced alcoholic and I am anxious to confirm them.</p>
<p>Doctor Galindo informed me that he did not consider<lb/>
the case as one of yellow fever.</p>

<salute>Very truly,</salute>

Departamento. You no doubt have now seen original.<lb/>
