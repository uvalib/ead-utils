<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This is a formal invitation from the University of Havana for you<lb/>
and your wife to participate in the International Congress on Nutrition and<lb/>
Metabolism, which will meet between the 20th and the 26th of January in<lb/>
Havana, Cuba.</p>
<p>The Cubans have loved you for a long time. They like your warm<lb/>
personality and they like your interest in Carlos Finlay. Most American<lb/>
doctors they don't like. Since I have been spending much of my time there<lb/>
during the past eight years, I have gotten to know them well and, for that<lb/>
reason, they asked me to inquire of you if you will accept their invitation.<lb/>
They know that you are invited all over the world and they feel very humble<lb/>
about asking you to come.</p>
<p>They <hi>will take care of your and your wife's room at the Hotel<lb/>
Nacional, and I am</hi> sure that if the Mayo Clinic should desire it, they<lb/>
would be glad to take care of your travel expenses to and from. They did<lb/>
not say anything about that to me but they badly want you. They want you<lb/>
to represent the Mayo Clinic. You are their friend and, at the same time,<lb/>
you epitomize much that is great about the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>The Congress itself, I think, will be the most outstanding thing<lb/>
in nutrition and metabolism that I have ever heard about. They expect to<lb/>
have Bill Murphy and he has told me unofficially that he expects to go.<lb/>
Among others expected are Bob Williams, who, as you know, synthesized vitamin<lb/>
B1; Glen King, who isolated vitamin C; Henry Sebrell, Director of the National<lb/>
Institute of Health; Elvehjem, who is the dean of the graduate school at<lb/>
Wisconsin and who is representing the University of Wisconsin; and C. P.<lb/>
Loranz, who is General Manager of the Southern Medical Association and who<lb/>
is representing it. They expect the President of the A.M.A. to be there,<lb/>
though we have not yet asked him to make a final decision. There will be<lb/>
a lot of other terribly important people both on the program and as observers.<lb/>
You and I will have to carry most of the work about metabolism and, of course,<lb/>
that means you. In selecting the group, they had that in mind.</p>
<p>Not knowing how the Mayo Clinic does things exactly, I wonder if<lb/>
you have a trip committee or group that passes on these invitations. If so,<lb/>
will you tell them that this is a formal invitation, which will be followed<lb/>
by the University of Havana's really formal invitation when they are appraised<lb/>

of the fact that you will consider coming. You know how delicate they are<lb/>
about embarrassing anybody -- hence, their reason for asking me to ascertain<lb/>
this bit of information. If I had to say, I feel that the Cubans consider<lb/>
you more essential than anyone else on the program.</p>
<p>I am leaving for Havana about the 11th or 12th of this month. If<lb/>
it is convenient, you might send a wire to me in Birmingham, appraising me<lb/>
what the score might be.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
