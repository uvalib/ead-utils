<salute>Dear Ma:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I don't know if I wrote Easter Sun-<lb/>
day or no. Did I? I left Monday for Biloxi &amp;<lb/>
thence up the Country per rail to get a<lb/>
load of Lumber - to Pearl River &amp; that County<lb/>
which I did at $9.00 per m at the mill<lb/>
instead of $14.50 as I was advised. In<lb/>
the $16 m, which I bought, it comes to<lb/>
a good deal, Came home Thursday<lb/>
&amp; hope I have done with Biloxi, for this<lb/>
season. There is still an abundance to do<lb/>
here-, as the purchase of 16000 f't of lumber testifies<lb/>
but after about 10 days I <hi>think</hi> I see<lb/>

my way clear to quiet, steady work - say<lb/>
15 days. Our life - all things considered, is<lb/>
far less unpleasant than S.I. &amp; indeed is not<lb/>
unpleasant at all. There is much to see. Today,<lb/>
to let L. sleep, I moved the children about<lb/>
a mile down the Island &amp; saw more<lb/>
kinds of new birds than I ever saw <add>in the same time</add><lb/>
9 marsh-hens (Poules d' Eau) in one myrtle<lb/>
bush: &amp; 10 or 15, gros- bec's, (i.e. Herons). They are<lb/>
good, but have nests now: No end - probably<lb/>
5000, small birds <add>some beautiful ones &amp; a long <hi>row of Egrets</hi></add>, not in flocks but every<lb/>
where. It is any thing but dull here. Fishing<lb/>
is not going to be good, save on the outerbeach &amp; I<lb/>
am afraid of sharks there though I've seen none. <lb/>
Poor little Ned got a long <hi>button hook</hi> hung in<lb/>
his throat last night &amp; broke up the family. It<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00710003"/>
did no real injury, but hurt him &amp; might have<lb/>
done much. I think it was caught behind<lb/>
the palate (on the way to the nose). I was here<lb/>
providentially &amp; got it out after some little<lb/>
time. Henry came to his mother, &ldquo;Mamma don't you<lb/>
cry, sister asked God to take that hook out &amp;<lb/>
make him all right. Don't you mind now&rdquo;. She<lb/>
is inclined to impose on him, but sister is a<lb/>
great standby to Henry. Both of them are<lb/>
fond of the baby now, who is a very good<lb/>
child, the best I've been interested in, &amp; one<lb/>
of the healthiest. Plays with himself &amp; don't<lb/>
require to be be amused,</p>
<p>Am afraid that I will have a busy summer<lb/>
at least until August, as the fever is very<lb/>
bad on the Brazilian Coast- The worst ever known<lb/>

in Rio Janeiro. It is apt however to stop<lb/>
there - or at least greatly lessen in May &amp; June<lb/>
(Nov &amp; Dec. to them). Fortunately, the &ldquo;boom &rdquo; of the<lb/>
Rio Plata cities, Montevideo &amp; Buenos Ayres,<lb/>
takes most of our Rio trade &amp; we have fewer<lb/>
Rio repets than formerly.However I'll get<lb/>
my share of work &amp; I fear of sickness,</p>
<p>One thing here better than S. I. is a smooth, hard<lb/>
&amp; flat beach, we had none there; The view is proba-<lb/>
bly not so pretty as from <hi>one</hi> place there; the house<lb/>
is infinitely preferable; as is the water for boating<lb/>
Although the bottom is bad (mud,) &amp; not good<lb/>
for bathing, still as we can have a bath house<lb/>
on the water, &amp; I can go to the sand beach, that<lb/>
makes no difference. So far as we have gone, every<lb/>
thing taken together this place is very much pref<lb/>
erable to S. I. L. likes it better, &amp; so do the children.<lb/>
This is a short letter, but it is to tell you that we are all<lb/>
well (H. is not quite well) &amp; more comfortable<lb/>
than we have been since we left <unclear>N. O to</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00710005"/>
The children say will you please<lb/>
send them a young &ldquo;Grindly Gog&rdquo;<lb/>
They had rather <hi>not</hi> have a big one<lb/>
because he might not know he<lb/>
was tame. We have an attic<lb/>
without floor or windows where<lb/>
they propose to keep him. They<lb/>
think he will be very useful to<lb/>
scare Maud &amp; Nelly when they<lb/>
won't go home<lb/>
think as comfortable as we were there, &amp; with less<lb/>
worries,</p>
<p>Love to all</p>
