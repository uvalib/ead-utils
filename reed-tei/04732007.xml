<p><add><unclear>Let to Dr. Le May</unclear></add></p>
<p><del>so here is my reply to what you asked:</del></p>
<p>The impression the play Yellow Jack, by Sidney Howard, was if<lb/>
as I were witnessing a caricarture: people bearing familiar<lb/>
names and others with strange names going through actions of<lb/>
which I seemed to be slightly familiar, yet I was unable to<lb/>
connect it with any people I had known in Cuba, where most of<lb/>
the events in the play were supposed to have transpired.</p>
<p>When I heard that it was to be presented on T.V. I procured a<lb/>
book of the play and read it carefully. In it are the fundda-<lb/>
mentals of the scientific facts of the Cuban and African ex-<lb/>
periments, but to term such a drama &ldquo;historical&rdquo; is scarcely<lb/>
justified.</p>
<p>Of course, Sidney Howard as a playwright had to make it inter-<lb/>
esting and amusing to an audience, but to do so by twisting<lb/>
the characters and convictions of real men out of all semblance<lb/>
to themselves was an outrage.</p>
<p>I never met Moran, (the sole volunteer I did not know personally)<lb/>
but I feel sure that he was never like the O'Hara of the drama<lb/>
any more than Kissinger, Jernejan and Folk resembled the Brin-<lb/>
kerhof, McClelland and Burch depicted in the play.</p>
<p>Why take Dean and have him talk of veneral disease, when, as a<lb/>
calvaryman, being kicked on the knee by a horse, which as the<lb/>
truth would have sufficed.</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>The manner of talk of these men is not only a reflection on the<lb/>
men of the Hospital Corps, but on all enlisted men of the Army.<lb/>
He puts them in the class of Cockney English soldiers made<lb/>
famous by Rudyard Kipling. But Sidney Howard is no Kipling, so<lb/>
he twists the real facts around just to make these preposterous<lb/>
and would-be funny conversations possible.</p>
<p>As Howard, himself, wrote Gust Lambert, (the real nurse) &ldquo;He had<lb/>
to make the nurse a female, as an audience would not like an<lb/>
all-man play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Gorgas had a female nurse in the virus experiments in<lb/>
Havana, Cuba, and they lost 4 out of 10 cases. If Dr. Ames or<lb/>
Lambert alone had been there they would have lost none. If it<lb/>
had not been for Lambert, with his great, but gentle strength<lb/>
and psychology, crude though it was, there would have been, per-<lb/>
haps no successful finish to an experiment for Howard to make<lb/>
a play about.</p>
<p>But I suppose it all seems fine to the audience. Sidney Howard<lb/>
is one of those playwrights who must have humor even in tragedy.<lb/>
But he wants too much comedy, (not humor) at the expense of <del>of</del><lb/>
sober, diligent, brave men who were not humorous at all. It was<lb/>
deliberate, for he states in his foreword: &ldquo;That it may well give<lb/>
offence to those characters in the play who are still alive. -<lb/>
. . and I did not attempt to protray them as they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great playwright could have made use of the men and material<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04732008"/>
(3)<lb/>
in these experiments and produced a noble and interesting<lb/>
drama without attempting to make buffons out of courageous men.<lb/>
But, unfortunately, Mr. Howard is not a great playwright, so<lb/>
he failed in producing an &ldquo;Historical Drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, that is my humble opinion of the play that you asked for.<lb/>
I, of course, <add>k</add>no<add>w</add> nothing of the African Experiments except what<lb/>
I have read in the Rockeffeller Foundation bullitins, but I<lb/>
guess the characters were as twisted as much as in the Cuban<lb/>
affair.</p>
