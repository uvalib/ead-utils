<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Things happen strangely. I was writing your name on the wrapping of<lb/>
the Watson book in returning it to you, when your letter was brought in<lb/>
<del>yhis morning</del><lb/>
this morning. It has gone forward to you--registered.</p>
<p>Lucky Louis! Several months ago, my name was suggested to the I.H.B.<lb/>
in connection with their proposed work in that country. I told Mr. Rose<lb/>
that I was very much interested. As for the Service, however, I don't<lb/>
believe I will ever get a chance to do anything but work-- handicapped<lb/>
by not being a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; <unclear>l l</unclear>. I should like to have gone on this detail,<lb/>
but am particularly pleased that Louis was the one selected.</p>
<p>Yes; I called on Henry when in Birmingham about a month ago. I had<lb/>
met him a year ago and found him a delightful fellow--just as I had<lb/>
quite naturally expected to find him. I shall see him again soon<lb/>
and want to avail myself of your good offer about the volume of P. of M.<lb/>
<del>of</del><lb/>
of T.</p>
<p>I thank you very much for the use of the Watson's so long. If the<lb/>
Service would do like other countries and send its men out oftener to<lb/>
see what the rest of the world is doing, we'd get somewhere surer, and<lb/>
perhaps sometime would detail men according to their fitness, rather than<lb/>
from rank, etc. If a man knows work, or if he is intelligently interseted<lb/>
enough to learn it, that's what he should be assigned to.</p>
<p>I am leaving in a few minutes for Dale county, and among other things<lb/>

I expect to get by blood examinations somewhat of a check on the efficacy<lb/>
of quinine use around a bad pond-- the Newton pond, where about seventy<lb/>
per cent of the people had malaria last year. They were given the standard<lb/>
treatment last Fall. All cases now should be of last years infection, or<lb/>
previous infections. While at the dam a short time ago, out of <del>three</del><lb/>
five or six men standing aroun<add>d</add>. I got blood from three. All were positive,<lb/>
two carried gametocytes and one had both AE and Ter. This case had <hi>AE rings,<lb/>
schizonts, crescents and tertian gametocytes</hi>. <hi>And</hi> he is supposed to have had<lb/>
standard treatment. This is a sample, but I hope it does not hold out for<lb/>
the rest of the population!</p>
