<p>Nogueira sends Hench photographs of Building No. 1. The dedication of Camp Lazear will be on December 3, 1952, and he is going to send out the invitations soon. Nogueira wants Hench to attend the Science Academy Session following the dedication, which will be dedicated solely to the work of the Yellow Fever Commission, and for which he will be the principal speaker. He promises to save some of the original wood from Building No. 1 for Hench.</p>

<salute>Dear Philip:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Embracing that our good friend Mr Hess was going to<lb/>
New York, I gave him an <unclear>envelope</unclear> with photos of the Camp, as well<lb/>
as, perpendicular air views I had on hand, for you to send them by<lb/>
air mail at Rochester, The tangencial views, have not been able to<lb/>
get yet why through the bad storm overhear but I hope to have them<lb/>
inside a few days.- Enclosed other photos stayed here.</p>
<p>On the other hand I am painting the little house which is throu<add>gh</add><lb/>
and soon I will take some photos to send you<unclear></unclear> right away. The park<lb/>
is still in construction, although the rain has kept back some of<lb/>
the work. Maybe you read about the storm we had 24th last month;<lb/>
but it crossed on the middle of the country.</p>
<p>I am sending the invitations to the persons that you named,<lb/>
after I will send you the program 3er December complete, to each<lb/>
one; but from now I inform you, the Camp act will be at 10.00 A.M.<lb/>
Same day you have a turn on the program 8 to 10 minutes. I pray<lb/>
Philip you send me that speech some days before to be able to trans-<lb/>
late it to spanish, to have time to send to the newspaper copies<lb/>
to come out that very evening and at the same time in the next day<lb/>
papers. I will get your room on National Hotel for 2nd and 3erd,<lb/>
but I would like to know if you are along or with Mary; and I hope<lb/>
that you will stay here till 4th morning, to attend the Science Aca<lb/>
demy Session on the 3rd night, which I will be the principal speker<lb/>
dedicating almost the whole to the Yellow Fever Commission. (Don-t<lb/>
forget your Condecoration Finlay Medals when you coming).-</p>
<p>Beside that very night the Condecorations will be given to the<lb/>
persons appointed with Finlay Order during this year. To that effect<lb/>
I have noted the names you send me, and wish to inform you, that<lb/>
Order, can be given to ev<add>e</add>ry one, who have done something for the<lb/>
good of humanity, if not on Public Health or other branch of Medi-<lb/>
cine. What the Council agrees, I will inform you later.- I have<lb/>
plenty wood left from the Caseta and will have them prepared for<lb/>
you and every one, who wishes to keep something of the same, like<lb/>
souvenir.</p>
<p>Philip can I get through you, some actual photos of Truby, Han-<lb/>
berry, Cooke and Lambert?.- Philip, write me often, on relation w<lb/>
with all this, why I want the act to be a true memory of those bra-<lb/>
ve men, who on this <unclear>Marianao</unclear> City wrote, the most wonderful page of<lb/>
human love.</p>
<p>Write early and till next week:</p>
<closer>

NOTE.- Can you send inmediatly<lb/>
the Lambert adress?<lb/>
