Dr. H. R. Carter,<lb/>
Marine, Hospital,<lb/>
Baltimore, Md.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am just back from South Carolina where I have<lb/>
conferred with my associates in regard to the mosquito cases,<lb/>
and among other things we considered was the question of the<lb/>
attendance of our witnesses,- particularly the witnesses who<lb/>
are non-residents of the State of South Carolina. The cases<lb/>
will stand for trial at the Common Pleas Court, which begins<lb/>
on the 4th Monday in March next, and of course it may be, and<lb/>
probably will be, that the cases will not actually be begun<lb/>
on that date, but at some later date during that term. How-<lb/>
ever, we will have to be ready so far as we know now on that<lb/>
date.</p>
<p>We do not desire to take depositions of witnesses<lb/>
unless it is going to be impossible to have the witnesses per-<lb/>
sonally present. It may be, however, that we will have to<lb/>
take depositions as a matter of precaution, although we expect<lb/>
and hope to have the witnesses personally present also.</p>
<p>I herewith enclose you a subpoena writ summoning you<lb/>
to appear as a witness on behalf of The Colleton Cypress Company<lb/>
ALL ORDERS AND CONTRACTS ARE TAKEN SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE HOME OFFICE, AND ARE CONDITIONAL UPON STRIKES, FIRE, FLOODS, <hi>INABILITY TO<lb/>
SECURE CARS</hi>, AND OTHER CAUSES BEYOND OUR CONTROL. ALL QUOTATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO PRIOR SALE.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00803082"/>
H.R.C.- 2.<lb/>
at the Court beginning on the 4th Monday in March next, and also<lb/>
hand you herewith a subpoena. On the back of the subpoena<lb/>
writ is a place for acceptance of service and I will thank you<lb/>
to date that acceptance and sign your name and return to me and<lb/>
oblige. The subpoena herewith sent you is to be retained<lb/>
by you as your authority for appearing as a witness.</p>
<p>Please advise me if you expect to be able to personally<lb/>
attend the Court on the 4th Monday in March next, and if not is<lb/>
there any possibility that you will be outside of the United States?<lb/>
I ask this question because if we have your acceptance of service<lb/>
as a witness and you are ill or for any other unavoidable reason<lb/>
not in attendance upon the Court, we would have pretty good grounds<lb/>
for continuing the cases until some time when you could attend,-<lb/>
that is if you were at the time in the United States. Such would<lb/>
not be the case if you were outside of the jurisdiction of the<lb/>
United States.</p>
<p>I enclose self-addressed envelope for the return of<lb/>
the subpoena writ.</p>
<p>With kindest regards, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
