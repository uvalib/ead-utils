<p>Kean believes that the fever charts mentioned by Hench were probably copies of the originals. He doesn't remember much about his own illness with yellow fever except the headache and backache.</p>

answered from Ft. Custer 8/16/42<lb/>

<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> gave me<lb/>
great pleasure and I was much<lb/>
interested in the inclosures and thank<lb/>
you for sending them- It was very<lb/>
clever of you to think of writing to<lb/>
Mrs. Ames about them and very<lb/>
decent of her to let you have them.<lb/>
I would think that the fever charts<lb/>
of Dr. Ames and myself were copies<lb/>
made, perhaps in the S. G. O., evidently<lb/>
by the same clerical hand- As you say<lb/>
original bedside charts would be never<lb/>
so neat, well written and clean-</p>
<p>The notes of my case were evidently<lb/>
made by the attendant on duty, who<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06310126"/>
2<lb/>
was probably Lambert, but I am<lb/>
sorry to say that I do not remember<lb/>
very clearly anything that happened<lb/>
during my illness except the headache<lb/>
and the backache, and the wonderful<lb/>
refreshment of the champagne after<lb/>
four days of water only- The temp.<lb/>
&amp; pulse do not look like those of a<lb/>
very sick man &amp; the only serious symp-<lb/>
tom I had was hemorrhage from<lb/>
the gums which caused Stark to<lb/>
give a bad prognosis- I do not know<lb/>
if there is any record of the examinations<lb/>
of the urine, which is of course very<lb/>
important in yellow fever- My<lb/>
impression is that there was very<lb/>
little albumen, tho., in the first five<lb/>
days, the amount of urine seems<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06310127"/>
3<lb/>
to have been rather deficient, being<lb/>
a total of 2495 c. c. to a fluid intake<lb/>
of 4743 c c - a daily average of<lb/>
about a pint of urine to an intake of<lb/>
a quart of fluid- If the charts of the<lb/>
experimental cases at Camp Lazear<lb/>
are as fairly made out as mine &amp;<lb/>
Ames's are (which are evidently made<lb/>
by the same person) I would say they<lb/>
were copies- Are they in the same<lb/>
hand as mine &amp; Ames'<hi>?</hi></p>
<p>Isn't it curious that Ames makes his<lb/>
<hi>a</hi> s just like his <hi>o</hi> s-</p>
<p>I think that Ames's comment on the<lb/>
back of Dean's Chart about &ldquo;<hi>his name<lb/>
and the manner of taking poison has<lb/>
never been reported</hi>&rdquo; refers to the<lb/>
circumstances of his inoculation- Ames<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06310128"/>
4<lb/>
liked to use odd expressions. Dean was<lb/>
a normal extrovert and taking poison<lb/>
in the literal sense would never have<lb/>
occurred to him-</p>
<p>I do not know, or do not recall having<lb/>
met either Lt. Col. Richman or Col<lb/>
Oatman at Fort Custer or Col. Floyd<lb/>
Hunter at Camp Carson, but I<lb/>
have casually met so many of the<lb/>
Med. Corps in the days gone by<lb/>
that I am never sure- I have<lb/>
not Gen. Ireland's or your memory<lb/>
for names and faces you know-<lb/>
I hope you will send me a note<lb/>
or a postal when you get to your<lb/>
new station at Camp Carson- It<lb/>
is always a pleasure to hear from<lb/>
you- I have returned Ames's indorsement<lb/>
to your office at Rochester for file, as<lb/>
I feel sure you do not want to be carrying it around with you.<lb/>
In your new military life you do not want any <hi>impedimenta</hi><lb/>
which you do not need for military purposes.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours</salute>
