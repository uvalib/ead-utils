<salute>Miss Lawrence,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Believe me,<lb/>
it is a genuine pleasure<lb/>
to lay aside the dusty<lb/>
book over whose uninter-<lb/>
esting pages I have been<lb/>
bending all the day long,<lb/>
and to take up my pen for<lb/>
a few moments. If I appear<lb/>
amazingly stupid, as I pro-<lb/>
ceed, please remember that<lb/>
my mind has been racked,<lb/>
during the past day or two,<lb/>
with the &ldquo;atomic theory&rdquo; and<lb/>
the &ldquo;law of equivalents;&rdquo; so<lb/>
that, peradventure whatsoever<lb/>
I shall send, will not con-<lb/>
tain an atom of news or<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01606002"/>
be equivalent to your loss of<lb/>
time in reading it.</p>
<p>From early morning till far<lb/>
into the hours of night I must<lb/>
needs be plodding along through<lb/>
dry details and charging my<lb/>
memory with a thousand dif-<lb/>
ferent matters which may<lb/>
possibly prove useful to<lb/>
me in the coming ordeal.<lb/>
The truth is, I was not aware<lb/>
of how much I had forgot-<lb/>
ten and in how many places<lb/>
the rust had accumulated,<lb/>
till I began a careful re-<lb/>
view. The more I read, the<lb/>
greater the task looms up be-<lb/>
fore me, <del>s</del>till I stand appalled<lb/>
at the work that must be done,<lb/>
and almost think that all<lb/>
I ever knew has forsaken<lb/>
me. But the one thing I will<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01606003"/>
not permit to forsake me is my<lb/>
courage, and if effort will avail<lb/>
anything, it shall not fail me<lb/>
in this case. I went over to<lb/>
New York, a few days ago, and<lb/>
had a long talk with the<lb/>
Recorder of the Examining Board.<lb/>
To my utter astonishment, he<lb/>
informed me that candidates<lb/>
must stand an examination<lb/>
on Latin, Greek, Mathematics<lb/>
&amp; History, in addition to med-<lb/>
ical subjects. Horror of hor-<lb/>
rors! Imagine me conjugating<lb/>
an irregular Greek verb, or<lb/>
telling what x + y equals, or<lb/>
when Rome was founded,<lb/>
or the battle of Marathon<lb/>
<add><del>was</del></add> fought- why the thing is impos-<lb/>
sible- I shall utterly fail.<lb/>
Add to this that each ap-<lb/>
plicant is examined five<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01606004"/>
hours, each day, during six<lb/>
successive days-- thirty hours<lb/>
questioning-- and to cap the<lb/>
climax, there are more than<lb/>
five hundred applicants for<lb/>
less than thirty vacancies!<lb/>
The very thought of it makes<lb/>
me dizzy. Think of my condi-<lb/>
tion and pity me; for I need<lb/>
all the sympathy of all my<lb/>
friends.</p>
<p>Thus, you perceive, my<lb/>
time has been spent in quite<lb/>
a different way from that<lb/>
you described. No recreation,<lb/>
no jollity, no gliding &ldquo;softly<lb/>
o'er the rippling waters,&rdquo; no<lb/>
listening to &ldquo;wandering strains<lb/>
of melody.&rdquo; Your moon-light<lb/>
excursion down the Meherrin<lb/>
must have been quite roman-<lb/>
tic. It is enough for me to<lb/>
know that it was a &ldquo;feast<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01606005"/>
of reason.&rdquo; At such a time I<lb/>
ask nothing better than to meet<lb/>
with some friend. (of course,<lb/>
I mean a lady-friend). Yes, some<lb/>
bright, sensible <hi>woman</hi> whose<lb/>
conversation is both agreeable<lb/>
and entertaining, and who<lb/>
will kindly permit a reward<lb/>
to be interpolated, now and then.<lb/>
How fast the hours speed their<lb/>
flight to us unconscious. Whol-<lb/>
ly absorbed <del>with</del><add>in</add> the Present,<lb/>
we forget the annoyances of<lb/>
the Past and care not for<lb/>
the revelations of the Future.<lb/>
In after days, we look back<lb/>
with unallayed delight, and<lb/>
remember such occassions as<lb/>
the oases in life's desert. But if,<lb/>
per contra, one cannot sit<lb/>
quietly and chat a friend, but<lb/>
is expected to fly here and<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01606006"/>
there, like a bee in Spring-time,<lb/>
and gather pleasure from the<lb/>
conversation of a dozen; how<lb/>
unfortunate is the lot of such<lb/>
an one! For me the result<lb/>
would be a cup of bitters.<lb/>
And, just here, an idea occurs<lb/>
to me which, with your permis-<lb/>
sion, I will pursue briefly.<lb/>
I sometimes think that I am<lb/>
a peculiar mortal. Perhaps I<lb/>
am invited to be present at a<lb/>
party, composed of ladies and<lb/>
gentlemen, assembled for the pur-<lb/>
pose of spending an evening in<lb/>
pleasant social intercourse.<lb/>
I go with the determination to<lb/>
act my part as well as I can,<lb/>
with no malice in my heart<lb/>
toward any living soul. I arrive<lb/>
and am <del>a</del> ushered into a<lb/>
brilliantly lighted parlor<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01606007"/>
where are seated a dozen or<lb/>
more prettily dressed young<lb/>
ladies and as many starchy<lb/>
looking young gentlemen; the<lb/>
<hi>buds</hi> of modern society.<lb/>
Every one seems in the best of<lb/>
humor, and I, too, enter into the<lb/>
mirth of the occassion. As the<lb/>
conversation quickly flies from<lb/>
one topic to another, listen for<lb/>
a moment. Yon fair one is going<lb/>
into ecstasy over the last Sara-<lb/>
toga Boat Race, and that<lb/>
flashily-dressed young gen-<lb/>
tleman is expatiating with all<lb/>
his powers of eloquence about<lb/>
the grandeur of some recent<lb/>
Ball. Perchance there is a lull<lb/>
in the conversation, when forth-<lb/>
with a damsel to the piano<lb/>
hies and, for the edification<lb/>
of all, drums away at an operatic<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01606008"/>
air with all her might. Should<lb/>
any one be so forgetful as<lb/>
to suggest a topic of interest,<lb/>
he soon finds himself without<lb/>
any audience. They say you are<lb/>
too <hi>serious</hi>. And thus the hours<lb/>
pass, till finally the time of<lb/>
departure arrives, when expres-<lb/>
sing oursel<del>f</del>ves as <del>being</del> pleased,<lb/>
beyond measure, with <add>the</add> evening's<lb/>
entertainment, &amp; bidding many<lb/>
adieus, we depart. I loiter home<lb/>
slowly, and muse by the way-<lb/>
side. I wonder, how in the name<lb/>
of all that is sensible, can<lb/>
people be entertained with<lb/>
such silly frivolous conver-<lb/>
sation! Can mortal man or<lb/>
woman grow wiser by listening<lb/>
to such shallow, superficial<lb/>
nothingness! Is there no germ<lb/>
of advancement implanted<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01606009"/>
in the bosoms of such creatures?<lb/>
Is there no longing desire to<lb/>
add to their store of information?<lb/>
If so, why are they satisfied with<lb/>
babbling such a lot of foolish-<lb/>
ness! Is it possible that exter-<lb/>
nal realities merely give rise<lb/>
in them to a <hi>sensation</hi>, and this<lb/>
is converted into so many move-<lb/>
ments of the tongue, without<lb/>
any <hi>thought</hi> being involved in<lb/>
the process from beginning to<lb/>
end! Verily, it so seemeth! Thus<lb/>
musing, I reach my door. The<lb/>
thought occurs to me that I may<lb/>
be too unappreciative and I<lb/>
would gladly thus construe<lb/>
it. Yet, I cannot hide my ut-<lb/>
ter disappointment in having<lb/>
thrown away another evening.<lb/>
I feel that, rather than un-<lb/>
dergo a repetition of the same,<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01606010"/>
I would prefer that &ldquo;a mill-stone<lb/>
be hanged about my neck<lb/>
and that I be drowned in<lb/>
the depths of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And since I have hung this<lb/>
&ldquo;mill-stone&rdquo; about my neck, I<lb/>
begin to feel the <hi>weight</hi> of it.<lb/>
Under these circumstances, you<lb/>
could not expect me to continue<lb/>
my letter. You may regret that<lb/>
I did not find my burden sooner.<lb/>
Regarding this latter conclusion<lb/>
as the most probable, I <hi>will</hi><lb/>
stop, but not before begging<lb/>
that you will excuse this<lb/>
hastily and miserably written<lb/>
letter, and</p>
<closer>
<salute>believe me, as ever,<lb/>
with much respect,</salute>
<signed>Walter Reed</signed>
