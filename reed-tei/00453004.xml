Mrs. Mable H. Lazear,<lb/>
#2907 Dwight Way,<lb/>
Berkeley, California.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mable;-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I acknowledge receipt of yours of the 21st., en-<lb/>
closing letter of the Trust Company, dated August 30, 1921,<lb/>
which I herewith return as requested.</p>
<p>Under the laws of Pennsylvania, prevailing at the<lb/>
time of Jesse's death, his surviving children inherited his<lb/>
real estate absolutely subject to the widow's dower, which is<lb/>
one-third of the real estate, for life, and in a case like this,<lb/>
where the property has been sold, the one-third of the net pro-<lb/>
ceeds of the real estate is held in trust during the life of the<lb/>
widow, and she is entitled to receive the entire income on this<lb/>
one-third. At her death, the corpus or principal yielding this<lb/>
income will pass to her children, free of the dower. This is<lb/>
simply an old common law of England, and the law of most States<lb/>
where there is intestacy. Of late years, there has been a ten-<lb/>
dency to modify this, and give the wife an immediate interest in<lb/>
his real estate, in lieu of dower.</p>
<p>I called up Mr. Burguin, and he has confirmed my<lb/>
idea on the subject that the amount held by the Trust Company<lb/>
is one-third of the net proceeds of the sale of the Frankstown<lb/>
Avenue property to Ludebuhl. I do not consider it material to<lb/>
ascertain the exact amount being held, but at a guess. I think it<lb/>
was $8000 or $9000, and my recollection is that it is about one-<lb/>
third of the net proceeds of the sale, after the payment of Jesse's<lb/>
obligations, which, as I recall it, were a judgment note of $6000.<lb/>
given to father in settlement of his account, and also a mortgage<lb/>
of $6000, which was borrowed on the property at the time the build-<lb/>
ing was erected thereon. You will find among Jesse's papers, a<lb/>
complete accounting in the matter, and I recall, at the time of his<lb/>
death or sale, you asked for an explanation of his indebtedness,<lb/>
which were evidenced by the mortgage and the judgment.</p>
<p>You will therefore understand that during your life,<lb/>
you are entitled to the income on this sum so held, and after your<lb/>
death, the children will receive the principal, and of course the<lb/>
Trust Company cannot advance you any of the principal, unless the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00453005"/>
Mrs. Mable H. Lazear (2).<lb/>
children assign a portion of this sum to you, and direct it to be<lb/>
paid immediately. I think this could be worked out with the ap-<lb/>
proval of the court.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear from you, and with regard to the<lb/>
children. I attended an audit in court on Wednesday by which Mar-<lb/>
garet received. I think, about $12,000., being her share with some<lb/>
accumulations on the proceeds of the sale above mentioned. I should<lb/>
answer your interrogatory that the same situation applies to the<lb/>
Denniston Avenue property, one-third of the net rents of which you<lb/>
are entitled to receive, and if the property were sold, you would<lb/>
receive one-third of the interest realized from the fund.</p>
<p>My own idea is that this property should be sold if<lb/>
it can be sold advantageously, for the reason that the building<lb/>
must be very old and is only frame. I would suggest that you have<lb/>
the children write, expressing their wish to have the property dis-<lb/>
posed of, if it can be done advantageously. It is however, well<lb/>
located, and I don't think will depreciate in price very much.</p>
<p>My son John is working diligently with the Duquesne<lb/>
Steel Works, and Jane is living with her husband at Norfolk, Navy<lb/>
Yard. They have two very attractive children - a little girl about<lb/>
five, and a boy about two and one-half.</p>
<p>I look back with great pleasure on your hospitality, and<lb/>
your artistic surroundings at Santa Barbara, I am sure I saw more<lb/>
attractive houses there than in any other one location I have ever<lb/>
visited.</p>
<p>With love to Margaret,</p>
