<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of 8th was here when I returned<lb/>
from a two day trip to Montgomery.</p>
<p>I am greatly interested in your letter to Dr. F.,<lb/>
and thank you very much for the details <del><unclear>next</unclear></del><add>concerning</add><lb/>
<del><unclear>expansions</unclear></del> N. C. projects. I don't know what Dr. F.<lb/>
will do about it. All I can say on this point is,<lb/>
I hope his action will be based upon your advise,<lb/>
After getting your letter, I wrote him that should<lb/>
he consider changing me to that area it would<lb/>
in no way inconvenience me now, (I thought,<lb/>
perhaps, he might hesitate to change my orders<lb/>
if he thought I have my family with me, etc-<lb/>
which I have not).</p>
<p>I believe that from the standpoint of scien-<lb/>
tific studies, the conditions <hi>under</hi> which and<lb/>
<hi>on</hi> which one would work in that area<lb/>
would be best for continuous investigations.<lb/>
I can see that work in Alabama will be<lb/>
divided into (1) studies in conditions of impounded<lb/>
waters and (2) assisting and advising on preventive<lb/>
measures based on what we already know<lb/>
or think <del>of</del> necessary to limit or prevent pond<lb/>
malaria. I fear that (2) will take up so<lb/>
much time in Alabama as to interrupt con-<lb/>
tinuous studies, which we know, from<lb/>
our standpoint, are the more important. Since the<lb/>
(over)<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01018009"/>
C1<lb/>
B21<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
since the promulgation of the I. W. regulations, <unclear>Mr.</unclear><lb/>
Hazlehurst says that ponds are beginning to show<lb/>
up, and they will probably be &ldquo;rushed with orders&rdquo;<lb/>
I think that we should have another engineer,<lb/>
aside from Le Prince, familiar with im-<lb/>
pounded waters. An engineer (trained) should<lb/>
be the better man for services with S. B. of H.<lb/>
<del>and</del> in advising on control of ponds. Since<lb/>
you are on &ldquo;Waiting Orders&rdquo;-(<hi>unfortunate</hi> for Service)<lb/>
Le Prince, a good second, and I, a <hi>poor third</hi><lb/>
are the only ones who could give the training.<lb/>
I should certainly suggest this, if I were ever<lb/>
asked for suggestions as to policy. I think<lb/>
Fisher would be <unclear>our</unclear> best man.</p>
<p>You may recall that I wrote you soon after<lb/>
the war- 1919- that I was sorry we couldn't<lb/>
stick more closely to investigations instead of<lb/>
getting so much into &ldquo;cooperative control.&rdquo; I<lb/>
don't dislike construction (I think you would<lb/>
say that my work just finished is one of, if<lb/>
not the best anywhere), but I feel that it<lb/>
would be my duty to do it, if I were a<lb/>
local health officer.</p>
<p>I hope your excellent advice will be<lb/>
followed, and pray that your hopes and desires<lb/>
that these studies be carried on to a logical con-<lb/>
clusion as to &ldquo;Relation of Impounded Waters to the<lb/>
Incidence of Malaria&rdquo; and the &ldquo;determination of the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01018010"/>
3<lb/>
methods of minimizing such incidence. My ability<lb/>
to help reach these results my opportunity through<lb/>
orders and personal limitations. The latter<lb/>
only I can strive to overcome - and<lb/>
I would do it for <hi>your satisfaction</hi>, to<lb/>
say nothing of other values.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to Miss Laura &amp; your good self.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>

P. S.<lb/>
I want to thank you for having Le P.<lb/>
send me Watson's, which I am now<lb/>
reading. If I should hurry with it, let<lb/>
me know<lb/>
