<salute>Dear Doctor Hench;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received a letter recently from General Truby, telling<lb/>
me of the dedication of Camp Lazear. In it he noted that<lb/>
all whom he had given credit to in his book were honored<lb/>
there, except Miss Warner, whom he did not remember.</p>
<p>I replying I stated that of course he had given her no<lb/>
mention as having helped the Y.F. experiments, for although<lb/>
she was there at the time he was head of the hospital he<lb/>
knew her only as Head Nurse of the female nurse corps.</p>
<p>I told him that I had known her quite well and met her often<lb/>
when talking to Nurse Holmes, of the receiving ward, as<lb/>
she and the latter were great friends. I never heard of<lb/>
her as being connected with the real experiments. She may<lb/>
have been around Lazear and Carroll when they were sick;-<lb/>
I don't know. I quoted Truby extracts from an address she<lb/>
had made to the Shelby County Med. Asso.</p>
<p>Truby asked me if I would send this &ldquo;printed matter&rdquo; to<lb/>
you and to tell you it was sent at his request. It is not<lb/>
printed matter, as he supposed, but a copy typed by Nurse<lb/>
Warner or at her direction. You may have probably seen<lb/>
it before, as she evidently had lots of copies, but, any-<lb/>
way, I send it as Truby requested. I have read for more<lb/>
incredible articles written by her relating to her service<lb/>
in Cuba. - A Baroness Munchausen!</p>
<p>There is nothing vindicitive in anything I say against<lb/>
this nurse, even though she did try to take credit that<lb/>
belonged to others, and I am sure Gen. Truby has no such<lb/>
feelings. I believe she should simply be dropped from any<lb/>
further publications realting to the Y.F. experiments.</p>
<p>After the ceremonies at Camp Lazear I looked eagerly though<lb/>
my magazines, &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; and many others, thinking that there<lb/>
would surely be some mention of such a Cuban-American<lb/>
event, but failed to find anything about it. I know there<lb/>
are lots of old vets who served at Col. Bks. who would be<lb/>
interested in it, so I used my old reportorial instincts<lb/>
and patched up what hints I could secure and sent a small<lb/>
take to the National Tribune, (the veteran's paper). Since<lb/>
receipt of Truby's letter, I find that I hit it close, in<lb/>
a very brief manner. I sent you a clipping, but I doubt<lb/>
you received it.</p>
<p>One other thing: General Truby has asked me about a John<lb/>
Peter Barnstad of the H. Corps at Col. Bks. I handled all<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04604002"/>
(Tate-Hench-2)<lb/>
the pay rolls, muster rolls, sick &amp; wounded rep<del>p</del>orts and<lb/>
all army orders there from Sept. 1900 to August 1901, and<lb/>
knew all Corps Men there personally. During that period<lb/>
I can remember no man there of that name.</p>
<p>Regret to learn from General Truby that no mention was made<lb/>
of Dr. Pinto. He was C.O. there when I arrived from Pinar<lb/>
del Rio just befor Truby took over. He took the <unclear>preliminary</unclear><lb/>
tests with mosquitoes before Lazear found out how the birds<lb/>
really worked. And no -mention of Capt. Stark! Excuse<lb/>
this long letter, but I don't know how to make it shorter.</p>
