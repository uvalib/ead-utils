THE NEW YORK ASSOCIATION OF BIOLOGY TEACHERS<lb/>
<date value="1926-11-22">November 22, 1926</date>
</dateline>
Hon. James E. Watson,<lb/>
Senator from Indiana.<lb/>
<salute>Honorable Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Do you know the story in recent American history that<lb/>
appeals most strongly to the high school boy or girl of today--the<lb/>
future citizens of our country? It is the story of the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Commission, consisting of Major Walter Reed, Dr. Jesse Lazear,<lb/>
Dr. Carroll and Dr. Aristides Agramonte, appointed after the<lb/>
Spanish American War by President McKinley. This marvellous story<lb/>
has been taught during the past quarter of a century by every<lb/>
bioloby teacher in the country.</p>
<p>There came in the course of these experiments a call for<lb/>
volunteers to submit themselves to the bites of mosquitos infected<lb/>
by yellow fever patients. John R. Kissinger was the first to respond.<lb/>
When he refused to accept any monetary compensation, Major Reed<lb/>
touched his cap and said, &ldquo;I salute you.&rdquo; Major Reed, in his<lb/>
official report to the United States Government (see Senate<lb/>
Document No. 822, p. 96) said, &ldquo;In my Judgment this exhibition of<lb/>
moral courage has never been surpassed in the annals of the Army of<lb/>
the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one can learn that this hero, Kissinger, has been a<lb/>
helpless invalid for years without feeling a distinct shock. He has<lb/>
been and <unclear>in</unclear> wholly incapacitated for work; his only income is a<lb/>
Government annuity of $100 a month; and for years his wife has<lb/>
taken in washing to pay for their support and for doctor's bills.<lb/>
The Kissingers are at present living in a small house in Andrews,<lb/>
Huntington County, Indiana. They have not the necessary income to<lb/>
provide the necessities for even reasonable comfort. How could they<lb/>
on an income of only $100 a month?</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03107004"/>
<p>2</p>
<p>The American people are much too generous to wish such treat-<lb/>
ment of their heroes. We know that the reason for such treatment<lb/>
is the fact that this condition has not been brought to the<lb/>
attention of Congressmen individually. We are bringing the matter<lb/>
to your attention, asking you to look after it personally, because<lb/>
it seems to us that it will seem to you not only your personal duty,<lb/>
but also your personal privilege, since this hero lives in your<lb/>
state.</p>
<p>While Congress is looking after the Kissinger case, should<lb/>
not adequate provision also be made for the widows of Major Reed,<lb/>
Dr. Lazear, and Dr. Carroll, who are living in straitened circumstances<lb/>
because their husbands gabe their lives in this cause? It goes<lb/>
without saying that we teachers will take more joy in telling this<lb/>
story and our boys and girls will feel more pride in their Country<lb/>
when they know these heroes are made comfortable while they live.<lb/>
An annuity of $250 per month for each of the four families would<lb/>
be sufficient. We respectfully urge you to present a bill in the<lb/>
Senate providing for this expenditure. While you are doing it,<lb/>
won't you provide for Mrs. Kissinger for the rest of her life, in<lb/>
case Mr. Kissinger should die first?</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
<signed>Charles G. Inman, President<lb/>
Elizabeth T. Fitzpatrick, Sec'y</signed>
