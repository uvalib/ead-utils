Havana, <date value="1938-06-26">June 26, 1938.</date>
</dateline>
Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
MAYO CLINIC,<lb/>
Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Please accept my most humble apologies for failing to reply<lb/>
to your own letter dated March 7th and to that of your Secretary, dated<lb/>
March 24th. I have had my hands full between the duties of my office<lb/>
on one hand and correspondence with reference to &ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo; on the<lb/>
other. By this time, you have probably seen &ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo; in the<lb/>
movies. If so, I will appreciate your opinion as to the part which<lb/>
your humble servant plays therein as &ldquo;Sergeant O'Hara&rdquo;, impersonated by<lb/>
Robert Montgomery. When MGM wrote me for permission to use my name<lb/>
in connection with the filmed version of &ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo;, the company wrote<lb/>
me at the same time for whatever information I could give as to the per-<lb/>
sonality of Dr. Finlay. About the same time the Havana papers were<lb/>
carrying on a campaign which roundly condemned the film, then under<lb/>
production, many of the articles claiming that Dr. Finlay was not even<lb/>
mentioned. To the end that local agitation might be allayed I pointed<lb/>
out to the producers that, unless the part played by Finlay in the picture<lb/>
was such as to satisfy Cuban sentiment, at least to a reasonable degree,<lb/>
the picture might face a boycott in Cuba and in other Latin-American<lb/>
countries. The decision to film &ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo; was apparently carried<lb/>
on by MGM with great haste, once the company decided to film it. The<lb/>
matter had been pending decision for over a year and when the company<lb/>
finally decided that &ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo; might be successfully filmed, action<lb/>
was rapid. It appears that it was before the camera for only six weeks<lb/>
as against three to six months before the camera for pictures of its now<lb/>
accepted category. The critics appear to be unanimous in pronouncing<lb/>
it one of the best pictures of the year, so far. One critic, writing in<lb/>
the July number of &ldquo;Red Book&rdquo; gives one the idea, reading between the lines,<lb/>
that although the picture cost only half a million dollars to film, it is<lb/>
in a class with pictures costing one to two million. I understand that<lb/>
MGM, based on recommendations made by me and others, spent an additional<lb/>
twenty thousand in reforming the parts of Finlay and Agramonte. Such<lb/>
reforms, so I am told is for Latin-American consumption only. It is<lb/>
rather unfortunate that Dr. Finlay, impersonated by Charles Coburn,<lb/>
appears wearing a monocle. He wore spectacles, which is far from being<lb/>
the same thing. The excuse given by MGM is that Charles Coburn, due to<lb/>
a defect in one eye, habitually wear a monocle. That explanation is not<lb/>
accepted in entire good faith by the Cubans, however, but talk of boycott-<lb/>
ing the picture has died down. It will not come to Cuba before the end of<lb/>
August or the first week of September, so I am informed by the local manager<lb/>
of MGM. I am to have a preview of the picture as soon as it reaches<lb/>
Havana. Was invited to Washington for the opening performance but side-<lb/>
stepped the honor of being presented on the Stage for a bow. My fellow<lb/>
guinea pig, Kissinger, was there with &ldquo;bells on&rdquo; and was feted and made<lb/>
much of. He grows fat on publicity. I get thin on it. The manager of<lb/>
Loew's theatre in the Capitol City gave the critics the idea that Kissinger<lb/>
was none other than Sergeant O'Hara. Well, so far as I am concerned, that<lb/>
is fair enough. It was good propaganda for MGM and made Kissinger the idol<lb/>
of Washington for a week. My friends there resent more than I do the <hi>steal-<lb/>
ing of the show</hi> by Kissinger. I am informed that Robert Montgomery talks<lb/>
for me in a rich Irish brogue. James Stewart who played the part in the<lb/>
original stage presentation had a thicker brogue than I have ever been able<lb/>
to claim.</p>

<p>With reference to the photos you sent ffor dedication and<lb/>
signature. I regret to state that I am not very well satisfied with<lb/>
their appearnce, after dedicating them to you on the face of the<lb/>
photographs. However, I am sending them to you. I used &ldquo;Quink&rdquo;<lb/>
(Parker) in writing and am far from satisfied with the finished product.<lb/>
Presumably there is a special ink or pencil for dedication of photographs<lb/>
but I used my fountain pen and the ink which I always use for signing<lb/>
current correspondence, etc. etc. If you do not like the photos in<lb/>
their present form, please let me know and I will have another taken for<lb/>
you and send you one of the regular photographs I had taken with dedication<lb/>
on the back on the black print and on the mounting for the brown finish.</p>
<p>I am curious to know if you ever read your paper for the Mayo<lb/>
Clinic which you had in mind when you originally wrote to me. With refer-<lb/>
ence to Dr. Crenshaw. It was foolish of me to think that he would<lb/>
remember me. We were classmates for one year only and he was not one of<lb/>
those whom I intimately knew. I think the best thing we can do is to<lb/>
forget all about one another since we have but one thing in common, viz:<lb/>
that we are both members of the UVA Alumnae. I do not now recall whether or<lb/>
not I told you in one of my previous letters that my Congressional Medal<lb/>
will eventually go to the University of Virginia. I want to make sure<lb/>
that it will not become lost in the shuffle. That chance I would have to<lb/>
take, of course, if a kindly Providence had favored me with a son or<lb/>
daughter.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for remembering me while you were abroad.<lb/>
I appreciate the postcard you sent me very much. I could keep on writing<lb/>
to the end of this page but my bettr half has just phoned me that I am due<lb/>
at home for dinner, this being Sunday. Kindly let me hear from you soon<lb/>
and remember that I have no secretary to write my letters for me. This in<lb/>
case you should feel that I take a long time to answer your letters.</p>
<p>With kindest personal regards, I remain,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours most sincerely,</salute>
