<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you very much for your kind letter of February<lb/>
27. At your suggestion, I communicated with Wyeth, Inc., this morn-<lb/>
ing, at Philadelphia, and learned that Mr. Frank Law is the Vice<lb/>
President. They have no New York office. In talking with Mr.<lb/>
Law, who was most cooperative, I learned that all matters relating to<lb/>
the Cornwell painting are being handled by Mr. Richard Roley, the<lb/>
Advertising Manager. Mr. Law put me into direct communication with<lb/>
Mr. Roley and he has generously consented to make colored inserts<lb/>
for us showing the numbers as they are shown in your own brochure in<lb/>
the black and white reproduction. When I wrote to you previously, I<lb/>
realized that the colored plates were available, and as I told you,<lb/>
they would be expensive for our printer to handle. But I did not in<lb/>
my wildest dreams look for such generosity as I met at the hands of<lb/>
Mr. Roley this morning, who has promised, not only to make inserts for<lb/>
us, but to handle them in any way that is suitable for our program.</p>
<p>I am, indeed, grateful to you for telling me about the<lb/>
existence of the plates and the fact that Wyeth would even consider<lb/>
making such a contribution to our program. (The inserts.)</p>
<p>I am awaiting a note from General Reed, to whom I wrote<lb/>
the same day as I addressed you, asking for his permission to re-<lb/>
produce any of the material which you have in your possession. I<lb/>
am sure I shall hear from him within a day or so. As I told you<lb/>
in my former letter, I am going through your list of memorabilia<lb/>
very carefully with a view to taking the whole matter up with Dr.<lb/>
Angell, and when we have decided upon what we wish to use we shall<lb/>
communicate with you again.</p>
<p>I note your suggestion that you would like to have the<lb/>
photo of the Congressional Medal used, as well as a photograph of<lb/>
Walter Reed in civilian clothes, taken aboard ship while he was en<lb/>
route to Cuba. I shall <add>call</add> particular attention to these when I dis-<lb/>
cuss the matter with Dr. Angell, and tell him that General Reed like-<lb/>
wise concurs in these choices.</p>
<p>With renewed appreciation of your great kindness,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours</salute>
