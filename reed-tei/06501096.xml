General Albert E. Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco, California<lb/>
<salute>Dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am pleased and greatly interested in<lb/>
your kind letter of January 16th. Was very sorry to learn<lb/>
that Colonel Stark has been gone these many years. That<lb/>
is one thing I don't like about the military services: A<lb/>
good, deserving man can in some cases work out his life<lb/>
for it and fail to get proper recognition.</p>
<p>Mine is only a layman's opinion, but I<lb/>
feel sure that Stark had everything to carry him to high<lb/>
rank, and for him to be in a position where he could be<lb/>
shelved by someone opposing him, could occur only in the<lb/>
military forces.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm sort of fanatical in re-<lb/>
gard to the medical profession. I have always thought<lb/>
that, in connection with the engineers, (but where would<lb/>
they be without doctors) that medicine is the greatest<lb/>
profession in the world.--No military rank can add to it.<lb/>
But in the services that is all one has to look forward<lb/>
to except personal satisfaction, and when a man is &ldquo;tops&rdquo;<lb/>
he should get top rank. I am surely glad that you had no<lb/>
inside enemies to stop your deserved advancement.</p>
<p>I remember when the detachment from Pinar<lb/>
del Rio arrived at Columbia Barracks. Of course, as you<lb/>
know, one of the first things an enlisted man asks upon<lb/>
reporting at a new station is, &ldquo;What kind of a C. O. have<lb/>
you?&rdquo; The report in this case was, &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; One fellow, an<lb/>
old soldier, remarked, &ldquo;Hell, he looks more like a cavalry<lb/>
officer than a doctor!&rdquo; I well remember that you did have<lb/>
a sort of dashing, military appearance.</p>
<p>Regarding your kind interest as to my<lb/>
welfare in Berkeley: For about ten years previous to the<lb/>
depression years my wife and I conducted a 12- acre Buff<lb/>
Leghorn poultry ranch and hatchery at Orinda. We operated<lb/>
three batteries of incubators and hatched and sold over<lb/>
a thousand chicks a week.</p>
<p>Did very well until Hoof and Mouth disease<lb/>
struck that locality and a dumb-head inspector included<lb/>
baby chicks among live stock forbidden shipment. (A chick,<lb/>
hatched after 20 days in an incubator and at once trans-<lb/>
ferred to shipping container could not possibly transmit<lb/>
this disease)</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06501097"/>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Three months of these restrictions put us in<lb/>
financial difficulties, and just as we were recovering #<lb/>
the great depression struck and that put us out of busi-<lb/>
ness and we moved to Berkeley. I wrote fiction for the<lb/>
pulps for awhile, but at that time there was no steady<lb/>
living in it. Joined the Berkeley Unemployment Associ-<lb/>
ation and became one of the directors until we dissolved<lb/>
the corporation. Then I decided to advance thirty years<lb/>
the old saying &ldquo;that life begins at forty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At seventy years of age I wrote some letters<lb/>
to various big manufacturing firms, applying for work; of<lb/>
course omitting my age until the interview. This was be-<lb/>
fore the war, but the manager of the H. J. Heinz Co. (57<lb/>
Varities) laughed at my age and gave me a temporary job<lb/>
in the stock room of their big plant.</p>
<p>I worked until the job was over. Before I could<lb/>
take another place offered me by the Cal. Ink Co., Heinz<lb/>
Co. called me back for a permanent job with them. Two years<lb/>
later I was a key man, head of the receiving department.<lb/>
Kept that until late 1946 when all men there over 65 had<lb/>
to retire. As I was 75 I couldn't object! They even gave<lb/>
me a retirement check, which was pretty good seeing that<lb/>
I had <hi>begun</hi> work there when five years <hi>past</hi> the retirement<lb/>
age!</p>
<p>Upon taking this job I spent my last dollar as<lb/>
down payment on a house, (and was I lucky to get it!) A<lb/>
$4,000. house that called for monthly payments for eight<lb/>
years. As I received good pay I completed my payments in<lb/>
four years. (Could have sold it during the war for $10,000.)</p>
<pb n="3" id="f06501098"/>
<p>So now, with my pension and Social Security and<lb/>
no rent to pay, I manage to get along very nicely in a<lb/>
modest way. So do you blame me for feeling a little proud<lb/>
of coming through so well after 70 years of age?</p>
<p>I've been interested in the Yellow Fever (Jungle)<lb/>
experiments in Africa by Doctor Stokes and others. I wrote<lb/>
<del>I wrote</del> to Doctor R. M. Taylor, of the Rockefeller Foun-<lb/>
dation for some literature on the matter. He sent me a per-<lb/>
sonal letter and enclosed a pamphlet on &ldquo;The Epidemiology<lb/>
of Yellow Fever,&rdquo; being extracts from proceedings of the<lb/>
Congress of Tropical Medicine, at Washington, 1948., and<lb/>
said he would have the Publication Department send me other<lb/>
literature regarding the matter.</p>
<p>What I can't understand is that mosquito--carried<lb/>
Yellow Fever has reached from the South American jungles<lb/>
to America many times during 200 years, and now we know<lb/>
the vector and destroy it we have no more Yellow Fever in<lb/>
America. They have this same mosquito (and several other<lb/>
vectors in Africa) yet Yellow Fever has never been a great<lb/>
scourge along Southern Europe or North African Cities.<lb/>
Yet they claim that the virus strains isolated in Africa<lb/>
and America are virtually identical. Well, I'm no scien-<lb/>
tist, but it sounds funny. The Rockefeller Foundation<lb/>
Publicity Department says they are sending me a list of<lb/>
their publications from which I can select any I may wish<lb/>
and they will send them to me, so perhaps I will learn more<lb/>
about the African experiments.</p>
<p>I have not yet heard from the book store that<lb/>
said they would try to get a copy of your book for me, so<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06501099"/>
(4)<lb/>
I guess they will not succeed. When I am next in Oakland<lb/>
I will try the stores there, for I certainly want to get<lb/>
a copy.</p>
<p>Please do not think when you read these long,<lb/>
disconnected letters of mine that I expect you to reply<lb/>
to them in detail, or even think that you &ldquo;owe me a let-<lb/>
ter&rdquo;--Not for anything would I wish that--I know you have<lb/>
too many intimate things of your own to think of. Simply<lb/>
think of me as a garrulous old man who likes to put his<lb/>
thoughts graphically instead of vocally and hopes it won't<lb/>
bore. You can't stop a talker, but a letter is like a radio,<lb/>
you can cut it out when you wish, and with that thought<lb/>
I'll ramble along.</p>
<p>I just received a copy of the Congressional Joint<lb/>
Resolution, 396, establishing a Walter Reed Commemeration<lb/>
Commission, sent me by Representative Bland, of Virginia.<lb/>
I think it would be a wonderful tribute to Major Walter<lb/>
Reed and all concerned. I will encolose you the copy, as<lb/>
I have another sent me by Senator Jenner, of Indiania, who<lb/>
presented it to the Senate. It must be having effect<lb/>
even before it it is passed, for I heard a radio talk this<lb/>
morning by a Doctor King, on the Yellow Fever experiments<lb/>
in Cuba.</p>
<p>With very best wishes to you,</p>

<salute>Sincerely &amp; Cordially Yours,</salute>
