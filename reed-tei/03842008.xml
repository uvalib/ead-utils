Mrs. Estella Rodriguez-Leon<lb/>
15 St. No. 311<lb/>
Vedado, Havana<lb/>
Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs. Rodriguez-Leon:</salute>
</opener>
<p>If my plans work out, I hope to be in Cuba the latter part of next<lb/>
month for one or two weeks. I sincerely hope that you will be there and that I<lb/>
may have the privilege of calling on you again. I am wondering whether I shall<lb/>
be so fortunate as to be able to see some of your father's material which I believe<lb/>
was packed away in your other home. I am hoping so very much that I can.</p>
<p>Let me write you about another but related matter. The John Wyeth Co.,<lb/>
an old reputable pharmaceutical house in Philadelphia, has begun a series of fine<lb/>
paintings on medical subjects. They are done by a nationally known artist and two<lb/>
have already appeared, one on Dr. Beaumont and one on Dr. Osler. Thousands of copies<lb/>
of each have been disseminated throughout the country and the original paintings are<lb/>
being exhibited in various medical institutions. They plan to do a painting con-<lb/>
cerned with the conquest of yellow fever. When I heard of this I wrote asking of<lb/>
their plan hoping that I might obtain the original or an oil copy of the original<lb/>
for the little museum building which I hope to see built in Havana to memorialize<lb/>
Camp Lazear. The two men concerned with the development of the painting, Mr. George<lb/>
Kellogg and Mr. Withington, learned that I knew some interesting data and came out<lb/>
to see me. I was amazed at the detail which they have already demonstrated<lb/>
in planning these paintings. They have had some difficulty in determining what kind<lb/>
of uniforms your father and the other physicians wore. They also asked me if other<lb/>
photographs of your father were available showing his face from several angles. It<lb/>
is possible that they may write to you enlisting your help in these two points. I<lb/>
know that you will want to have your father portrayed as accurately as possible. I<lb/>
can assure you that I have no ulterior motive or connection with this venture except<lb/>
a desire to see justice done to the members of the commission and to insure as much<lb/>
historical accuracy as possible within the limits of reasonable artistic license.<lb/>
Mr. Kellogg informs me that the Wyeth Co. would be delighted to defray any expenses<lb/>
incident to copying some photographs of your father. They already have the convention-<lb/>
al poses as published in Kelly's book. Do you by any fortunate chance still have one<lb/>
of your father's uniforms? A description of it, whether it was white or khaki, and<lb/>
what insignia were on the collar or shoulder strap would be very helpful information.<lb/>
The preliminary sketches of the painting are in process and they hope to finish it<lb/>
within the next month or two. Doubtless, you will be hearing from Mr. Kellogg but I<lb/>
wanted to write you to let you know a little something about their plans.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
