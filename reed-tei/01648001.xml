<salute>My dear little &ldquo;B.&rdquo;;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Just as I<lb/>
had taken up my pen, last<lb/>
evening, for the purpose of wri-<lb/>
ting, I was interrupted by the<lb/>
entrance of Lieutenant Tabor.<lb/>
The said gentleman is one of<lb/>
the most sober and dignified<lb/>
officers at Willet's Point,<lb/>
and being a married man, is<lb/>
very little given to visiting.<lb/>
In fact, this was the first<lb/>
visit he had paid me, although<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01648002"/>
it is more than a month since<lb/>
I arrived. I am told that he<lb/>
is opposed to all such in-<lb/>
nocent amusements as dan-<lb/>
cing, going to theatres, card-<lb/>
playing, etc. Just such a char-<lb/>
acter as you most admire-<lb/>
speaking of &ldquo;card-playing,&rdquo; re-<lb/>
minds me that I have been<lb/>
requested to join in the game<lb/>
more than once since my<lb/>
advent into Army life, but have<lb/>
as often respectfully de-<lb/>
clined. It was solely owing<lb/>
to my promise to you that I<lb/>
did not indulge. After all,<lb/>
my darling, I do not regret<lb/>
that you made the request,<lb/>
for although I may seem<lb/>
unaccommodating to others,<lb/>
yet I never did derive much<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01648003"/>
pleasure from the game. Under-<lb/>
stand that I would have<lb/>
abandoned it with equal read-<lb/>
iness, had it been one of my<lb/>
dearest idols- Did I tell you<lb/>
that I had begun chess-play-<lb/>
ing? Dr Byrne, who is something<lb/>
of a player, has kindly con-<lb/>
sented to teach me. I have<lb/>
played several games with<lb/>
him, and if my head was only<lb/>
large enough, intellectually,<lb/>
I should be wonderfully<lb/>
delighted with the game. As<lb/>
it is, I like it. To you, it<lb/>
would be especially interes-<lb/>
ting, for you not only have<lb/>
one of the greatest minds in<lb/>
this country, <hi>but also a math-<lb/>
ematical one</hi>, which, I am<lb/>
told, is a great help to a<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01648004"/>
chess-player. Imagine me playing<lb/>
with you and being <hi>scolded</hi><lb/>
for moving so slowly &amp; then<lb/>
losing every game! I know<lb/>
it would be the case. But, never<lb/>
mind, I will persevere &amp; become<lb/>
as proficient as I possibly<lb/>
can. I know you'll not be so<lb/>
unkind as not <add>to</add> permit me to<lb/>
win a game <hi>occasionally</hi>.<lb/>
I could but smile at your<lb/>
remarks on my progress in<lb/>
French. You certainly have a<lb/>
better opinion of my capacity<lb/>
than I had imagined, if you<lb/>
think that a few months will<lb/>
suffice to place me on an<lb/>
equal footing with yourself-<lb/>
If you only knew how very<lb/>
slow<del>ing</del> my progress is, I'm a-<lb/>
fraid that you would despair<lb/>
of my ever acquiring the language.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01648005"/>
In the first place, I haven't<lb/>
a teacher, which is a very<lb/>
great draw-back; &amp; then I<lb/>
am studying the most<lb/>
unsatisfactory grammar, imag-<lb/>
inable. Add to these a very dull<lb/>
head, &amp; you'll not have much<lb/>
difficulty in ascertaining my<lb/>
success. My only object is<lb/>
to learn just enough of the lan-<lb/>
guage as not to appear too<lb/>
stupid, when you begin to<lb/>
teach me. What fun it will<lb/>
be to conjugate the various<lb/>
verbs, such <add>as</add> &ldquo;aimer,&rdquo; etc.!</p>
<p>To change the subject, I received<lb/>
a letter from &ldquo;Mr Kit&rdquo; a few<lb/>
days ago- He made many inqui-<lb/>
ries of you and wanted a<lb/>
full description of my recent<lb/>
visit to Murfreesboro. Ac-<lb/>
cordingly I sat down &amp;<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01648006"/>
wrote him a most glowing ac-<lb/>
count. I did not forget to tell him<lb/>
that Mr Smith was most attentive<lb/>
to cousin Betsy. In fact, I gave<lb/>
him a most exaggerated ac-<lb/>
count of that gentleman's progress;<lb/>
enough to cause each sepa-<lb/>
rate hair to assume a ver-<lb/>
tical direction- I did not tell<lb/>
him who my informer was.<lb/>
It would not surprise me, if<lb/>
he should leave Kansas forth-<lb/>
with &amp; seek the borders of Hest-<lb/>
ford without delay. May the bra-<lb/>
vest win! Do you ever hear<lb/>
from Harrisonburg? If so, I<lb/>

would like to know if all are<lb/>
well. I presume that I will<lb/>
never get another letter from<lb/>
Ma. She is surely the poorest<lb/>
correspondent I ever knew.<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01648007"/>
Only <hi>one</hi> letter since my arrival<lb/>
here, and that a short one!<lb/>
Has Mrs Vaughan returned to<lb/>
Norfolk? She was at H'burg<lb/>
when I last heard from home.<lb/>
I have been recently reading<lb/>
a book of poems by &ldquo;Fitz-<lb/>
Greene Halleck.&rdquo; some of<lb/>
his poems are very good &amp;<lb/>
contain much truth- Occasion-<lb/>
ally, he falls into a mistake<lb/>
which mars the beauty of his<lb/>
poetry. For instance, the fol-<lb/>
lowing verse, taken from his<lb/>
tribute to &ldquo;woman&rdquo;;<lb/>
&ldquo;What is man's love? His vows are broke,<lb/>
Even while his parting Kiss is warm;<lb/>
But woman's love all change will mock,<lb/>
And, like the ivy round the oak,<lb/>
Cling closest in the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely he knew very<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01648008"/>
little of the world when he<lb/>
wrote that. Perhaps it is justly<lb/>
attributable to his tender years,<lb/>
at the time he wrote it. Or perhaps,<lb/>
the maidens, in his day, were<lb/>
truer than those of to-day. If<lb/>
the verse was <hi>reversed</hi>, I could<lb/>
find no difficulty in subscri-<lb/>
bing <add>to</add> it, but as it stands, I can<lb/>
only regard it as a very pretty<lb/>
poetical figure.  <hi>This is irony</hi>!</p>
<p>You will pardon me for thus<lb/>
abruptly terminating my letter,<lb/>
as I have been tormented<lb/>
for the past 24 hours with a<lb/>
very severe headache &amp; am<lb/>
still suffering with it.</p>
<closer>
<salute>I remain, as ever,<lb/>
yours, devotedly,</salute>
