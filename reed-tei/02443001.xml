<salute>My dear Doctor:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been trying to get a chance to write to you ever since I<lb/>
landed here last Tuesday night at 8<hi rend="superscript">15</hi> pm o'clock. Of course, I was<lb/>
delighted to get your cable gram telling me that the 57 day old<lb/>
bird had brought Hanberry down &amp; that the 16 day insect had been a<lb/>
success with Sontag. I hope that Dr. Ames got Weatherwax to submit.<lb/>
If so, I prognosticate a failure, as I am inclined to think that he<lb/>
has already had a very mild attack. If he should be brought down<lb/>
by insects 63 days old, it would be worth hearing of. Our article<lb/>
appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association which<lb/>
arrived today. I corrected the proof &amp; sent it back promptly but of<lb/>
course in order to &ldquo;scoop&rdquo; all other journals he didn't wait for the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02443002"/>
corrected proof - not only that, the damned rascal took lots of<lb/>
liberty with our ms, such as wiping out the three sectons into<lb/>
which we had naturally divided the article &amp; put instead <hi>his<lb/>
own asinine head-lines</hi>! I swore a blue streak &amp; shall cuss him<lb/>
out by letter, but the damage is done - so much for sending the<lb/>
article to a <hi>yellow</hi> medical journal! I am trying to save the 500<lb/>
reprints from his damnable stupidity, and hope to do so. I am very<lb/>
sorry to have to tell you that you need not look for any promotion<lb/>
as the Secretary refused to fill any vacancies caused by Major<lb/>
Kean or other vacancies under that particular act -- only appointments<lb/>
will be made for Philippine service. It would be folly for you to<lb/>
do this. The general recommended you to fill Kean's vacancy.<lb/>
Weather here damnable until today. I have been swathed in flannels<lb/>
and overcoats until I am nearly dead. Almost <add>wish</add> thot that I was back<lb/>
in Cuba. Of course, I have been put on the Examining Board which<lb/>
meets Monday. Much love to the Kean's &amp; Starks. Kindest regards to<lb/>
Ames &amp; the others. Come back as soon as you can.</p>
<closer>
<salute>With best wishes,<lb/>
Sincerely yours,</salute>
