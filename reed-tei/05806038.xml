<title>Letter from John H. Andrus to Philip Showalter Hench, April 26, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Andrus writes that some of the enlisted men thought it highly unlikely that Lazear would have allowed a stray mosquito to bite him. It was known that Carroll was inoculated by mosquito-bite, but not clear if that was the cause of Carroll's disease as he also had been in the epidemic zone. He looks forward to Hench's comments on his manuscript.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I want you to know how very much I appreciate your kindness<lb/>
in coming to see me yesterday. Now that we have met I<lb/>
shall value your friendship more than ever...</p>
<p>Yesterday I made a statement with reference to Dr. Lazear's<lb/>
innoculation that was, upon reflection, entirely too broad.<lb/>
I told you that it was the &ldquo;general belief&rdquo; that Dr. Lazear<lb/>
had innoculated himself intentionally. I blush to confess<lb/>
that I had no means of knowing what the <hi>general belief</hi> was.<lb/>
All I actually <hi>know</hi> is that a few of the enlisted men of the<lb/>
Hospital Corps detachment - the only ones I heard on the sub-<lb/>
ject - thought it highly improbable that Dr. Lazear would<lb/>
allow <add>a</add> casual mosquito<del>es</del> to bite him in view of his belief that<lb/>
yellow fever was transmitted by mosquito-bite.</p>
<p>At the time of Dr. Lazear's death he was known to have innoc-<lb/>
ulated Dr. Carroll by mosquito-bite but it was not definitely<lb/>
known that the innoculation was the cause of Dr. Carroll's<lb/>
getting the disease. He had been in the epidemic zone.<lb/>
Dean's innoculation by Dr. Lazear was not known, generally,<lb/>
at that time. Dean was innoculated without military author-<lb/>
ity and the facts kept under cover until long afterward.</p>
<p>Hospital Steward John Neate - with whom I worked in Major<lb/>
Reed's laboratory - believed Dr. Lazear had innoculated him-<lb/>
self. I never heard the insurance angle until I read it<lb/>
in General Truby's manuscript...</p>
<p>Am looking forward to your comments on my &ldquo;story&rdquo; with a great<lb/>
deal of interest. I hope you will take your gloves off and<lb/>
be perfectly frank. I have no illusions about my abilities<lb/>
as a writer so the only way you could possibly surprise me<lb/>
would be to be complimentary. Compliments would not help<lb/>
while complete candor might enable me to rewrite the story to<lb/>
make it acceptable.</p>
<p>If Mr. Kellogg does not change his mind about getting Mr. Corn-<lb/>
wall to go to bat for me, I have renewed hope that one of the<lb/>
Hearst publications may use it. Even so, I would want to<lb/>
re-write it in accordance with your suggestions.</p>
<p>I realize that I am asking a lot. This should make you more<lb/>
careful in the future about just which dumb animals you are<lb/>
kind to.</p>
<p>With kindest regards,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>J H Andrus</signed>
