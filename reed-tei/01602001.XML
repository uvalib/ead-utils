<p>Our New Orleans Correspondence.</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS, August 7, 1853.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Yellow Fever--Increasing Mortality--Visit to<lb/>
the Hospital--Appearance of the Sick--The<lb/>
Weather, &amp;c.</hi></p>
<p>Whilom your correspondent in foreign parts, I<lb/>
hope to be recognized as an old acquaintance, and<lb/>
though I may not, as then, speak of most disastrous<lb/>
chances</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of moving accidents by flood and field,&rdquo;<lb/>
nor be able to indulge the marvellous and tell of<lb/>
&ldquo;Cannibals that each other eat,<lb/>
The anthropophagi and men whose heads<lb/>
Do grow beneath their shoulders,&rdquo;<lb/>
yet I hope that a few lines from this city may not<lb/>
prove amiss--welcome they cannot be, for they must<lb/>
speak of pestilence and death.</p>
<p>On my arrival here from &ldquo;more southern climes,&rdquo;<lb/>
after a long absence, I was congratulated at having<lb/>
made my escape from those sickly countries, and be-<lb/>
ing once more where life could be enjoyed. Little<lb/>
did many who thus spoke think how brief a lease<lb/>
they had on that enjoyment. The fell destroyer was<lb/>
soon to be among them--already was, but hidden as<lb/>
the snake in the grass. Most insiduous was his ap-<lb/>
proach--men began to think that there were a few<lb/>
more deaths than usual, a few more, and yet more,<lb/>
twenty-five, thirty, forty, fifty per day; men began<lb/>
to stare--'twas very strange! Yet no thought of an<lb/>
epidemic. A few more--sixty, seventy, eighty,<lb/>
ninety per day--then suddenly came the know-<lb/>
ledge that the yellow fever was in our midst;<lb/>
'twas time, &ldquo;men may live fools, but fools<lb/>
they cannot die&rdquo;--100, 125, 150, 200 per day of<lb/>
yellow fever. To this complexion have we come at<lb/>
last.</p>
<p>I enclose you an official report of interments for<lb/>
twenty-four hours, ending at 6 o'clock A. M., on<lb/>
Saturday the 6th inst., by which you will perceive<lb/>
that there were 238 deaths -- a terrible day's<lb/>
work--unparalleled in the history of New Orleans;<lb/>
10 every hour, 1 every six minvtes, in a city of about<lb/>
80,000 population! Until within a few days past the<lb/>
fever confined itself to the poorer class, but now it<lb/>
begins to strike higher, and at the corners of the<lb/>
streets you see men with gloomy faces, reading what<lb/>
is written on little square papers with black edges<lb/>
--drooping figure! tombstone and weeping willow!<lb/>
It is no longer the dead cart only that is to be seen,<lb/>
freighted with its cargo of six &ldquo;unknelled and un-<lb/>
known&rdquo; bodies--but the polished hearse, with black<lb/>
plumes nodding gracefully to the slow and measured<lb/>
tread of the dead march step, hourly makes its way<lb/>
to one of the cemetries. Such deaths have a most<lb/>
telling effect; even those who are acclimated<lb/>
begin to turn pale. Bury 150 per day of these poor<lb/>
wretches, who are only known numerically as &ldquo;so<lb/>
many,&rdquo; and men who have stood fire remain firm;<lb/>
commence thinning their own ranks, write obit-<lb/>
uary notices, and you find the bravest of<lb/>
<unclear>them-</unclear> quail. A telegraphic despatch was recei-<lb/>
ved here yesterday, announcing the death of<lb/>
Col. Bliss, at Pascagoula, of yellow fever. A sad and<lb/>
painful loss. It is natural that there should be an<lb/>
universal sentiment of deep regret; but, the feeling<lb/>
of dread and horror which his death creates, shows<lb/>
that there's something selfish in men's courage.</p>
<p>Almost every one who can leave town is doing so,<lb/>
many there are who cannot; they belong to the an-<lb/>
cient and well-known &ldquo;can't get-away club,&rdquo; others<lb/>
remain from philanthropy and do<unclear>all</unclear> the good they<lb/>
can--of the latter you find many in the &ldquo;Howard<lb/>
Charitable Association,&rdquo; who certainly deserve much<lb/>
credit for the noble and heroic manner they perform<lb/>
their sad duties.</p>
<p>In company with a friend, who felt a morbid curio-<lb/>
sity to witness the yellow fever in its most frightful<lb/>
form, I paid a visit to one of the temporary hospitals,<lb/>
lately established to meet the increased demand.<lb/>
We went in without the least ceremony. Alas!<lb/>
visiters are too scarce to have any rules to observe.<lb/>
We found about forty-five patients, evidently of the<lb/>
lower class; everything was being done for them<lb/>
that the nature of circumstances would permit of.</p>
<p>On one of the cots, surrounded by shaggy bearded<lb/>
men <unclear>was</unclear> a boy of about ten years of age; of those<lb/>
<unclear>around him</unclear> some were wild and raving, some patient<lb/>
and resigned, others gasping their last. The little<lb/>
fellow's pale face and light auburn hair drew me to-<lb/>
wards him; I spoke to him, but he answered not--I felt<lb/>
his pulse, and it was faint and flickering--the cold,<lb/>
clammy sweat of death was on his brow. &ldquo;He's<lb/>
quite aisy now,&rdquo; said the nurse, encouragingly; yes,<lb/>
quite <unclear>easy</unclear>. In a few moments his young spirit had<lb/>
taken flight. Who the father?--who the mother?<lb/>
None knew.</p>
<p>I heard a noise, and, looking in another direction,<lb/>
saw the huge, gaunt figure of a man spring from his<lb/>
cot, in the delirium of fever. He stood one moment<lb/>
gazing wildly around, coughed, and then came the<lb/>
the fatal sign--he threw from him his vitality--black<lb/>
vomit. I left the room, and stepped into the ante-<lb/>
chamber. &ldquo;Strap down No. 11,&rdquo; says the superin-<lb/>
tendent. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says the attendant, &ldquo;I suppose<lb/>
nothing else can keep him quiet;&rdquo; and thus, per-<lb/>
haps, did poor &ldquo;No. 11&rdquo; take his leap in the dark--<lb/>
thus passed away, without further record than his<lb/>
number. Men lose their individuality, and merge<lb/>
into figures.</p>
<p>The weather is hot and oppressive--almost daily<lb/>
showers, but they do not cool the atmosphere.<lb/>
When the broiling sun follows a rain, it is over-<lb/>
powering. Cool juleps are the only consolation.<lb/>
Ice, ice! the very word looks tempting on paper.<lb/>
So I'll adjourn for the present.<lb/>
