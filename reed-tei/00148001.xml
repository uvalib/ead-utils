</dateline>
<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wrote you a very<lb/>
hurried unsatisfactory letter last Wednesday<lb/>
morning. I was afraid it would not<lb/>
get off in time. But I know now<lb/>
that I had plenty of time, the mails<lb/>
are put on board the boat at<lb/>
Queenstown.</p>
<p>Monday night I reached London. On<lb/>
Tuesday morning I found lodgings and<lb/>
then went immediately to Barings<lb/>
where I found a letter and papers<lb/>
from you, I also got a letter this<lb/>
morning. They were both full of news<lb/>
and I enjoyed them very much. You<lb/>
must take care of your stomach and<lb/>
call in the doctor whenever you feel<lb/>
bad<del>ly</del>.</p>
<p>Tuesday afternoon I simply wandered<lb/>
around the streets and rode on the<lb/>
omnibuses in order to get my bearings<lb/>
and the general lay of the town<lb/>
On Wednesday I trotted around a great<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00148002"/>
deal hunting up steamship offices.<lb/>
I have engaged passage on the<lb/>
Rotterdam sailing from <del><unclear>A</unclear></del> Amsterdam<lb/>
on Sept. 6. I wanted to leave on<lb/>
the Spaarndam on Sept. 13 but she<lb/>
is full. However I left word that<lb/>
if anyone should give up a berth on<lb/>
the Spaarndam or a vacancy should<lb/>
occur in any way, I wanted the<lb/>
first chance at it. If I came by<lb/>
the Rotterdam which is probable I<lb/>
will reach New York on Sept. 18.<lb/>
If I get a berth on the Spaarndam<lb/>
I will reach there about the 24<hi>th</hi>.<lb/>
Waring reached here on Wednesday<lb/>
night and took a room in this<lb/>
house. Norris will come down<lb/>
next Monday. Waring goes to Paris<lb/>
the first of next week and sails<lb/>
from Boulogue on Aug. 9. Norris<lb/>
has not yet completed his plans.</p>
<p>I have seen quite a number of the<lb/>
sights here. I have been to St. Pauls.<lb/>
Westminster Abbey, Kensington Museum,<lb/>
Museum of Natural History besides seeing<lb/>
all the chief streets and many of the<lb/>
public buildings. Last night Waring and<lb/>
I went to Covent Garden to the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00148003"/>
Opera. They sang &ldquo;Esmeralda&rdquo; a new<lb/>
opera by a young composer named<lb/>
Thomas. It is really a very excellent<lb/>
thing and there are some very fine<lb/>
voices in the company which is French.<lb/>
London just now seems to have a<lb/>
craze for anything French.</p>
<p>Before leaving Edinburgh, I got four<lb/>
of those pebble - brooches that you<lb/>
spoke of. I got the prettiest that I<lb/>
could find, but I do not think much<lb/>
of them at the best.</p>
<p>I will send you a leaf or something<lb/>
if I can find one. The grass does<lb/>
not grow in the streets here by any<lb/>
means. There is more noise and bustle<lb/>
than in New York. They use omnibuses<lb/>
and there is always a jam.</p>
<p>I picked some heather in bloom<lb/>
on the side of Ben Lomond and<lb/>
I will send it to you in this.</p>
<p>Sight seeing is not a very restful<lb/>
exercise. I do not intend to rush<lb/>
things, I think it is a bad practice.<lb/>
It is better to see fewer things<lb/>
and see them right.</p>
<p>I have not done anything about the<lb/>
&ldquo;Post&rdquo;. I think it will be better to<lb/>
have it sent to New York, as I will<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00148004"/>
not have a permanent address here.</p>
<p>Saturday</p>
<p>Waring and I went to the British<lb/>
Museum yesterday afternoon. Of course<lb/>
we could not do justice to it in one<lb/>
visit, but we got a general idea<lb/>
of it and looked at some of the<lb/>
things carefully. This morning we<lb/>
went to Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospitals.<lb/>
At St. Thomas' we saw several operations<lb/>
by Sir William MacCoombe. They hold<lb/>
operations there on Wednesday and<lb/>
Saturday and at Guy's on Tuesday<lb/>
and Friday. At half past one in each<lb/>
place. I intend to go to them all<lb/>
while I am here. Another large<lb/>
hospital here is St. Bartholomew's.<lb/>
I am going to hunt it up this<lb/>
afternoon.</p>
<p>We tried to go to the Savoy last night<lb/>
where the &ldquo;Gondoliers&rdquo; is still running but<lb/>
it was full up so we went to a variety<lb/>
theatre on Leicester Square called the<lb/>
Empire. They had a very gorgeous<lb/>
performance. I will try to get to the<lb/>
Savoy again probably to-night. Drury Lane<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00148005"/>
theatre is closed, it will open soon<lb/>
but hardly before I leave. There<lb/>
are a great many other theatres open<lb/>
with good plays and companies.</p>
<p>Daly's company is at the Lyceum<lb/>
playing &ldquo;As You Like It,&rdquo; It has made<lb/>
quite a hit here. Nat Goodwin an<lb/>
American comedian is at the Gaiety.</p>
<p>The Hospitals I was at this morning are<lb/>
on the other side of the Thames. We<lb/>
crossed by London Bridge and came<lb/>
back by Westminster Bridge. St. Thomas'<lb/>
is on the Albert Embankment<lb/>
immediately opposite the Houses<lb/>
of Parliament. It is very large<lb/>
and fine.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
