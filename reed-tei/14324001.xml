Columbia Bks, Cuba-<lb/>
<date value="1900-11-05">Nov 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1900</date>
</dateline>
<salute>My dearest Gran</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have arisen early<lb/>
in the morning to have<lb/>
my letter catch todays<lb/>
mail, and try to make<lb/>
my peace with you, for<lb/>
I know that you will be<lb/>
disappointed to hear that<lb/>
we are not coming back<lb/>
to the U. S. for yet a little<lb/>
while, For I have been<lb/>
given my choice and have<lb/>
elected to be Post Surgeon<lb/>
at Columbia Bks rather<lb/>
than at M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Henry- The<lb/>
sacrifice in rank in pay<lb/>
and in responsibilities in-<lb/>
<unclear>voled</unclear> in accepting the<lb/>
latter was too great altho,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14324002"/>
the opportunities for Study<lb/>
would be <unclear>fine - and</unclear> the<lb/>
post is one of my choice.<lb/>
The way of the matter was<lb/>
this. The good General<lb/>
when in Washington asked<lb/>
that Mickie &amp; I, the only<lb/>
two of his old 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Corps<lb/>
staff left him, be sent<lb/>
with him to Omaha- As<lb/>
there was no regular S. G.<lb/>
at Omaha it was readily<lb/>
granted in Mickie's case<lb/>
but a Col. had recently<lb/>
been sent there as Chief<lb/>
Surgeon so it was out of<lb/>
the question for me- When<lb/>
the General told me of this<lb/>
application I thanked him<lb/>
but said I did not care<lb/>
to go to the U. S. if I had to<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14324003"/>
surrender my Vol. commission as Major,<lb/>
as is the Custom in the Med Corps-<lb/>
So the General at once cabled the S. G.<lb/>
&ldquo;Kean does not wish station in U. S. unless<lb/>
he can retain Vol. commission&rdquo;- About<lb/>
this time in the day along came the family<lb/>
cable of congratulation, which showed that<lb/>
something was in the wind for me-<lb/>
Later in the day the S. G. cabled <unclear>me-</unclear><lb/>
&ldquo;I shall expect you to resign your Vol. com-<lb/>
mission as <unclear>Major</unclear> two minutes after your<lb/>
arrival at Fort M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Henry. Do you prefer<lb/>
to remain in Cuba&rdquo;- To which after<lb/>
seeing <unclear>Havard</unclear> the Chief Surgeon of Div. I<lb/>
cabled that I preferred to remain in<lb/>
Cuba as a Major- The difference<lb/>
in pay including the 10% for tropical<lb/>
service is $900-a year- Havard has<lb/>
been very nice in wishing me to stay &amp;<lb/>
in offering me the best station in Cuba,<lb/>
and Stark has been also very generous<lb/>
in expressing his willingness to give <unclear>up</unclear><lb/>
Columbia Bks &amp; go to Matanzas-</p>
<p>So I am settled <unclear>now till</unclear> spring - and<lb/>
shall try to pay my debts instead of con-<lb/>
tracting more <del>of</del> as I would have had to do<lb/>
to move and outfit the family with winter<lb/>
clothes-</p>
<pb n="4" id="f14324004"/>
<p>Well my little family<lb/>
came back to me look-<lb/>
ing as fine as fiddles-<lb/>
Louis has, I suppose<lb/>
written you of her trip<lb/>
down- Bobbie is a<lb/>
fine lad, and his<lb/>
profile is his Gran's<lb/>
over again. He is a<lb/>
<unclear>Hurlbut</unclear> all over and<lb/>
you should have exer-<lb/>
cised your right to<lb/>
give him the <unclear>Hurlbut</unclear><lb/>
name- tho. his name<lb/>
as well as the good little<lb/>
rascal himself, give<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14324005"/>
me constant pleasure-<lb/>
We are still camping<lb/>
out in Gen. Lee's cot-<lb/>
tage which he will now<lb/>
not occupy- When we<lb/>
will move out of there<lb/>
into a house of our own<lb/>
I dont know, but it will<lb/>
be soon- The Dept will<lb/>
break up the middle<lb/>
of the month &amp; I will then<lb/>
go to Col. Bks- Gen<lb/>
Wood &amp; his Staff all<lb/>
coming out to our Hdqrs.<lb/>
as the fever is worse now<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14324006"/>
in Havana than it has been this<lb/>
summer- But there is none at<lb/>
all out here, and the only three<lb/>
cases at Columbia Bks in since<lb/>
August have been caused by<lb/>
<hi>mosquito inoculations</hi>- So you<lb/>
see as long as Louise <unclear>dont</unclear> offer<lb/>
herself &amp; the children to Reed<lb/>
for experimental purposes they<lb/>
are perfectly safe-</p>
<p>Reed will be back on Wednesday<lb/>
His discovery is I believe of incalcu-<lb/>
lable value to Cuba and the<lb/>
United States, and will give him<lb/>
enduring fame in his profession-<lb/>
<unclear>He</unclear> can, and will both check the<lb/>
breeding of mosquitoes in towns &amp;<lb/>
prevent their infection from yellow<lb/>
fever cases, &amp; thus prevent the<lb/>
propagation of the disease-</p>
<p>With much love</p>
