<salute>Dear Phil,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Under separate cover I am sending you a copy of the<lb/>
american Exporter (in Spanish) which carries a picture and story<lb/>
on &ldquo;Conquerors of Yellow Fever&rdquo; on page 38.</p>
<p>I spent an evening last week with Col. Siler, as I<lb/>
wrote you. He is now president of Gorgas Institute and back in<lb/>
active service, being a member of the two boards in some way<lb/>
associated with the Surgeon General's office. He was most co-<lb/>
operative and said that he would like to be of help to the mag-<lb/>
azine (ARMY DOCTOR) but by necessity of his present active duty<lb/>
he would have to consult the Surgeon General'personally. I don't<lb/>
know just what the outcome will be but my prognosis is that they<lb/>
will recommend someone less active than Col. Siler. What we really<lb/>
need on the job is a youngman.</p>
<p>I have pictures of the Reeds and the Keans which I will<lb/>
send you at an early date. I had cocktails with Gen. Reed Saturday<lb/>
afternoon and he asked me to forward the following message.</p>
<p>When the recommendations for your commission came up to<lb/>
the Craig board in the War Department it just happened that your<lb/>
application came into Gen. Reed's hands. As you may know, there are<lb/>
six generals on this Board who pass on all commissions and promo-<lb/>
tions in the army with the possible exceptions of those of the 2nd<lb/>
lieutenant. Gen. Reed wanted me to tell you that he told the Board<lb/>
that he was both happy and honored to present your application for<lb/>
the comission and that he had the privilege of telling them quite<lb/>
a story about your research on the &ldquo;Yellow Fever&rdquo; project. It goes<lb/>
without saying that your commission was passed unanimously by the<lb/>
Board.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised with Gen. Reed as he could<lb/>
pass for being considerably younger than the 64 years he admits<lb/>
and he is an all around good fellow. The way he feels about you<lb/>
is that if someone will propose that you be made a general at the<lb/>
end of six months I don't think you will encounter any obstacles<lb/>
whatsoever. If I were you, I would bear that in mind. Reed is<lb/>
certainly in a key position.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
