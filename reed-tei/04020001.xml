Dr. Edgar Mayer<lb/>
Four Seventy Park Avenue<lb/>
New York, New York<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Mayer:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciate indeed your additional letter of February 18.<lb/>
I have heard nothing from Dr. Fishbein except his initial letter.<lb/>
I don't know whether or not he has done anything to try to get me<lb/>
to New York on March 16. As a matter of fact, a family crisis has<lb/>
just <unclear>arisen</unclear> which will make it impossible for me to be there on<lb/>
that day. My wife was to have presented me with a baby on March 13,<lb/>
but the baby was born here last week. My wife and the baby are<lb/>
doing splendidly and we are taking the baby home on March 12, and<lb/>
you can understand my personal desire to be there throughout my ten<lb/>
day leave. The Army is very strict about giving leaves, and <del>where</del><add>were</add><lb/>
I to come to New York as part of my personal leave, I would lose<lb/>
that week of being home. We are only allowed about a month a year,<lb/>
and guard the days very jealously so that we can get home about ten<lb/>
days three times a year. Those officers who do not have their fam-<lb/>
ilies with them hate very much to have anything interfere with the<lb/>
precious days with their families.</p>
<p>Of course, if the Surgeon General's Office ordered me to<lb/>
any medical meeting, I would be allowed to go<del>t</del> without using my per-<lb/>
sonal leave time. I wonder if the Surgeon General's Department would<lb/>
be willing to order me to such a medical meeting. If there is a<lb/>
later meeting of the Institute, I could request detached service to<lb/>
attend this meeting. I would have to pay my own way, but the time<lb/>
would not be counted against me. If the Army would not order me<lb/>
there, I would be glad to come on my own if it could be done as de-<lb/>
tached service. When is the next meeting after the March 16th<lb/>
meeting?</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
