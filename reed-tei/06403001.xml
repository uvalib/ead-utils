<salute>My dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your brave and cheerful<lb/>
letter written on Dec. 26 made<lb/>
me very happy and <unclear>gave</unclear> a<lb/>
good start to the New Year. It<lb/>
is perfectly fine the way you have<lb/>
recovered from what you very<lb/>
properly call your cerebral accident<lb/>
and with your charming wife and<lb/>
your daughters and grand daughter<lb/>
around you to wait on you and<lb/>
spoil you, you will want never to get<lb/>
quite well- Col. Hench has been in<lb/>
to see me several times- He arri-<lb/>
ved a week ago with a huge box of<lb/>
Walter Reeds letters including his<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06403002"/>
2<lb/>
his love letters to Mrs Reed when he<lb/>
was courting her, and the biggest scrap<lb/>
book I ever saw- These he had<lb/>
borrowed from Mrs Reed and<lb/>
Blossom when he stopped by<lb/>
Blue Ridge Summit to see them<lb/>
when he came last- I glanced over<lb/>
the scrap book but did not tackle<lb/>
the bundles of domestic correspondence<lb/>
He came in on Thursday 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> at 7 <unclear>p m</unclear><lb/>
with Mrs Franck from the Office of the<lb/>
Military Surgeons <add>as stenog,</add> to try to extract<lb/>
a few last details from my fading<lb/>
memories of 43 years ago- He wants<lb/>
to get some light on when Reed first<lb/>
began to consider seriously the mosqui-<lb/>
to theory- Whether he did so before he<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06403003"/>
3<lb/>
came to Cuba with the Y. F. Board<lb/>
<unclear>on</unclear> June 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- I cannot give him any<lb/>
light on that point as I was sick<lb/>
with y. f. when he arrived and went<lb/>
off on leave as soon as I was able<lb/>
to travel and when I returned to<lb/>
Cuba on Aug, 20 he was in Washington<lb/>
So I did not have any talk with<lb/>
him on that subject until the decisions<lb/>
had been reached to try out the Finlay<lb/>
theory- I have suggested to him to<lb/>
write to Dr. L. O. Howard with whom he<lb/>
talked mosquitoes before he left Washing-<lb/>
ton in June- Dr. Howard is now <unclear>in</unclear><lb/>
New York and I think has failed<lb/>
a good deal mentally but he maybe<lb/>
able to recall something of value-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06403004"/>

He wanted me to describe in detail<lb/>
Lazear's funeral, but we had quite<lb/>
a number of funerals <add>about that time</add> and they are<lb/>
much confused and vague in my<lb/>
recollections- Gen. Lee &amp; his staff went<lb/>
to there mounted, as the dear old fellow<lb/>
much preferred to sit on a horse to<lb/>
standing &amp; walking on his short sturdy<lb/>
legs, and the horse rather was a division<lb/>
to his feelings- At least that is my<lb/>
idea of the psychology of his ordering his<lb/>
horse to go half a mile-</p>
<p>Well old man give my love to all your<lb/>
girls. I hope you will all be as happy<lb/>
all the year as I believe you to be<lb/>
at present-</p>

<salute>Your friend affectionately</salute>
