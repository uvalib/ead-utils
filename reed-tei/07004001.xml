<p>Antonio Benino</p>
<p>The undersigned, Antonio Benino<lb/>
being more than twenty-five years of age, native of Cerceda,<lb/>
in the province of Corima, the son of Manuel Benino<lb/>
and Josefa Castro here states by these presents, being in<lb/>
the enjoyment and exercise of his own very free will, that he consents<lb/>
to submit himself to experiments for the purpose of determining the<lb/>
methods of transmission of yellow fever, made upon his person by the<lb/>
Commission appointed for this purpose by the Secretary of War of the<lb/>
United States, and that he gives his consent to undergo the said ex-<lb/>
periments for the reasons and under the conditions below stated.</p>
<p>The undersigned understands perfectly well that in case of the<lb/>
development of yellow fever in him, that he endangers his life to a<lb/>
certain extent but it being entirely impossible for him to avoid the<lb/>
infection during his stay in this island, he prefers to take the<lb/>
chance of contracting it intentionally in the belief that he will<lb/>
receive from the said Commission the greatest care and the most skill-<lb/>
ful medical service.</p>
<p>It is understood that at the completion of these experiments, with-<lb/>
in two months from this date, the undersigned will receive the sum of<lb/>
$100 in American gold and that in case of his contracting yellow fever<lb/>
at any time during his residence in this camp, he will receive in addi-<lb/>
tion to that sum a further sum of $100 in American gold, upon his re-<lb/>
covery and that in case of his death because of this disease, the<lb/>
Commission will transmit the said sum (two hundred American dollars)<lb/>
to the person whom the undersigned shall designate at his convenience.</p>
<p>The undersigned binds himself not to leave the bounds of this camp<lb/>
during the period of the experiments and will forfeit all right to the<lb/>
benefits named in this contract if he breaks this agreement.</p>
<p>And to bind himself he signs this paper in duplicate, in the Experi-<lb/>
mental Camp, near Quemados, Cuba, on the 26th day of November<lb/>
nineteen hundred.</p>
