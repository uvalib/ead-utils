<salute>Dear Jack:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you very much (a) for the remainder of the Bibliography,<lb/>
as typed by Miss Frederick and (b) the card file, from which it was<lb/>
typed. Both reached me this morning. I agree that it was safer for you<lb/>
to hold your copy of the Bibliography as a &ldquo;control&rdquo; until we got <del>yours</del><lb/>
our carboncopy. I had hoped that might be two carbon copies of the<lb/>
Bibliography, but since this <add>is</add> not the case, Miss Brown and I will go<lb/>
ahead with the one you sent us and only accept your offer to send over<lb/>
the original if the corrections prove so extensive as to make it advis-<lb/>
able for the two copies to be identical. This prior to the final typ-<lb/>
ing for Colonel Russell.</p>
<p>I have, of course, only glanced over the additional pages of<lb/>
the Bibliography, which looks extremely well in its typed form. For this,<lb/>
my felicitations to Miss Frederick! I note with regret, though not with<lb/>
surprise, considering how much of the last part of the work you had to<lb/>
do under pressure, that Gorgas' name does not appear in the Bibliogra-<lb/>
phy. As you may remember, our tentative plan was to put it in <hi>re</hi><lb/>
&ldquo;critical number&rdquo; of <hi>aegypti</hi>, as adapted from Ross' (1911) &ldquo;critical<lb/>
number&rdquo; for Anopheles (Sec. 1. p. 30, original MS). <add>This, if you could<lb/>
find no better reference.</add></p>
<p>In reading over the MS.. which I have done with intense inter-<lb/>
est and satisfaction, but under extremely unfavorable physical condi-<lb/>
tions, I have, of course, &ldquo;picked up&rdquo; some of the &ldquo;minor residual errors,&rdquo;<lb/>
which, as you wrote, can be corrected in the galley proof. The only one<lb/>
that seems (possibly) worth noting just now is the f. n. on page 117<lb/>
(sent me as a replacement a few days ago<del>.</del><add>)</add>. This foot note now reads:</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&ldquo;(1) B&eacute;ranger-F&eacute;raud (1890, p. 27) is of the opinion that there <hi>was</hi> yellow<lb/>
aboard ships in the Bight of Benin as early as 1520&rdquo;...</p>
<p>This should read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;(1) B&eacute;ranger-F&eacute;raud (1890, p. 27) is of the opinion that there <hi>may have</hi><lb/>
<hi>been</hi> yellow fever aboard ships&rdquo;.....</p>
<p>B-F&eacute;raud never mentioned the above as being his definite conviction.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The above, of course, can also wait for the galley proof, however as it<lb/>
seems to come within your category of &ldquo;corrections...probably not trans-<lb/>
cribed on the copy sent Colonel Russell&rdquo;...I send it for what it is worth.</p>
<p>I much appreciate your thoughtfulness in telling me that there<lb/>
is no need to rush myself in checking the over the Bibliography. It is<lb/>
a relief to know this, as I am still feeling very badly and find it hard<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fc0328043"/>
hard<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
to push things beyond a certain point. I am, none the less, extremely<lb/>
glad and most grateful to you and to Miss Frederick, for the getting the<lb/>
material over here in time for Miss Brown and myself to put in this week-<lb/>
end on it. This, because as I wrote you, the coming Sunday is one of the<lb/>
only two free ones she has a month. Surely, she too has entered into the<lb/>
spirit of the work on the book!</p>
<p>I must break this <unclear>off</unclear> or miss the last collection of mail.</p>

<salute>Hastily, but none the less, gratefully,<lb/>

P. S. Your table of Contents is <hi>&ldquo;a gem and a jewel</hi>! Since reading it,<lb/>
I am no longer concerned at the probable necessity of turning the indexing<lb/>
over to some good routine man, specializing in such work. By the way, I<lb/>
haven't read it all, as my carbon ends with Page ix, Chapter xiii, being<lb/>
the last one on that page, and the first chapter of the Section on Africa.<lb/>
