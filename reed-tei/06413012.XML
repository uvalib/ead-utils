<salute>My dear Colonel Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your note of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> came today and I<lb/>
have read with much interest your very<lb/>
tactful letters inclosed to Lambert and Dr. Brumby<lb/>
I think it was very wise for you not to quote me<lb/>
but to state as facts in your knowledge, those that<lb/>
disproved G. L's assertions. I think you have<lb/>
done a fine job - much better than any one<lb/>
else in my knowledge could have done.<lb/>
I am very grateful to you for the time and<lb/>
work you have put on these letters when you are<lb/>
over burdened with more important affairs.<lb/>
You will be sorry to know that our good and ac-<lb/>
complished friend Col. Joseph F. Siler is in Walter<lb/>
Reed Hospital and we have been very anxious about<lb/>
him. He had his prostate gland removed a week<lb/>
ago. I suppose it was cancer but have not heard<lb/>
it so stated. I hear that he is somewhat better<lb/>
this morning and hope that he may continue<lb/>
to improve. I am inclosing with this some old<lb/>
letters which I have come across in looking<lb/>
for other matters. The contents are not of special<lb/>
interest but the writers <del>were</del><add>are</add> notable men.<lb/>
It seems to me I heard you say once that you wanted<lb/>
a letter of Dr Carlos J. Finley's. Dr. Juan Guiteras was<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06413013"/>
<add><unclear>A</unclear>C</add><lb/>
<add>K</add><lb/>
also a very able and accomplished man and spoke<lb/>
both English and Spanish like the scholar that he<lb/>
was and with the most melodious voice I ever<lb/>
heard. I met him some years before the Spanish war<lb/>
when he was teaching pathology in Phila. and I<lb/>
was stationed at St. Augustine Fla. In Habana<lb/>
he was Secretary of the Yellow Fever Board of which Finlay<lb/>
and Gorgas were members and was in the second<lb/>
Intervention Director of the Hospital for contagious diseas-<lb/>
es (Las Animas).</p>
<p>We are well here except our old Cook Elizabeth who<lb/>
has given up her job. I dont think she is very sick<lb/>
but she is always very solicitous about her aches and<lb/>
pains. We are now just breaking in a successor who<lb/>
lives near by and is recommended by Elizabeth.</p>
<p>I am sure that you and Mrs Hench must have had<lb/>
a merry Christmas with your children about you.<lb/>
It takes children in the house to make a really<lb/>
merry Christmas. With cordial regards to Mrs<lb/>
Hench I am always</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your friend Sincerely</salute>
