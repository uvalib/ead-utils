<salute>My dear Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>In the &ldquo;Evening Post&rdquo; of October 24th, was an article<lb/>
headed, &ldquo;<hi>Fever Cases Concealed</hi>.&rdquo; In this article is, what appears to<lb/>
be a quotation from &ldquo;The Sun&rdquo;, which charges me with stating that<lb/>
last year the yellow fever record in Havana was concealed. The &ldquo;Even<lb/>
ing Post&rdquo; makes certain inferences which reflect upon General Brooke<lb/>
and General Ludlow, although the latter's name was not mentioned. I<lb/>
did not state directly or indirectly that the fever situation was<lb/>
concealed. I stated the fever situation last December, saying, that<lb/>
in December, 1899, there were more deaths in the civil population<lb/>
from yellow fever than in any December in ten years, and that the<lb/>
fever was with us throughout the winter. I stated also that at<lb/>
present the exact fever situation was given to the press for general<lb/>
publication daily, and that in 1899, this method of publication was<lb/>
not adopted. Statements then, I believe, were made monthly, and<lb/>
comparatively little was heard of yellow fever.</p>
<p>The purpose of my statement was to correct an impression which<lb/>
I found to be generally prevalent, namely, that yellow<lb/>

HEADQUARTERS<lb/>

HAVANA.<lb/>
-----<lb/>
(2)<lb/>
fever situation in Havana must be due to lack of proper sanitary<lb/>
precautions, and that it was in remarkable contrast with the con-<lb/>
ditions of last year, and in correcting this, I stated that the con-<lb/>
ditions of this year were due to the enormous number of Spanish<lb/>
immigrants pouring into Cuba through this Port; all of them food<lb/>
for fever.</p>
<p>I also stated that Havana was cleaner to-day then ever,<lb/>
inasmuch as the sanitary work inaugurated by General Ludlow is being<lb/>
pushed forward with the same degree of intelligence and energy,<lb/>
and under the same personnel as during his Governorship of the<lb/>
city, that the sanitary condition of the city was better than be-<lb/>
fore as shown by the total death rate from all causes, even includ-<lb/>
ing yellow fever.</p>
<p>There were nothing in my statements which could, direct-<lb/>
ly or indirectly, be taken as a charge that there was any conceal-<lb/>
ment of yellow fever last year. Such an inference is unfair to<lb/>
me and unjust to the Officers in charge at Havana. The mis-state-<lb/>
ments in this particular should be corrected.</p>
