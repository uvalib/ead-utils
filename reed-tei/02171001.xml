Pleasure<lb/>
no. 1.<lb/>
<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>When we<lb/>
pulled out from our dock in<lb/>
New York, a strong nor'wester<lb/>
was already blowing at a<lb/>
good rate- The sea soon<lb/>
became rough and topsy tur-<lb/>
vy, and then I knew that I<lb/>
was in for a <hi>real good time</hi>!<lb/>
I managed to eat a little bit<lb/>
of my dinner, at 5 o'clock and<lb/>
quickly thereafter tumbled into<lb/>
my berth, where needless to<lb/>
state I have been ever since<lb/>
one could hardly sleep at all<lb/>
Saturday night, the boat rolled<lb/>
from side to side so dreadfully.<lb/>
It was as much as one<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02171002"/>
could do to keep from tumb-<lb/>
ling out. This afternoon she<lb/>
still rolls, but not enough to<lb/>
give any trouble- I haven't<lb/>
been sick all the time by<lb/>
any means, but have had no<lb/>
appitite- Have managed to<lb/>
eat some fruit and now and<lb/>
then a cup of tea. But I<lb/>
don't relish any thing- The<lb/>
Captain, a fat jolly gentleman,<lb/>
has been in to see me<lb/>
twice and offered to do any<lb/>
thing in his power- I've told<lb/>
him that I thought the best<lb/>
thing to do was to keep in<lb/>
my berth and sleep as much<lb/>
as possible- I have only<lb/>
&ldquo;fed the fishes&rdquo; twice-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02171003"/>
I am lying flat of my back<lb/>
as I write with my paper<lb/>
propped up against my knees.<lb/>
It is rather uncomfortable and<lb/>
I am afraid that my wri-<lb/>
ting isn't very plain. Be-<lb/>
sides its just a wee-bit<lb/>
tiresome- I have thought<lb/>
a great deal about my<lb/>
two precious girls and how<lb/>
sweet they were to Papa<lb/>
while he was in Washington.<lb/>
And how sweet they were to<lb/>
each other too- Papa's <hi>big</hi> girl<lb/>
helping his <hi>little</hi> girl with<lb/>
her lessons so kindly! Nothing<lb/>
makes him so happy as to<lb/>
see his children getting along<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02171004"/>
sweetly together! Did the<lb/>
candy arrive from New York<lb/>
I couldn't go away, although<lb/>
it was so sloppy and wet, with<lb/>
out strolling down to 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> St.<lb/>
and getting something for my pre-<lb/>
cious girls.</p>
<p><hi>Pleasure no. 2</hi>.- Pleasure no. 1. was<lb/>
rather short, wasn't it, lovie, dear?<lb/>
I simply had to give up the attempt<lb/>
yesterday, (this is Tuesday afternoon)<lb/>
the position in which I was<lb/>
trying to write was so very<lb/>
irk some- Last night, I slept<lb/>
pretty well and when I awoke, was<lb/>
delighted to see the Florida<lb/>
Coast once more and to find that<lb/>
the Seas were quieter and the<lb/>
boat pitching less- After<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02171005"/>
2) After one or two attempts,<lb/>
I got up and bathed my face and<lb/>
then lay down &amp; waited for my<lb/>
breakfast of &ldquo;minched chicken&rdquo;<lb/>
&ldquo;on Toast&rdquo; and a cup of tea-<lb/>
To my surprise, I enjoyed them<lb/>
very much and even ordered<lb/>
a plate of cakes, which I ate<lb/>
with relish- After finishing<lb/>
my toilet, I went to the Barber<lb/>
shop &amp; got rid of a 3 days growth<lb/>
of beard and then felt better.<lb/>
My! but <hi>it is hot</hi>! we chance<lb/>
to be travelling with the breeze<lb/>
&amp; hence get none of it- I got on<lb/>
deck at 10 a.m. for the first time<lb/>
since we left N.Y. Enjoyed<lb/>
my lunch at 1 o'clock very<lb/>
much and am now taking in<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02171006"/>
the quiet beauty of the Florida<lb/>
Coast, while the busy ballot=<lb/>
tossers in the U.S. are, I hope,<lb/>
burying that big-mouth Bryan<lb/>
with a bank of paper! We<lb/>
will expect to hear something<lb/>
tomorrow morning when we reach<lb/>
Havana- My cold clings to me<lb/>
yet; that is I sneeze occasion-<lb/>
ally &amp; my head feels a little stuffy,<lb/>
but it don't bother me much-<lb/>
I am afraid that <hi>end</hi> seat<lb/>
of Miss Mason's table isn't<lb/>
conducive to good health -<lb/>
you &amp; fat love had better<lb/>
avoid it, and let somebody<lb/>
else sit there who is more<lb/>
resistant to temperature<lb/>
changes- It quite did me up-<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02171007"/>
9.30 P.M. While I had stopped writing<lb/>
for a moment, a nice looking<lb/>
gentleman drew his chair up a-<lb/>
long side of mine and began to<lb/>
remark on the beauty of the scene.<lb/>
He is a german, who lives at<lb/>
Vedado and speaks spanish fluently<lb/>
We chatted till dinner time, and<lb/>
after dinner till now, I have been<lb/>
revelling in the beautiful moon-<lb/>
light- Such a perfect night and<lb/>
so balmy and delicious the air<lb/>
as we approach the Cuban Coast-<lb/>
we can't be more than 50 miles<lb/>
away from Cuba now, &amp; when we<lb/>
awake at 6 a.m., the Mexico<lb/>
will be tugging at her anchor<lb/>
in Havana Harbor- I enjoyed<lb/>
my dinner, but will enjoy my meals<lb/>
more when I get ashore. I<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02171008"/>
will leave the balance of this page<lb/>
for a few words after we arrive-<lb/>
Good-night, you sweet hearts and<lb/>
may your dreams be bright and happy<lb/>
<hi>Wednesday</hi> 6 a.m. Here we<lb/>
are in Havana Harbor<lb/>
&amp; almost ready to land.<lb/>
The morning is bright and<lb/>
beautiful and I am feeling<lb/>
quite jolly to think that<lb/>
the boat is, at last, at<lb/>
anchor &amp; quiet.</p>
<p>Have just reached the<lb/>
Post Office in Dr Agra-<lb/>
monte's carriage- Love<lb/>
&amp; kisses for my sweet,<lb/>
sweet girls-</p>
