<unclear>Sir</unclear><lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Kelley:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Referring to our conversation of<lb/>
Friday evening with regard to my old friend James<lb/>
Carroll, I would say that I arrived at Fort Custer,<lb/>
Mont., in the latter part of January 1884, almost at<lb/>
the beginning of my own military service, and found<lb/>
at the post hospital as Senior Hospital Steward a man<lb/>
of about my own age in the person of James Carroll.<lb/>
Carroll was at that time in appearance almost exactly<lb/>
what he was when I last saw him about a year before<lb/>
his death, for the years had apparently touched him<lb/>
lightly up to almost the very last. We became very<lb/>
friendly for I recognized in him qualities far above<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02960008"/>
those found in the ordinary enlisted man, and at his<lb/>
request I undertook to start him upon the study of<lb/>
medicine. The picture of the first lesson as we sat<lb/>
in the surgeon's office in the hospital at Fort Custer,<lb/>
discussing the occipital bone, is indelibly impressed<lb/>
upon my memory; it was Carroll's first step in the<lb/>
real study of medicine. Several months later he took<lb/>
a long furlough with the purpose of proceeding to New<lb/>
York and attending lectures--as we used to say in<lb/>
those days--at a medical college. During that period<lb/>
we corresponded and I was much pleased to see, upon<lb/>
receipt of the college catalogue, in which his name<lb/>
appeared, that he claimed me as his preceptor. I con-<lb/>
tinued my interest in him and, as I told you Friday<lb/>
evening, obtained for him a few years later, when he<lb/>
had acquired the degree of M. D., a station at which,<lb/>
although still an enlisted man, he would have been<lb/>
practically Post Surgeon of one of the New York Harbor<lb/>
posts--a post of which I was nominally surgeon, al-<lb/>
though I resided upon another Island and in another<lb/>
garrison. This however he declined in order to re-<lb/>
main in Baltimore and prosecute his pathological<lb/>

-2-<lb/>
studies, so that it was not until the Spanish-American<lb/>
War that I met him again. We met frequently after<lb/>
that however, and I have in my possession a letter from<lb/>
him, written in 1902 I think, after he had been commis-<lb/>
sioned as a medical officer, in which he stated with<lb/>
the exaggeration born of profound, although perhaps<lb/>
undeserved appreciation, that all he had done he owed<lb/>
to me.</p>
<p>This briefly is the story of the relations of<lb/>
Carroll and myself, very baldly stated of course, for<lb/>
there are many details both of character and incident<lb/>
which I might give to illustrate the situation, but I<lb/>
presume that the facts which I have mentioned will cov-<lb/>
er the ground which you wish. In case anything else<lb/>
should be desired or I can be of any further service<lb/>
I trust you will command me.</p>
