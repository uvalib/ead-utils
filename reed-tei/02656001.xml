<p>Walter Reed Memorial Association,<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>Extract from the Report of the Secretary of War, 1901.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The control of yellow fever, acting upon the results of<lb/>
investigations as to its causes, prosecuted under the direc-<lb/>
tion of the Military Government, appears to be now practi-<lb/>
cally absolute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Surgeon-General of the Army furnishes the following<lb/>
condensed statement concerning the investigation and its<lb/>
result:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The importance and far-reaching consequences of the<lb/>
observations made by Major Reed and his associates at Que-<lb/>
mados, Cuba, can hardly be overestimated. For the first<lb/>
time in the history of this widely prevalent tropical disease<lb/>
we are in possession of knowledge in regard to the manner<lb/>
of its propagation which will enable us, I believe, not only<lb/>
to check its ravages, but to effectually stamp it out whenever<lb/>
it may appear in any of our garrisons or cities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>From the Report of the Secretary of War, 1902.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brilliant character of this scientific achievement, its<lb/>
inestimable value to mankind, the saving of thousands of<lb/>
lives, and the deliverance of the Atlantic Sea Coast from<lb/>
constant apprehension, demand special recognition from the<lb/>
Government of the United States.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed is the ranking Major in the Medical Department,<lb/>
and within a few months will, by operation of law, become<lb/>
Lieutenant-Colonel. I ask that the President be authorised<lb/>
to appoint him Assistant Surgeon-General with the rank of<lb/>
Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="2" id="f02656002"/>
<p>2</p>
<p>From Maj.-Gen. Leonard Wood's address at a memorial meet-<lb/>
ing of scientific men in Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of no other man on this side of the world who<lb/>
has done so much for humanity as Dr. Reed. His discovery<lb/>
results in the saving of more lives annually than were lost in<lb/>
the Cuban war, and saves the commercial interests of the<lb/>
world a greater financial loss each year than the cost of the<lb/>
Cuban war. He came to Cuba at a time when one-third of<lb/>
the officers of my staff died of yellow fever, and we were dis-<lb/>
couraged at the failure of our efforts to control the disease.</p>
<p>In the months when the disease was ordinarily worst the<lb/>
disease was checked and driven from Habana. That was<lb/>
the first time in nearly two hundred years that the city had<lb/>
been rid of it. The value of his discovery cannot be appre-<lb/>
ciated by persons who are not familiar with the conditions<lb/>
of tropical countries. Hereafter it will never be possible for<lb/>
yellow fever to gain such headway that quarantine will exist<lb/>
from the mouth of the Potomac to the mouth of the Rio<lb/>
Grande. Future generations will appreciate fully the value<lb/>
of Dr. Reed's services. His was the originating, directing,<lb/>
and controlling mind in this work, and the others were assis-<lb/>
tants only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>Extract from a letter of Gen. Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Major Reed belongs the honor of having led in the<lb/>
greatest medical work of modern times, and the results he<lb/>
accomplished will live for all time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>Extract from a letter of Prof. Wm. Welch, of Johns Hop-<lb/>
kins University to the Secretary of War.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Reed's researches in yellow fever are by far the most<lb/>
important contributions to science which have ever come<lb/>
from any Army surgeon. In my judgment they are the most<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02656003"/>
3<lb/>
valuable contributions to medicine and public hygiene<lb/>
which have ever been made in this country with the except-<lb/>
tion of the discovery of an&aelig;sthesia. They have led and<lb/>
will lead to the saving of thousands of lives. I am in a<lb/>
position to know that the credit for the original ideas em-<lb/>
bodied in this work belongs wholly to Major Reed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>When conferring the degree of M. A., President Eliot, of<lb/>
Harvard University, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter Reed, graduate of medicine of the University of<lb/>
Virginia, the Army surgeon who planned and directed in<lb/>
Cuba the experiments which have given man control over<lb/>
that fearful scourge, yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>From an editorial in American Medicine (referring to<lb/>
Major Reed).</p>
<p>&ldquo;His was the master mind and he the guiding spirit in<lb/>
and investigation whereby multitudes of lives have been<lb/>
saved, a pestilential malady robbed of its mysteries and<lb/>
terrors, and an annual expenditure of millions of money<lb/>
shown to be in large part, if not entirely, needless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>From the Resolution adopted by the Medical Faculty of<lb/>
the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His masterly investigation of the causes of the out-<lb/>
breaks of typhoid fever in the U. S. Army during the Spanish-<lb/>
American War, and especially his work furnishing conclusive<lb/>
proof of the conveyance of yellow fever by the mosquito,<lb/>
entitle him to a pre-eminent place amongst scientists and<lb/>
sanitarians and will prove of inestimable service to mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="4" id="f02656004"/>
<p>4</p>
<p>From the Resolutions of the American Association for the<lb/>
Advancement of Science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By solving the problem of the mode of spread of yellow<lb/>
fever, Major Reed not only made a great contribution to<lb/>
science, but at the same time conferred inestimable benefits<lb/>
upon his country and upon mankind. To have discovered<lb/>
and demonstrated the methods, which have already been<lb/>
successfully tested in Cuba, of eradicating a widespread and<lb/>
terrible pestilence, is a benefaction of imperishable renown,<lb/>
of incalculable value in the saving of human lives, of vast<lb/>
importance to commercial interests, and deserving the highest<lb/>
rewards in the power of his countrymen to bestow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>From Resolutions of the Medical Society of the District of<lb/>
Columbia, December 3, 1902.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His greatest achievement for science and humanity was<lb/>
his contribution to the cause, spread, and prevention of<lb/>
yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The practical value of this discovery, which in point of<lb/>
importance and far-reaching beneficence ranks only second<lb/>
with Jenner's discovery of vaccination, has been proved by<lb/>
the complete eradication of this scourge from Havana."</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>From Resolutions of the American Medical Association,<lb/>
June 11, 1902.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The members of the American Medical Association be-<lb/>
lieve that the recent work of the U. S. Army surgeon in<lb/>
Cuba in relation to the discovery of the method of trans-<lb/>
mission of yellow fever is of such magnitude and far-reach-<lb/>
ing beneficence as to rank only second with Jenner's discov-<lb/>
ery of vaccination.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="5" id="f02656005"/>
<p>5</p>
<p>From Lecture of Sir Patrick Manson, M. D., Medical<lb/>
Adviser of the British Colonial Office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Walter Reed did a great and beneficent work. We<lb/>
in England thoroughly appreciate this, and heartily sympa-<lb/>
thize with America in the loss she and the world has sus-<lb/>
tained by his premature death. The best tribute we can<lb/>
pay to his memory is at once to apply his discovery. Let<lb/>
us hope that the good he has done will not be interred with<lb/>
his bones, and that his countrymen and the rest of us will<lb/>
take care to push forward the great and beneficent measures<lb/>
his brilliant labors so clearly indicate.&rdquo;</p>

Medicine at Cairo, Egypt, December 22, 1902.</p>
<p>Les membres du Premier Congres de M&eacute;decine en &Eacute;gypte<lb/>

<p>Extracts from paper by Major Reed and Dr. Carroll, U. S.<lb/>
Army, entitled &ldquo;The Prevention of Yellow Fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we confine ourselves to the epidemics which have<lb/>
occurred since 1793, we find that there have not been less<lb/>
than 100,000 deaths from this cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we reckon the average mortality at 20 per cent, there<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02656006"/>
6<lb/>
have not been less than 500,000 cases of yellow fever in the<lb/>
United States during the period from 1793 to 1900.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the sixth annual meeting of the Public Health Asso-<lb/>
ciation held in Richmond, Va. in 1878, Dr. Samuel Chop-<lb/>
pin, President of the State Board of Health of Louisiana,<lb/>
estimated the actual cost of the epidemic of that year to the<lb/>
material resources of the city of New Orleans at $10-<lb/>
752,500.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>In addressing President McKinley, the Chairman of the<lb/>
Committee of the Public Health Association, 1897<lb/>
(Dr. Horlbeck, of Charleston, S. C.), said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hardly necessary to call your attention to the <unclear>seri-<lb/>
ous</unclear> results of the recent epidemic of yellow fever in the<lb/>
States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, but we may<lb/>
be permitted to mention the fact that the great epidemic of<lb/>
1878 resulted in the loss of nearly 16,000 lives, and that it<lb/>
has been estimated that the total loss to the country result-<lb/>
ing from this epidemic was not less than $100,000,000.</p>
