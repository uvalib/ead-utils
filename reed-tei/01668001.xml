<salute>My own, dear Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter<lb/>
of the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <unclear>Inst.</unclear> has just been re-<lb/>
ceived &amp; I delay not a moment<lb/>
in answering. I wrote you a let-<lb/>
ter, this morning, when I was feel-<lb/>
ing very sad &amp; gloomy, and I<lb/>
wish so much that I had it<lb/>
in my possession again, that<lb/>
I might destroy it &amp; write a<lb/>
more cheerful one. One sen-<lb/>
tence in it, I believe, was to the<lb/>
effect that I would make no<lb/>
promises in the Future; and<lb/>
at the time I wrote so sad<lb/>
was I feeling over the fact<lb/>
of having written harshly to<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01668002"/>
<hi>you</hi>, my precious E, that I felt as if I had no<lb/>
confidence in myself. But, to-night, thank Heaven<lb/>
I have shaken off the gloom somewhat and I<lb/>
would not write in so sad a strain as I<lb/>
did, this morning- Oh! my sweet, my darling Emilie,<lb/>
I hasten to offer you <hi>my sincerest sympathy</hi><lb/>
in this your time of distress, and I pray that<lb/>
The Good Being will watch over you &amp; yours &amp;<lb/>
soon restore you to perfect health- How<lb/>
I long to be with you, if, perchance, I might<lb/>
be able to supply your slightest want- So<lb/>
that I could speak some cheering word<lb/>
to you. Oh! my own, darling E. I am so<lb/>
uneasy about you- I am so afraid<lb/>
that e're you are strong enough, <del>that</del> you<lb/>
will exert yourself in assisting to nurse the<lb/>
poor little suffering boy- Would that I were<lb/>
present to take some of the burden off<lb/>
your hands! Please extend to your sister my<lb/>
most sincere &amp; heartfelt sympathy for her in<lb/>
this affliction &amp; tell her that I earnestly hope<lb/>
that her little boy is already out of danger-<lb/>
I will not forget to send up a prayer to<lb/>
Heaven for his recovery &amp; restoration to <del>health</del><lb/>
her love- If you are nursing him, my darling,<lb/>
be sure to spend a part of your time in the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01668003"/>
open air, for as the disease (Typhoid Fever) is<lb/>
slightly contagious, you might contract it if you<lb/>
remained too constantly at his bed-side. Take<lb/>
every precaution with your health, my darling,<lb/>
&amp; should you be prostrated with the same illness,<lb/>
do not lose a moment in notifying me of the<lb/>
same &amp; I will be at your side as soon <add>as</add><lb/>
time will permit me. I will write to you<lb/>
often &amp; will be satisfied with only a word<lb/>
from you- just enough to inform <add>me</add> of your health-<lb/>
I would not have you over-exert yourself by writing, for<lb/>
<hi>all the world</hi>!<lb/>
Good Night, my sweet, my precious, my <hi>love</hi>, my <hi>all-<lb/>
my own dear Emilie</hi>-</p>
