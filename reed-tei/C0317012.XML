<salute>Dear Miss Read:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am enclosing herewith a brief Memorandum of two conferences<lb/>
I have had within the past few weeks, with Dr. Sylvanus Griswold Morley<lb/>
of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, in regard to that part of<lb/>
of the History of Yellow Fever embraced in Section 111: Part 1 and Part<lb/>
1 Continued.</p>
<p>I am very enthusiastic about what has been accomplished, both<lb/>
in regard to the material selected and in the promptitude with which<lb/>
Dr. Morley has gotten the actual work of its preparation for the book<lb/>
under way. I think we now have just what we need pictorially to round<lb/>
out this section from a geographic and archaeological standpoint.</p>
<p>By the way, I have mislaid the expense account book that Dr.<lb/>
Russell gave me in October 1925. May I have another? My expenses<lb/>
heretofore, in connection with the His<del><unclear>ot</unclear></del><add>to</add>ry of Yellow Fever (typewriting<lb/>
supplies: note books etc. etc.) have been so small that I really did<lb/>
not feel justified in sending them in: while the tracings from the three<lb/>
Nahuatl Codices (mentioned in the enclosed Mem.) I paid for myself, be-<lb/>
cause you have all been so beautifully kind when I have had to &ldquo;slow up&rdquo;<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0317013"/>
&ldquo;slow up&rdquo;<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
on the book (notably <add>from</add> the ptomaine poisoning <del>of</del> last spring).</p>
<p>Now, however, I've had to make the two trips to Washington (one<lb/>
involving a stay of two days) and there will be other expenses (retyping<lb/>
MSS: map outlines etc) in the comparatively near future.</p>
<p>In this connection, how do I handle things of this kind? Pay<lb/>
the bills myself and send in the receipts with my expense book?</p>
<p>I know you will be glad to hear that I was able to turn over<add>,</add><lb/>
to Dr. Frost<add>,</add> the rough copy of the revised MSS of Section 1 (Epidemio-<lb/>
logy) a couple of weeks ago. It was the hardest piece of work connected<lb/>
with the book (transcribing <add>a mass</add> Father's final notes (almost microscopic in<lb/>
the chirography and <add>also</add> in a sort of code of his own, which no one but he<lb/>
and myself could read: Indeed, he didn't intend them to be read--just<lb/>
jotted them down to dictate to me later). Frost considers them very<lb/>
valuable, however--adding much to the interest of the book, The MSS<lb/>
has been cut, where<del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del><add>v</add>er they were to be inserted and they have been <hi>pasted<lb/>
in</hi>--rather than pinned--so as to avoid any mistake in retyping. Dr.<lb/>
Russell has wisely suggested that this retyping should be done twice and<lb/>
I shall shall have the first copy started as soon as Dr. Frost returns<lb/>
the MSS. of this Section.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is an abundance to be done on the rest of<lb/>
the book, so that there is no delay involved in any case.</p>

Very truly yours,</salute>
