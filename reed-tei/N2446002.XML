<p>The Mosquito and the Frost.</p>
<p>While the Mobile (Ala.) Register pro-<lb/>
tests against a too hasty acceptance of<lb/>
the theory that yellow fever is communi-<lb/>
cated only through the medium of a mos-<lb/>
quito bite, one Dr. James J. Walsh, writ-<lb/>
ing in the New York Journal, is assuring<lb/>
all creation--such being the size of the<lb/>
Journal's circulation--that the theory is<lb/>
without a flaw. The Register is published<lb/>
in a town which up to 1880 had intimate<lb/>
knowledge of yellow fever for nearly if<lb/>
not quite half a century. Dr. Walsh is a<lb/>
gentleman who, if we may base a judg-<lb/>
ment upon his utterances, has never seen<lb/>
half a dozen cases in all his professional<lb/>
career.</p>
<p>To illustrate: The Mobile Register says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most that can be said of the theory is<lb/>
that it is possibly a true one. No exhaustive ex-<lb/>
periment has been made--no experiment so thor-<lb/>
ough as to demonstrate that the mosquito does<lb/>
carry the infection, or that the mosquito is the<lb/>
only carrier of the infection. We have taken the<lb/>
trouble to examine the evidence, and can say with<lb/>
assurance of speaking the truth that the experi-<lb/>
ments do not prove anything whatever, except the<lb/>
possibility that yellow fever is carried by the<lb/>
insect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Dr. Walsh speaks<lb/>
with all the confidence of an established<lb/>
oracle:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yellow fever is distinctly a warm-weather dis-<lb/>
ease. It always disappears with cold weather. In<lb/>
this it is the exact contrary of smallpox, which<lb/>
flourishes most virulently during continuous cold<lb/>
weather. The first frost was always the signal<lb/>
for the cessation of yellow fever in a locality, no<lb/>
matter with what virulence the disease had been<lb/>
raging beforehand. Malaria also disappears with<lb/>
frost. We know now that the reason for this is<lb/>
that the mosquito settles down into winter quar-<lb/>
ters and no longer goes campaigning when cold<lb/>
weather sets in. The new theory as to yellow<lb/>
fever will explain its disappearance with the<lb/>
frost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a fact, however, and one suscepti-<lb/>
ble of easy demonstration, that &ldquo;the first<lb/>
frost&rdquo; is not and never has been &ldquo;the sig-<lb/>
nal for the cessation of yellow fever.&rdquo; It<lb/>
is equally a fact that the mosquito does<lb/>
not &ldquo;settle down into winter quarters and<lb/>
no longer goes campaigning when cold<lb/>
weather sets in.&rdquo; Both these propositions<lb/>
are ridiculously untenable. Everybody<lb/>
who has had the slightest experience of<lb/>
yellow fever in such cities as New Or-<lb/>
leans, Mobile, Pensacola, &amp;c., knows that<lb/>
the &ldquo;first frost&rdquo; has no effect upon yel-<lb/>
low fever, except to quadruple the peril<lb/>
of those who are its victims at the time.<lb/>
The infection does not continue to<lb/>
spread--indeed, it begins to contract--af-<lb/>
ter the appearance of cold weather, but it<lb/>
does not vanish, as Dr. Walsh fondly<lb/>
imagines. On the contrary, during the<lb/>
great epidemic of 1878 in New Orleans it<lb/>
survived a dozen frosts, and there is an<lb/>
authenticated case of a servant in the<lb/>
residence of Col. John B. Lafitte, of that<lb/>
city, who died December 26, having con-<lb/>
tracted the disease on the 22d--after sev-<lb/>
eral occurrences, not of frost, but of<lb/>
freezing temperature. Nor is it true that<lb/>
the New Orleans mosquito goes into win-<lb/>
ter quarters and ceases campaigning<lb/>
when the cold sets in. No matter how low<lb/>
the mercury may fall outside, one has<lb/>
only to warm his room to the point of<lb/>
comfort in order to restore the little gray<lb/>
house mosquito to regular midsummer<lb/>
activity.</p>
<p>We quite agree with the esteemed Reg-<lb/>
ister that the apostles of the new yellow<lb/>
fever gospel have still much to prove if<lb/>
they would greatly swell the number of<lb/>
its followers. It is a fact, however, that<lb/>
we devoutly wish things were as they be-<lb/>
lieve. What a blessing it would be to see<lb/>
the last of the barbarous inland quaran-<lb/>
tine machinery--including the shotgun<lb/>
and the railroad wrecker--and to hail as<lb/>
its successor the harmless mosquito net<lb/>
by night and the evil-smelling anoint-<lb/>
ment by day!</p>
