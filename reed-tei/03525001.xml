<salute>My dear <hi>Hutch:</hi></salute>
</opener>
<p>I am delighted that my preliminary suggestions appeal to you. I made<lb/>
discreet inquiries, and Dr. Wilson, Emeritus Director of the Mayo Foundation,<lb/>
knows of Dr. Henry K. Mohler, but does not know about his speaking ability. However,<lb/>
my first assistant was one of his students at Jefferson, and just between you and me,<lb/>
he gave me the following summary: he said that he was just another good doctor who<lb/>
had played around with the right crowd, and had played medical politics with sufficient<lb/>
success to earn this job as the Dean. He called him an average speaker, and said, &ldquo;I<lb/>
wouldn't pick him to entertain me, or any other crowd of people.&rdquo; However, that is<lb/>
neither here nor there, if you are inviting him for some ulterior motive regarding<lb/>
the stolen picture. It all goes to show that one gets invited to do things not always<lb/>
for the same reason:</p>
<p>If you decide on Dr. Sawyer, I would suggest that you try to get after him<lb/>
pretty early. I understand that he travels all over North and South America, and<lb/>
naturally you would want to date him up pretty long ahead of time.</p>
<p>I shall go ahead with my plans for the informal talk, thinking of you and<lb/>
planning for your affair, but I will not be worried in the very slightest iota should<lb/>
you decide to change your plans. I want to see Moran anyhow. He is in Havana, and<lb/>
Mary and I will run over there from Florida when we go there in March. I hope to<lb/>
ramble around the old site of the camp and will get some movies of Moran as he now<lb/>
is and of the camp as it now looks, etc. Moran is the O'Hara of the Saturday Evening<lb/>
Post story. I saw that story at once and have it in my files. I have many letters<lb/>
from him. He is connected with the Sunoco Oil Co. but is getting along in years and<lb/>
has a bad ulcer of the stomach. Would you want me to write to him about the possi-<lb/>
bility of coming up for Founders' Day? Perhaps, if you are not in too much of a hurry,<lb/>
it would be better for me to discuss it with him tangentially when I see him. He<lb/>
doesn't seem to get to America very often, but it is quite possible that if I were<lb/>
armed with a nice letter from you (not promising him much, but nevertheless inviting<lb/>
him) that he would be glad to come.</p>
<p>I am delighted that you thought well of my suggestion to send you the<lb/>
illustrated London News. I think you will enjoy it, and I have put in the subscription<lb/>
for it. We had a very happy Christmas and New Years.</p>
<p>We are still looking forward to a visit from you at any time you can come.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
