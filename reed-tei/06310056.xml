General Albert E. Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco, California<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Because of the war, my plans have been somewhat changed.<lb/>
I am already losing my First Assistant to the army and because so many of our<lb/>
Fellows are leaving, I am having a little trouble in getting new assistants.<lb/>
The American College of Physicians has asked me to conduct a week's post-graduate<lb/>
course for physicians from all over the country. This course on rheumatic diseases<lb/>
will be given here in our department the second week in April, beginning the 13th<lb/>
of April. On the 21st of April I am chairman of a round table conference at the<lb/>
national meeting of the American College of Physicians in St. Paul. Thereafter<lb/>
I will be free to start my vacation. I had hoped to come to California either<lb/>
leaving here the last week in April (about the 24th) or the first week in May.<lb/>
I am sorry indeed to hear that you may not be in California then. If so, I may<lb/>
change my plans or not come at all. I had hoped, of vourse, to see Mrs. Lazear<lb/>
but if you are not there I should be greatly disappointed. It is of course not<lb/>
right for me to change any plans of yourself but as soon as you know whether you<lb/>
will be in California the first week in May or the last week in April, I should<lb/>
greatly appreciate hearing as this will revise my entire vacation plans.</p>
<p>Perchance you might be coming through Chicago. If you could<lb/>
break your trip and spend a day there I should be almost tempted to come down and<lb/>
meet you there, bringing a certain amount of material with me. Even better yet,<lb/>
why not break it by stopping here for a couple of days? You really ought to see the<lb/>
Mayo Clinic anyhow and I would knock off a couple of days from routine work in order<lb/>
to be with you all the time, as host and guide. I believe you would find that there<lb/>
are special rates here to take the extra trip through Rochester. You can come<lb/>
straight here from Kansas City or Omaha and then go to Chicago on the Chicago North-<lb/>
western. Since this is a medical center and so-called sanitarium, I believe it will<lb/>
only cost you a very few dollars, perhaps less than five, to stop here. Will your<lb/>
family be coming with you? If so, we should be delighted to have them also.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that your manuscript will be published shortly.<lb/>
Do you know where you are publishing it?</p>
<p>The writing in the New York Academy of Medicine notebook is<lb/>
99 per cent identified. About 55 per cent is in the handwriting of Lazear (recognized<lb/>
and identified by Mrs. Lazear), about 44 per cent is in Reed's handwriting (recognized<lb/>
and identified by his children), only two or three pages remain unidentified. They may<lb/>
indeed be Neate's.</p>

<salute>Always sincerely,</salute>
