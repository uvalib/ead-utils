<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Last Monday<lb/>
morning the Postman told us<lb/>
that beginning with the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of<lb/>
July, we would only receive<lb/>
<hi>3</hi> mails per week instead<lb/>
of <hi>5</hi> as heretofore- These<lb/>
three mails will arrive Monday<del>s</del>,<lb/>
Wednesday &amp; Saturday and leave<lb/>
on the same days- I wrote to<lb/>
my darling wifie early on Wed=<lb/>
nesday morning, July 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, and mailed<lb/>
it in time for the Postman-<lb/>
The same day I got a sweet letter<lb/>
from my sweet Farmer-lady.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02054002"/>
Thursday we were so busily at<lb/>
work all day trying to arrange<lb/>
our laboratory &amp; other things<lb/>
for future work, that I didn't<lb/>
write and yesterday we rode into<lb/>
Havana, and when I got back<lb/>
I felt so tired after dinner, that<lb/>
I went to bed early- These<lb/>
are therefore the only <hi>two</hi> days<lb/>
since I left, that I haven't written<lb/>
to my precious children- My letters<lb/>
wouldn't have gone until, this<lb/>
morning, Saturday- I will hereafter<lb/>
write early on Monday, Wednesday<lb/>
&amp; Saturday- I don't know on what<lb/>
days to tell you, lovie, dear, to<lb/>
write so that your letters will reach<lb/>
me soonest, but if you wrote<lb/>
<hi>every day</hi> or have precious plump<lb/>
piano-player fill in the days<lb/>
I should be very happy with<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02054003"/>
the arrangement. The Boats leave<lb/>
Tampa on Monday, Thursday and<lb/>
Saturday- Don't bother your darling<lb/>
head about it, as I will get them<lb/>
on the next Boat, if your letters<lb/>
happen to miss one- I am so glad<lb/>
that my letter written on the boat<lb/>
didn't go astray- I wanted you &amp;<lb/>
precious joy to know how much I had<lb/>
really enjoyed the journey- As for<lb/>
Heat &amp; mosquitoes, sweet heart,<lb/>
the latter are here in some numbers<lb/>
but not enough to bother me, &amp;<lb/>
the former is much less trying<lb/>
than in Washington. For two days<lb/>
it has been warmer, but not warm<lb/>
enough to bother me at all- I have<lb/>
a good Chinaman for a laundryman<lb/>
&amp; can change as often as I please-<lb/>
my clothes are, also, thinner than I have<lb/>
ever worn- I got yesterday in Havana<lb/>
a large Cork Helmet, <add>with</add> which I<lb/>
propose to decorate my upper story<lb/>
when I go in the Sun. I was amused<lb/>
at Mrs. Roach's desire to have half of<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02054004"/>
the rails- I had already spoken to<lb/>
Dr Roach about it &amp; had told Mr Moore<lb/>
where to put them- Of course, she won't<lb/>
have <hi>but half</hi>- I wan't the <hi>other</hi> half<lb/>
<hi>myself</hi>!- Boo! Boo! If there are still<lb/>
stone left that can be used, let<lb/>
Mr Moore continue on down the road<lb/>
till he strikes the fence Mr Flohr has<lb/>
built- Ask Johnnie Moore what he<lb/>
thinks of it: Now is a<add>s</add> good <add>a</add> time as<lb/>
any for building the fence: or let him<lb/>
clear the rocks from my precious wifie's<lb/>
park &amp; build that little piece of fence,<lb/>
<hi>Saving one half the rails</hi>! I could<lb/>
just see Mrs. Farmer-lady when<lb/>
that hard western breeze was<lb/>
blowing! Why didn't you get into<lb/>
the cellar? Certainly nothing could<lb/>
be more disagreeable than those<lb/>
everlasting western blows- They<lb/>
are apt to occur in July. I think-<lb/>
you musn't really get discouraged<lb/>
about those astors &amp; c- Put some<lb/>
more bone meal around them<lb/>
&amp; <hi>make them grow</hi>! Take them<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02054005"/>
by the tops &amp; <hi>pull them up</hi> until<lb/>
they are <hi>real tall</hi>! Am so glad<lb/>
that you will soon have veg-<lb/>
etables- I know that my darling<lb/>
wifie and my sweet baby will<lb/>
enjoy them so much- Of course,<lb/>
you musn't expect to have as<lb/>
good a garden the first year<lb/>
after upturning the soil, but<lb/>
it will improve each year.<lb/>
I don't understand the first<lb/>
corn &amp; still think that you<lb/>
must be mistaken in saying<lb/>
that it won't amount to anything.<lb/>
Have Jacob work it &amp; the other<lb/>
corn every week &amp; I am cer-<lb/>
tain that it will do well-<lb/>
But don't bother yourself &amp;<lb/>
work too hard over the<lb/>
<unclear>sann</unclear>, my precious heart --<lb/>
you might make yourself<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02054006"/>
sick- Why don't my precious<lb/>
love daughter write to her father<lb/>
more frequently? She musn't<lb/>
play with that pup &amp; the<lb/>
piano <hi>all</hi> the time! Are<lb/>
<unclear>Pud</unclear> &amp; Miss Beals large enough<lb/>
to eat? They ought to be good<lb/>
on toast a few weeks from<lb/>
now- When is Lucy coming<lb/>
up? I suppose that Fat auntie<lb/>
has, at last, arrived- Give<lb/>
her much love for me and<lb/>
also to the girls- How is she<lb/>
pleased with her new well?<lb/>
Well, I must stop- The morn-<lb/>
ing is cool and the sea beautiful.<lb/>
Take care of your darling selves,<lb/>
Love &amp; kisses for my precious<lb/>
sweet children- Darboy will<lb/>
be out tomorrow -- write<lb/>
often- Regards to Johnnie Moore &amp; Jacob</p>
