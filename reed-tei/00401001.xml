<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was so glad to<lb/>
get your letter, and I fear I have<lb/>
not been as prompt in writing as<lb/>
I ought to have been. But I have had<lb/>
some interuptions. As my son and<lb/>
family were with me for nearly<lb/>
two weeks, and have just left for<lb/>
This Country -- except Fred who is still<lb/>
here. I moved my desk into the<lb/>
Baby s room, and whenever I was<lb/>
ready to write she was always asleep<lb/>
The little garments for Margaret,<lb/>
this box for Houston, and the pin<lb/>
cushion came safely. Mabel was<lb/>
very much pleased, with them,<lb/>
This little dresses are lovely for<lb/>
baby- Mabel wishes me to thank<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00401002"/>
you very much for them all.<lb/>
I often think I will at once<lb/>
jot down Houston s cute sayings,<lb/>
<del>at once</del>. that I may write them to<lb/>
you. The other morning as Mabel<lb/>
changed his night gown&rdquo; he said<lb/>
<unclear>gannie</unclear> made this blue nighty<lb/>
for me and when she comes to<lb/>
my house, I will say &ldquo;Baltimore<lb/>
Ganny&rdquo;. Tonight as he was about<lb/>
to be put to bed he piled all the<lb/>
toys he has in his crib till there<lb/>
was no room left-</p>
<p>Mabel took him up to Anne Fields<lb/>
to luncheon the other day, and he<lb/>
had such a fine time that he stand<lb/>
till five o'clock, this is the first<lb/>
time he has been out to lunch.<lb/>
The baby has fourteen teeth all told<lb/>
now, she does not pretend to creep<lb/>
now, but walks every where-</p>
<p>I received a letter from Frances<lb/>
giving me an account of her visit<lb/>
with Nellie. I was very much<lb/>
interested in her letter.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00401003"/>
<p>Mabel has had a very nice letter<lb/>
from President Gilman, one from<lb/>
Dr Hurd, and from Dr Paton.<lb/>
He wrote this article in the Boston<lb/>
Transcript was written by President<lb/>
Elliot. of Harvard, in regard to the<lb/>
memorial for Jesse. We are so anxious<lb/>
to see this paper. Dr Paton said he<lb/>
would send a copy to Mabel-<lb/>
Jennie first wrote us about it.<lb/>
She said she felt so interested<lb/>
she wanted to give all her Christmas<lb/>
money towards it. But Walter told<lb/>
her he would gladly contribute for<lb/>
her- Mabel is still engaged with<lb/>
writing business letters-</p>
<p>We are certainly having an open<lb/>
Winter. We have had no rain to speak<lb/>
of since you left here- And the<lb/>
farmers are looking anxiously for<lb/>
rain- I was very much pleased<lb/>
with this pretty collar Mrs Seth send<lb/>
me &amp; thought it very sweet of<lb/>
her to remember me-</p>
<pb n="4" id="f00401004"/>
<p>Did I write you we have not<lb/>
seen this Murrays but once since<lb/>
you went away they called one<lb/>
evening they wished me to give<lb/>
their love to you-</p>
<p>It just happens that we have not had<lb/>
an opportunity to call upon them<lb/>
much to our regret.</p>
<p>This must be all this time with<lb/>
love and best wishes to you<lb/>
my dear friend.</p>
