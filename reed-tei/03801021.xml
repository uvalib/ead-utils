Dr. Henry E. Sigerist<lb/>
Johns Hopkins University<lb/>
Institute of the History of Medicine<lb/>
1900 East Monument Street<lb/>
Baltimore, Maryland<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Sigerist:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciated your letter of a couple of weeks ago, offering<lb/>
the pages of your Bulletin of the History of Medicine to my paper on yellow fever,<lb/>
and the reason I have not written you sooner is that I have been trying to decide<lb/>
in my own mind how to answer your gracious letter.</p>
<p>By separate post, I am sending you a brochure which includes an<lb/>
abstract of a talk which I gave at the dedication of the Lazear Memorial Building<lb/>
at Washington and Jefferson College. I did not know they were publishing this<lb/>
talk as they specifically said they were not, and that I could use it, as I pre-<lb/>
ferred to do, for publication in a medical journal. I did not see proof; hence,<lb/>
the two or three errors.</p>
<p>I have spent three years in this investigation and have accumulated<lb/>
a great amount of unpublished data. Until recently I hadn't the slightest desire<lb/>
to earn <unclear>any</unclear> money out of this investigation but now, having found the remains of<lb/>
Camp Lazear and the remains of the famous Infected Clothing Building (Building No. 1)<lb/>
and having arranged to purchase it, I have taken upon myself the job of raising<lb/>
money to restore the building and if possible, build a little memorial building<lb/>
around it so that it can be preserved for posterity. For this reason alone I<lb/>
hope to be able to raise some money somewhere, somehow, from interested friends<lb/>
and some institutions with which Reed and Lazear were connected. If I should fail<lb/>
in collecting the money from friends, with this in mind I hope I might get enough<lb/>
returns from a monograph to at least start the ball rolling.</p>
<p>I have four papers now available for publication:<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. The amplified, corrected address as given in the Washington<lb/>
and Jefferson brochure. (This certainly should be made available to medical<lb/>
readers and should not be wasted on what is essentially a college advertisement.)</item>
<item>2. After much work I have got Kissinger to write out his story<lb/>
for me. It needed much correction and editing, and I have about finished this.<lb/>
Neither he nor Moran, the first ones who volunteered to Reed for experimentation<lb/>
have ever published their story.</item>
<pb n="2" id="f03801022"/>
<item>Dr. Henry E. Sigerist</item>
<item>- 2 -</item>
<item>January 22, 1941</item>
<item>3. I have also done the same thing with Moran's story and<lb/>
have promised both Kissinger and Moran to publish their own stories under their<lb/>
own names, with perhaps an editorial foreword by myself.</item>
<item>4. I am now writing at the request of the Minister of<lb/>
National Defense of the Cuban government, a documentary report on the true<lb/>
identity of Camp Lazear and the building which we discovered. A so-called<lb/>
&ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo; which the Cuban government has bought and memorialized by fence<lb/>
and sign and for the memorialization of which they have collected $200,000<lb/>
is the wrong place. Whether the Cubans accept my documentation or not, this<lb/>
same report, rewritten for a medical journal, should be made available for<lb/>
the medical public.</item>
</list></p>
<p>I have been wondering whether I should publish these four<lb/>
separately or save them all for a monograph, rather profusely illustrated with<lb/>
maps and other unpublished photographs which I have collected. The advantage<lb/>
of a monograph is that it might bring me in a few hundred dollars for the sake<lb/>
of my plane.</p>
<p>I should greatly appreciate your comments and advice. I believe<lb/>
on occasion your journal has published papers and later republished them as a<lb/>
monograph. Perhaps some such scheme could be worked out with these. Incidentally,<lb/>
General Truby is preparing his autobiography. I fear it may be too long for any<lb/>
one medical journal but as he has asked for my help and suggestions regarding his<lb/>
autobiography, I would appreciate knowing what the approximate length of any<lb/>
papers are that you publish and whether you would be interested in seeing his<lb/>
autobiography. He was commanding officer of Columbia Barracks where Reed and<lb/>
the other members of the Board planned all of their work. As such, he was<lb/>
intimately associated with all the work.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
