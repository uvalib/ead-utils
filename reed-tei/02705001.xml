<salute>My dear Dr: Kean,</salute>
</opener>
<p>No one regrets half<lb/>
as much as I do, my tardiness in an-<lb/>
swering your kind letter of inquiry in<lb/>
regard<del>s</del> to facts of Walter's birth. Nothing<lb/>
but the pressure of heavy domestic cares<lb/>
has prevented, for I assure you I appre-<lb/>
ciate to the fullest, your interest as well<lb/>
as the citizens of Gloucester, in preserving<lb/>
all matters of fact in regard to my<lb/>
dear brother. My mother's maiden name<lb/>
was Phaeaba White, She was the daughter<lb/>
of Stephen &amp; Christian White &amp; was born<lb/>
June 14, 1816, in the County of Pasquo-<lb/>
tank, N.C.- She was thirty-five years<lb/>
&amp; three months old when Walter was<lb/>
born &amp; he was the last of her children --<lb/>
the youngest -- I mean. Dr: William<lb/>
Waller was her physician- He was a<lb/>
near neighbor &amp; great friend of the family --<lb/>
was a young married man &amp; may be<lb/>
living now for aught I know. I was a<lb/>
child of eleven years &amp; well remember<lb/>
the house -- an old fashioned framed<lb/>
country house -- built in &ldquo;old timey&rdquo; style.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02705002"/>
2<lb/>
It was a small affair -- with one large<lb/>
room &amp; a smaller &ldquo;shed&rdquo; room back --<lb/>
one large room up stairs &amp; a porch<lb/>
in front- It was in a very small village<lb/>
called &ldquo;Belle Roy&rdquo; -- but I hardly think<lb/>
there were enough houses to justify the<lb/>
name even of a village. I could go to<lb/>
the house &amp; place my hands on it if<lb/>
I only had some sort of sufficient loco-<lb/>
motion! We lived there the first year of my<lb/>
father's appointment to Gloucester Circuit-<lb/>
The next year he had built, with the<lb/>
aid of his brethren of the circuit, just<lb/>
across the road &amp; not far from the house<lb/>
in which Walter was born, a much<lb/>
nicer &amp; more convenient home for the<lb/>
preacher. I suppose that house may<lb/>
be still standing- When Walter was a<lb/>
month old, (you know Gloucester is the<lb/>
place for oysters &amp; we enjoyed them very<lb/>
often) my father so proud &amp; fond of him<lb/>
&amp; wishing to <del><unclear>christen</unclear></del> <add>initiate</add> him (I suppose) or<lb/>
to introduce him to the best the country,<lb/>
very &ldquo;sillily&rdquo; (my word) gave him a small<lb/>
oyster!- Then Dr: Waller was called in<lb/>
a hurry for our baby got very sick!-<lb/>
When he was four months old he con-<lb/>
tracted whooping cough &amp; that came<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02705003"/>
3<lb/>
near putting an end to his dear little life.<lb/>
But he outweathered the gale -- thanks to a<lb/>
kind Providence &amp; the care of a good physician<lb/>
&amp; the most devoted mother that ever lived!<lb/>
Another fright we had about his babyship<lb/>
was coming in contact with a very virulent<lb/>
form of scarlet-fever when he was six months<lb/>
old. We were visiting &amp; one of the six children<lb/>
of the family broke out (without any warning)<lb/>
with the fever. I had slept with the child<lb/>
just as she broke out with it- Of course we<lb/>
left the place &amp; were careful not to come in<lb/>
contact with others. Before the end of the<lb/>
week, two of the six children of our friend,<lb/>
had died with the fever. But we never<lb/>
contracted it at all. I will say here<lb/>
that I think the village or post-office of<lb/>
&ldquo;Belle Roy&rdquo;, was about six miles from<lb/>
the Court House. There were four other<lb/>
children. Beginning with myself --<lb/>
the oldest -- Laura, James Clayton,-<lb/>
Thomas Walk, Christopher -- &amp; Walter,<lb/>
I think that you might get some facts<lb/>
from my brother J. C. Reed, His<lb/>
address is 518 Clay Street, Lynchburg, Va-<lb/>
if you have time to write to him -- I<lb/>
being the oldest child &amp; only daughter<lb/>
was sent away to school very early &amp; hence<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02705004"/>
4<lb/>
after I was fourteen years old, I saw the<lb/>
dear little boy only in vacations- Then being<lb/>
married when he was about ten years old<lb/>
took me away from home again. That's why<lb/>
I think that my brother could give you a<lb/>
more interesting letter than myself- I see that<lb/>
I have forgotten to give you the date of my<lb/>
mother's death. She died in Charlottesville<lb/>
Feb; 5. 1866. -- aged, 49 years, 5 months &amp; 19 days.<lb/>
I have &ldquo;jumbled&rdquo; up things very much Dr:<lb/>
Kean but if you could know under what<lb/>
disabilities I write, you would readily<lb/>
excuse an old woman. As to the coat of<lb/>
arms -- I had it once -- found it in a<lb/>
very valuable work on English &amp; Scotch<lb/>
names owned by Dr: W. H. H. Shackston<lb/>
of Farmville, While there visiting my<lb/>
father in 1897- I was much interested<lb/>
in looking our names &amp; copied our coat of<lb/>
arms for fun- Think I sent it to one of<lb/>
my brothers- I will try my best to get it for<lb/>
you if the book can be found- But Dr: Shackston<lb/>
has died since &amp; I hear that his library was<lb/>
destroyed- Will do my best &amp; write to-night<lb/>
for the information you wish. Hoping I haven't<lb/>
wearied you &amp; wishing you would write again<lb/>
&amp; assuring you there's nothing dearer to me than<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02705005"/>

the life &amp; memory of my darling brother<lb/>
I remain</p>
