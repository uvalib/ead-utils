From<lb/>
Transactions of the International Conference on Health Problems<lb/>
in Tropical America. Held at Kingston, Jamaica, B. W. I.<lb/>
<dateline>
July 22 to <date value="1924-08-01">August 1, 1924.</date>

(Part of discussion of Dr. Agramonte's paper: Yellow Fever<lb/>
Prophylaxis)<lb/>
</opener>
<p><hi>Dr. Henry Rose Carter</hi>:--The question concerns not yellow fever, but<lb/>
the efficacy shown by the vaccine of the culture of <hi>Leptospira icteroides</hi><lb/>
and by the serum made from that same culture. It is possibly unfortunate<lb/>
that you called upon me, because it would hard to find one who has less<lb/>
personal first-hand knowledge of this thing than I. I have, however, some<lb/>
knowledge of the statements and writings of other people on the subject.</p>
<p>When Dr. Noguchi returned from Guayaquil, I went to see him as<lb/>
soon as I knew of his claim. He showed me everything he had to show.<lb/>
There was nothing he kept back from me. To me the question was whether<lb/>
he had derived his parasite from cases of yellow fever, or from cases of<lb/>
<hi>L. ictero hemorrhagica</hi>--<hi>Weil's disease</hi>. I had had much to do with yellow<lb/>
fever, and had been what Americans call &ldquo;the goat&rdquo; in making diagnoses<lb/>
in many first cases and knew how easy it was to mistake one for the other.</p>
<p>At that time I had seen but five cases of <hi>Weil's disease</hi>; I said<lb/>
then, that if I saw these occurring in a yellow fever zone in cities of the<lb/>
southern United States I should suspect them of being yellow fever; and<lb/>
that if they occurred during an epidemic of yellow fever. I should so con-<lb/>
sider them, almost without examination. It was not easy to distinguish<lb/>
between the two.</p>
<p>In Guayaquil, Dr. Noguchi reported that over 60% of the rats ex-<lb/>
amined showed ictero-hemorrhagica. The association of people with rats<lb/>
in Guayaquil must have been very close, because bubonic plague among the<lb/>
population was common there at that time. It was reason</p>

<p>Carter (Henry Rose)<lb/>
The History of Yellow Fever,<lb/>
Section 1. Epidemiology. p. 5.</p>
<p>For the naturally continued existence of yellow fever in any<lb/>
place there are necessary three factors (co-existent at that place):</p>
<p>(1) The causative organism of the disease. For this the writer<lb/>
accepts the <hi>Leptospira icteroides</hi> of Noguchi.*****</p>
