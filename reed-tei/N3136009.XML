<p>BELROI, BIRTHPLACE<lb/>
OF WALTER REED,<lb/>
MADE PUBLIC SHRINE</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Gloucester County Home Ded-<lb/>
icated; Tribute Is Paid To<lb/>
&ldquo;Father of Sanitation&rdquo;</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Gloucester, Va., Oct. 15.--<unclear>(AP)</unclear>--&ldquo;Bel-<lb/>
roi,&rdquo; birthplace of Dr. Walter Reed,<lb/>
restored virtually to the condition in<lb/>
which it was at the time of the boy-<lb/>
hood of the great public health leader,<lb/>
was dedicated today as a national<lb/>
shrine before several hundred persons<lb/>
who had gathered to do honor to the<lb/>
&ldquo;father of public health work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exercises held near here were<lb/>
under the auspices of the Medical So-<lb/>
ciety of Virginia, and the Walter Reed<lb/>
Memorial Commission through whose<lb/>
instrumentality the restoration was<lb/>
made. Tributes of the highest order<lb/>
were paid the conqueror of yellow fever<lb/>
by several spectators and many nota-<lb/>
bles were among the audience. During<lb/>
the ceremony planes from Langley<lb/>
Field circled over the home.</p>
<p>Dr. Edward C. S. Taliaferro, chairman<lb/>
of the commission, acted as master of<lb/>
ceremonies, explaining the purpose of<lb/>
the gathering was to dedicate to the<lb/>
world the birthplace of that eminent<lb/>
physician, Dr. Reed, who gave of his<lb/>
time and energies unstintingly that<lb/>
mankind might be freed forever from<lb/>
the scourge of yellow fever.</p>
<p>History of Memorial</p>
<p>Dr. Clarence Porter Jones, of New-<lb/>
port News, ardent worker for the res-<lb/>
toration of the small frame building in<lb/>
which Dr. Reed was born, gave the<lb/>
history of the Walter Reed memorial,<lb/>
telling of the origin of the idea with<lb/>
C. K. Weaver, of Newport News, a na-<lb/>
tive of Gloucester, in 1923. He traced<lb/>
the subsequent steps to the acquisition<lb/>
of the property in April of this year.<lb/>
Outlining the motives for the restora-<lb/>
tion, Dr. Jones said they were &ldquo;first<lb/>
to honor a great military hero, the<lb/>
first one who had achieved fame for<lb/>
saving life; second, to encourage re-<lb/>
search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no better way to stimulate<lb/>
research than to tell the world the<lb/>
story of Walter Reed. The commis-<lb/>
sion is determined it shall be told in<lb/>
every school and college in America. It<lb/>
will kindle the young hearts with a<lb/>
zeal to do something for humanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will bring forth fruit a thousand<lb/>
fold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker characterized Dr. Reed<lb/>
as the first epidermologist, the greatest<lb/>
benefactor to the Tidewater, the great-<lb/>
est health educator that has ever<lb/>
lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an international figure,&rdquo; Dr.<lb/>
Jones declared in conclusion, &ldquo;ranking<lb/>
no less than Jennor Pasture, Lister,<lb/>
McDowell, Sims and Long. His image<lb/>
should be cast in gold and placed in<lb/>
the public squares of every city in the<lb/>
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A letter was read from Mrs. Wil-<lb/>
minia Fleet Taliaferro, president of the<lb/>
Gloucester County Women's Club, un-<lb/>
der whose direction the furnishings of<lb/>
the Reed home were restored. She was<lb/>
unable to be present.</p>
<p>What Reed Did</p>
<p>Dr. J. D. Clements paid a glowing<lb/>
tribute to Dr. Reed in introducing Dr.<lb/>
Lawrence T. Royster, of Norfolk, who<lb/>
spoke on &ldquo;what Walter Reed means to<lb/>
medical research.&rdquo; Dr. Royster char-<lb/>
acterized the Reed home as &ldquo;the birth-<lb/>
place of an immortal,&rdquo; declaring that<lb/>
&ldquo;by common consent the name of Wal-<lb/>
ter Reed is placed in that galaxy of<lb/>
brilliant investigators: Pasture, Koch,<lb/>
Lister, Jennor, Von Bochring, Morten<lb/>
and Long and the brillance of that<lb/>
galaxy is increased by the addition<lb/>
of his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During his discourse he traced the<lb/>
efforts of the great physician which<lb/>
culminated in the conquest of yellow<lb/>
fever and paid a tribute to his devotion<lb/>
in often risking his life for humanity.</p>
<p>Col. J. R. Kean was introduced by<lb/>
Representative S. Otis Bland, of the<lb/>
First district, the speaker being a man<lb/>
who had been associated with Dr. Reed<lb/>
in the army. He traced the early and<lb/>
later life of Dr. Reed through his dis-<lb/>
covery of the mosquito as a transmitter<lb/>
of disease. The Rev. Dr. James C.<lb/>
Reed, brother of the eminent army sur-<lb/>
geon concluded the program with the<lb/>
benediction.</p>
