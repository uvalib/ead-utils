<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I hope you had a pleasant trip East and am sorry<lb/>
that I missed you. I want to thank you especially for your<lb/>
plan to give one hundred dollars to the Lazear Building.<lb/>
This is mighty fine of you and I had no thought of your doing<lb/>
it. I appreciate it more than I can say.</p>
<p>In telling you the following I am sincerely not<lb/>
asking you to raise the amount. I think it is a swell gift.<lb/>
I do think I ought to tell you, however, that in the main<lb/>
lobby of the building will be a great bronze plate giving<lb/>
the names of all who have given one hundred and fifty dollars<lb/>
or more. The payment of this amount extending over a period<lb/>
of three years. It may be that you would like to be on that<lb/>
and permanently recorded there as having had a part in the<lb/>
Lazear Building. Of course, I would like to have your name<lb/>
there too. Please do not feel that you have to raise this.<lb/>
If I thought it was important I would ask you to do so, but<lb/>
it isn't. I just want you to know about it.</p>
<p>W C John <hi>hall - data on experiments</hi> knew all the<lb/>
people involved<lb/>
wasn't there at the time</p>
<p>We are going on with our plans for Founders' Day<lb/>
and still studying the matter of a leading speaker. Three<lb/>
suggestions have come to me which are impressive. One is<lb/>
Doctor Leahy of Boston, the second Doctor Balfour of Mayos<lb/>
and the third is Doctor Abel of Louisville. I would rather<lb/>
not consider Doctor <hi>Balfour</hi> because of the fact that I hope<lb/>
to have you taking a part in the program. When you have<lb/>
your list of suggestions ready be sure to send it in to me<lb/>
with any details possible.</p>

<p>O or yellow <hi>fever</hi></p>
<p>Continue to work on the story of Lazear and his<lb/>
assistants and get such pictures as you can. It seems to<lb/>
me that we might very well combine this lecture with the<lb/>
presentation of Yellow Jack.</p>
<p>Give my love to Mary. We hope all the family are<lb/>
well.</p>
