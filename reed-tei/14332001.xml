HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT<lb/>
OF HAVANA AND PINAR DEL RIO,<lb/>
QUEMADOS, CUBA<lb/>
<salute>My dearest Gran</salute>
</opener>
<p>I feel that I have<lb/>
by no means kept up<lb/>
my record as a Dutiful<lb/>
Son since Louise and the<lb/>
kids arrived. I have<lb/>
been especially busy lately<lb/>
because I have have to<lb/>
go into Havana for my<lb/>
work, and too, since the<lb/>
Army bill loomed above<lb/>
the horizon I spend all<lb/>
my spare half hours study-<lb/>
ing the hundred and one<lb/>
new departures of modern<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14332002"/>
medical science in pre-<lb/>
paration for my examina<lb/>
tion. For the bill will<lb/>
give me my promotion &amp;<lb/>
I expect my examination<lb/>
within a month.</p>
<p>I suppose Louise has written<lb/>
you the brilliant results of<lb/>
the recent mosquito exper-<lb/>
iments, which have proved<lb/>
the theory beyond the per-<lb/>
adventure of a doubt.</p>
<p>I won't begin on this sub-<lb/>
ject as I never know<lb/>
when to stop. I will only<lb/>
mention that the effort<lb/>
to make men catch the<lb/>
disease from infected<lb/>
bedding &amp; clothing has<lb/>
failed entirely altho.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14332003"/>
the house was kept heated &amp; moist and<lb/>
some of the clothing was foul to a<lb/>
degree that was dreadful to see &amp; to<lb/>
smell. So quarantine of goods and<lb/>
disinfection for yellow fever are now<lb/>
things of the past, and our friends of<lb/>
the Marine hospital service will have<lb/>
not little to do. There was a big din-<lb/>
ner last night in honor of Dr Carlos<lb/>
Finlay who has been maintaining the<lb/>
mosquito theory for the past 15 years<lb/>
though he was never able to prove it.<lb/>
All the prominent physicians of the town were<lb/>
there &amp; Gen. Wood &amp; the Medical officer of<lb/>
higher rank. Your humble servant sat<lb/>
on Dr Finlays right, &amp; enjoyed himself<lb/>
greatly. This dinner marks the profes-<lb/>
sional and official acceptance of<lb/>
the theory in Havana, and I drew<lb/>
a mosquito order which Gen Wood<lb/>
will publish tomorrow, ordering the<lb/>
use of mosquito bars, and the distruct-<lb/>
ion of mosquito larvae by kerosine<unclear>oil.</unclear><lb/>
Well Louise &amp; Mrs Stark got their box<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14332004"/>
on the <unclear>25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></unclear> and were<lb/>
greatly pleased with<lb/>
its contents. They are<lb/>
both as busy as can<lb/>
be with Xmas prepar-<lb/>
ations. The mess is<lb/>
so far very congenial &amp;<lb/>
jolly, and altho- it keeps<lb/>
Louise pretty busy to<lb/>
run it, she can do it<lb/>
so much more reasonably<lb/>
and so much better<lb/>
than any one else how-<lb/>
ever that she has be-<lb/>
come reconciled to the<lb/>
idea. Mrs Burton &amp;<lb/>
the two Burton girls<lb/>
come tomorrow. If they<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14332005"/>
are as pleasant mess-<lb/>
mates as the Col. all<lb/>
will be well.</p>
<p>What I will do after<lb/>
Col. Havard returns is<lb/>
still undecided, as I<lb/>
hate to cause the Starks<lb/>
a <unclear>move.</unclear> I am going<lb/>
to ask Havard to leave<lb/>
me unassigned until<lb/>
after my examination<lb/>
so that I can get a<lb/>
little chance to study.</p>
<p>For I havent had any<lb/>
to speak of since I<lb/>
left Fort Warren &amp; for<lb/>
over a year did not<lb/>
have any books.<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14332006"/>
As soon as I get my majority I will<lb/>
be perfectly willing to come back<lb/>
to the U. S. and think it probable<lb/>
that I will do so in the spring.<lb/>
Mama has improved so much since her<lb/>
arrival, and seems to enjoy Louise and<lb/>
the children so much. She is I think<lb/>
much happier than she has been since<lb/>
my father's death. You ought to see her<lb/>
pet and admire the beautiful Bobs,<lb/>
who improves in good looks and size<lb/>
daily. Martha has lost most of her<lb/>
beauty with her hair, but is as ruddy<lb/>
and fat as can be - and reasonably<lb/>
good. She has some playmates now, the<lb/>
Stark boys &amp; Caldwell's &amp; others.</p>
<p>Louise says she will write you a long letter<lb/>
as soon as Xmas is over and tell you all<lb/>
about it. Mama was very sorry not to see you<lb/>
but Mr Young seems to have given her a<lb/>
fine time and quite won her heart.<lb/>
I hope he received a box of Portages cigars<lb/>
which I sent him. We sent Dr M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Carroll <unclear>a</unclear><lb/>
silver dish and <unclear>Manie</unclear> a <unclear>Jap-</unclear> workbox which is<lb/>
the extent of the Kean Xmas.</p>
<p>With love to all the family, I am dearly <unclear>Gran</unclear></p>
