<salute>Dear Doctor,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter dated simply June came this week and I<lb/>
am very glad to hear from you and to know that you have been<lb/>
able to finish your writing.</p>
<p>I have not yet received the carbon which you state<lb/>
Dr. Russell would send me, but I suppose I shall get it by next<lb/>
mail, and I also suppose you have already ascertained the<lb/>
address of Guiteras, if not I can tell you that it is,
&lsquo;Benevides,<lb/>
Mantanzas, Cuba.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I also knew of your conclusion regarding the African<lb/>
origin of Yellow Fever, and because it explained so many things<lb/>
otherwise inexplicable, I was from the very first, willing to<lb/>
accept it as the truth, however, I will write more fully about<lb/>
that after I have read your paper.</p>
<p>My work is going along as well as could be expected,<lb/>
and despite the fact that I find here, as I have always found<lb/>
and always expect to find in every new field, certain new pro-<lb/>
blems not encountered before, and which must be met and handled<lb/>
on their own merits.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01206007"/>
<p>Dr. H.R.. Carter</p>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>7th. July, 1924.</p>
<p>I don't quite understand your remark about many people<lb/>
on the coast being immune as such immunity is <add>the</add> rule in all<lb/>
endemic countries that I have ever seen and along with that<lb/>
immunity in the coastal cities, there is an immense amount of<lb/>
contact with the high country in the rear which furnishes a cons-<lb/>
tant supply of non-immunes.</p>
<p>I feel a little more confortable about West Africa. The<lb/>
first reason being that up to the present time all the ships<lb/>
coming from West Africa are very, very slow steamers. There has<lb/>
been only one sailing vessel in 18 months, so I am informed, and<lb/>
that was a yacht. There is more contact going from Brazil to<lb/>
Africa - many times more - but that does not hurt. The second<lb/>
reason is that all the contact is with Dakar which at least is<lb/>
apparently clean at the present time, while, from all the infor-<lb/>
mation I have been able to get, the bulk of the infection is in<lb/>
the Bight of Benin, certainly at Lagos and Accra, and most pro-<lb/>
bably in the big mud walled native city of Abeokuta of 150,000<lb/>
people, about 150 miles from the coast.</p>
<p>Coming back to personal matters, the family like Brazil<lb/>
and naturally I am very glad to have them for I am getting old,<lb/>
and I miss home more and more all the time, and of course my wife<lb/>
and two daughters make home wherever they are.</p>
<p>You refer to Dr. Go<add>e</add>ldi of Par&aacute; and ask me to thank him<lb/>
for the extract from his book, but I shall not be able to comply<lb/>

Dr. H.R. Carter<lb/>
- 3 -<lb/>
7th. July, 1924.<lb/>
with your request for Go<add>e</add>ldi has gone to his &ldquo;long Home&rdquo;, and if<lb/>
the Priests and Prophets of our faith know what they are talking<lb/>
about, Go<add>e</add>ldi now knows much more about Yellow Fever than you or<lb/>
I. You speak of being near the end, and I sometimes think that<lb/>
I also am nearing the end, and I doubt if I shall undertake ano-<lb/>
ther task as strenuous as have been the Mexican and Brazilian<lb/>
campaigns, though I really would like to initiate the work in<lb/>
Africa for many reasons, the principal of these being that I have<lb/>
gathered a great deal of data which I have sifted very carefully,<lb/>
that I have spent many sleepless nights in what old Dr. Jimmie<lb/>
Reid used to call &ldquo;study without books&rdquo;, and that I believe that<lb/>
I have a better and deeper conception of the African problem than<lb/>
anybody else now engaged in the work. Hence it is logical that<lb/>
I should want to inaugurate the campaign, but I do not want to<lb/>
complete it, or at least I could not.</p>
<p>All the family join me in sending love to you and all.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
