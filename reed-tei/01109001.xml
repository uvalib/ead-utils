<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You will find enclosed graphs showing yellow fever cases<lb/>
and deaths reported in Mexico which were used in the docket for the<lb/>
meeting of the International Health Board on May 22, 1923. I am<lb/>
sending you also maps showing yellow fever areas in the Western Hemis-<lb/>
phere and the location of the yellow fever epidemic in Colombia.</p>
<p>We have sent you from time to time information concerning<lb/>
yellow fever conditions in Africa, Brazil, and Colombia. To make<lb/>
sure that you have as up-to-date information as is available from<lb/>
the reports that have come to us, I am sending the following summary:</p>
<p><hi>COLOMBIA.</hi> Reports were received in March of the outbreak of an<lb/>
epidemic in Bucaramanga, Colombia. There had been 20 cases with<lb/>
8 deaths from a disease having many of the symptoms of yellow<lb/>
fever. Later investigations showed that the disease first ap-<lb/>
peared as a single case in November, 1922, with 2 more cases in<lb/>
December; from January 1 to March 7 there appeared 70 more cases<lb/>
with 20 deaths. Diagnosis of yellow fever was at first ruled<lb/>
out because of the high altitude and the distance of Bucaramanga<lb/>
from any infected area. On invitation of government, the Board<lb/>
sent Dr. J. H. White, Dr. W. Pareja of Guayaquil, and Dr. O. L.<lb/>
Pothier of New Orleans to investigate the situation.</p>
<p>Dr. Pareja and Dr. Pothier joined Dr. White in Colon on<lb/>
April 18. They went at once to Bucaramanga by way of Barranquilla.<lb/>

Doctor Carter<lb/>
June 1, 1923<lb/>
2<lb/>
Under date of May 4, a cable was received from Dr. Miller confirm-<lb/>
ing the diagnosis of yellow fever in Bucaramanga. A cable dated<lb/>
May 16 was later received, saying: diagnosis accepted by government;<lb/>
further investigation necessary; Cucuta regarded as one possible<lb/>
source, Barranquilla another; investigation will require about six<lb/>
weeks longer; government agrees to assume one-half of the expense;<lb/>
probable cost to the Board of undertaking control measures in Col-<lb/>
ombia from June, 1923, to January, 1924, $50,000.</p>
<p><hi>VENEZUELA.</hi> Through the New York office of the Asiatic Petroleum Com-<lb/>
pany, Limited, with which the Colon Development Company is affili-<lb/>
ated, we hear of a rumor of a yellow fever epidemic in the vicinity<lb/>
of Mene Grande, an oil centre near Lagunillas, in 1921. The infor-<lb/>
mation was only hearsay. Effort is being made to trace the rumor.</p>
<p><hi>BRAZIL.</hi> The federal government has authorized the Department of Public<lb/>
Health of Brazil to accept the co-operation of the Board in yellow<lb/>
fever work. It is expected that a representative will go to Brazil<lb/>
as soon as possible to co-operate with the Brazilian authorities in<lb/>
making a survey of yellow fever conditions, particularly in Bahia<lb/>
and Ceara.</p>
<p><hi>WEST AFRICA.</hi> An epidemic of yellow fever was reported from Grand Bassam,<lb/>
Ivory Coast, in August, 1922. Twenty cases with 3 deaths were re-<lb/>
ported, together with one death in Togoland. There have been rumors<lb/>
of sporadic cases in Nigeria, Dahomey, Gold Coast, Gambia, and French<lb/>
Soudan.</p>
<p>Autopsy specimens have been received from only one case<lb/>
from West Africa suspected of being yellow fever. The specimens<lb/>
were examined by Doctor Darling and Doctor Noguchi. Doctor Darl-<lb/>
ing reported that he found none of the characteristic lesions of<lb/>
yellow fever, but the pigmentation and the bile staining of malaria.<lb/>
Doctor Noguchi considers it a borderline case which with the type<lb/>
of degeneration and necrosis in the liver, might have been either<lb/>
infectious jaundice or yellow fever. The clinical record he thinks<lb/>
would indicate either yellow fever or a very severe case of infec-<lb/>
tious jaundice. The histological appearance of the organs would<lb/>
indicate infectious jaundice rather than yellow fever. Efforts<lb/>
which have been made to obtain further autopsy tissues have so far<lb/>
been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>A cable just received from Doctor White dated Colon,<lb/>
May 30, 1923, states that he is expected to sail on the Parismina<lb/>
on May thirty first. This should bring him to New Orleans about<lb/>
June eighth.</p>
