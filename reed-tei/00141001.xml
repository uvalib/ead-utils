<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>The worst of the<lb/>
examinations came off yesterday and<lb/>
I am now through all except one on<lb/>
the arm which had been held before<lb/>
we got here. We are to have a<lb/>
special examination on that, on<lb/>
next Friday. I feel now that the<lb/>
<unclear>rest</unclear> is over and I am taking things<lb/>
more easy and looking around<lb/>
more. I went to an operation this<lb/>
morning by Prof. Chiene. And this afternoon<lb/>
I saw two post-mortems. I am<lb/>
still dissecting but I think I<lb/>
shall finish it up this week.</p>
<p>I finally succeeded in finding<lb/>
Mrs. Hailman on Saturday night.<lb/>
She was accompanied by George,<lb/>
Miss Hays and Miss <del><unclear>Haring</unclear></del> Waring.<lb/>
She had been in Edinburgh for several<lb/>
days, and while here she received<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00141002"/>
a letter from you saying that<lb/>
I was here. It was rather odd<lb/>
that she got it while in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>I took them around a little<lb/>
on Sunday afternoon and showed<lb/>
them some of the sights which they<lb/>
had not yet seen, and dined<lb/>
with them on Sunday evening.<lb/>
Mrs. Hailman sent her love to<lb/>
you and says she will write soon.<lb/>
She is looking very well as is<lb/>
also Miss Hays, Miss Waring who<lb/>
was with them is a very nice<lb/>
young girl. They went from here<lb/>
to York and will continue<lb/>
on to London and then they<lb/>
will make a trip to Switzerland.<lb/>
They will return to America<lb/>
in September.</p>
<p>I went to St. Giles Cathedral on<lb/>
Sunday and I was rather surprised<lb/>
at the Amount of Ceremony they<lb/>
went through. It is Presbyterian you<lb/>
know but they had robes, liturgy<lb/>
and everything.</p>
<p>Last night I heard a man playing<lb/>
the harp on the street and it was<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00141003"/>
one of the finest things I ever<lb/>
heard. He played a number of<lb/>
old Scoth and Irish airs, Tom<lb/>
Moore's songs. I wished that<lb/>
you could hear him as I<lb/>
know you would have<lb/>
enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I was sorry to learn by your<lb/>
letter of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of June that your<lb/>
room was so hot. You must<lb/>
not stay there if you are<lb/>
uncomfortable. You had better<lb/>
go <del>th</del> to the mountains for a few<lb/>
weeks and then go to Uncle<lb/>
Toms.</p>
<p>I will look around in London<lb/>
at some of the old furniture and<lb/>
I will also find what the<lb/>
duty will be. I have not<lb/>
seen any of the pebble breast-<lb/>
pins here, but I will look<lb/>
around for them.</p>
<p>I hope we shall succeed in<lb/>
doing better than Mrs. Denison's.<lb/>
However if we cannot we will<lb/>
have to go there again. We might<lb/>
be able to make some special<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00141004"/>
arrangement so as to get good<lb/>
pieces of <del>f</del> beef. I have no doubt<lb/>
that by judicious feeing we<lb/>
could manage to get the best<lb/>
cut every time. We used to<lb/>
have to put up with miserable<lb/>
fag ends last year whenever<lb/>
we were late.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
