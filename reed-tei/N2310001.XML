<p>STUDENT OF YELLOW-FEVER.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear Really Sacrificed His Life<lb/>
to Science.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>(Chicago Record.)</p>
<p>The recent death in Cuba of Dr. Jesse<lb/>
Lazear, caused by an attack of yellow<lb/>
fever, furnishes a pathetic and interest-<lb/>
ing example of one among a limited<lb/>
few who have really sacrificed them-<lb/>
selves to science. Sent by the United<lb/>
States government to investigate more<lb/>
fully the causes of yellow fever, which<lb/>
has always been the bane of the West<lb/>
Indies, Dr. Lazear at once devoted him-<lb/>
self assiduously to the task before him.<lb/>
Working early and late in a climate to<lb/>
which he was entirely unused and<lb/>
which was swarming with the germs<lb/>
he was studying, it is not strange that<lb/>
he himself fell an easy prey to the rav-<lb/>
ages of the dreaded bacillus.</p>
<p>For many reasons his untimely death<lb/>
is to be lamented. His superior training<lb/>
in scientific methods at Johns Hopkins<lb/>
university and his practical experience<lb/>
while connected with the clinical labora-<lb/>
tory of that institution peculiarly fitted<lb/>
him for the work to which he was call-<lb/>
ed. Previous to his appointment to<lb/>
Cuba he had made important original<lb/>
investigations into the finer structure<lb/>
of the malarial parasite and into the<lb/>
cardiac complications which often occur<lb/>
in certain of the venereal diseases. In<lb/>
fact, he early gave promise of being a<lb/>
valuable acquisition to the world of ex-<lb/>
perimental science which sincerely<lb/>
mourns his loss.</p>
<p>It may be of interest to mention brief-<lb/>
ly a few facts concerning the terrible<lb/>
scourge of those tropic islands, which<lb/>
Dr. Lazear was sent to investigate. In-<lb/>
deed, our own country is never immune<lb/>
from its fearful ravages. The southern<lb/>
states are particularly susceptible to<lb/>
epidemic, although, as in 1793 to 1802,<lb/>
regions as far north as Philadelphia,<lb/>
Baltimore and Boston suffered severely.<lb/>
The population of the first named city<lb/>
in 1793 was but 40,000, yet the mortality<lb/>
during September and October of that<lb/>
year was 3,435. In 1852 New Orleans<lb/>
suffered an epidemic in which the death<lb/>
list reached 8,000, while the latest ex-<lb/>
tended one --that of 1878--proved the<lb/>
most disastrous in history, 16,000 suc-<lb/>
cumbing in Louisiana, Mississippi and<lb/>
Alabama alone. During these epidem-<lb/>
ics negroes were shown to be less sus-<lb/>
ceptible to the disease than whites, yet<lb/>
they were far from being entirely im-<lb/>
mune, statistics showing that the per-<lb/>
centage of fatality in that race is about<lb/>
21, as compared to a percentage of 50<lb/>
in the white race. Successfully with-<lb/>
standing a single attack of the fever<lb/>
by one of either race, however, almost<lb/>
always renders one immune for life.</p>
<p>As to the causes of yellow fever, very<lb/>
little is known. For many years it has<lb/>
been suspected by bacteriologists that<lb/>
it is due to a specific microbe, yet it<lb/>
has been only within the last few years<lb/>
that any have attempted to describe it.<lb/>
Saurelli, the famous Italian investigator<lb/>
and director of the Institute of Experi-<lb/>
imental Medicine at Montevideo, re-<lb/>
cently submitted to the scientific world<lb/>
a description of the so-called icteriodes<lb/>
bacillus, which he claimed to have iso-<lb/>
lated. In his zeal to ascertain the<lb/>
truth of his theories concerning it, how-<lb/>
ever, he resorted to experiments which<lb/>
sadly mar his otherwise brilliant record<lb/>
as a scientist. He not only introduced<lb/>
the deadly cultures into the systems of<lb/>
lower animals, but wantonly subjected<lb/>
human beings to the same treatment.</p>
<p>He says: &ldquo;By this method I obtained<lb/>
all the symptoms of the disease.&rdquo;<lb/>
&ldquo;Such conduct,&rdquo; adds a recognized au-<lb/>
thority in medicine, &ldquo;is nothing short<lb/>
of criminal and should not be counte-<lb/>
nanced by the civilized world.&rdquo; Yet,<lb/>
notwithstanding these claims of Sau-<lb/>
relli and similar ones made later by<lb/>
Sternberg, surgeon general of the<lb/>
United States army, the medical world<lb/>
is to-day much in the dark concern this<lb/>
disease and its specific cause.</p>
<p>In the beginning of an attack of yel-<lb/>
low fever a slight chill is common, ac-<lb/>
companied by headache and pains in<lb/>
the back and limbs. Fever soon comes<lb/>
on and rises rapidly. The face is<lb/>
flushed, the tongue furred but moist,<lb/>
the eyes red, the throat dry. Manifesta-<lb/>
tions of the progress of the disease now<lb/>
soon appear. Briefly stated, they are<lb/>
as follows: The skin becomes yellow,<lb/>
the patient throws up at frequent inter-<lb/>
vals quantities of the characteristic<lb/>
&ldquo;black vomit&rdquo; and external hem-<lb/>
orrhages are of frequent occurrence.<lb/>
Post-mortem examination usually re-<lb/>
veals fatty degeneration of the heart<lb/>
and liver, as well as swelling and in-<lb/>
flammation of the kidneys. The dura-<lb/>
tion of an attack is usually short, but<lb/>
severe, the mortality at various times<lb/>
ranging between 15 per cent. and 85<lb/>
per cent.</p>
<p>The treatment of to-day, together<lb/>
with careful nursing, is almost entirely<lb/>
symptomatic, such common drugs as<lb/>
iron and quinine being much in favor.<lb/>
Bleeding is never practiced as of old.<lb/>
Benjamin Rush, the famous physician<lb/>
of 100 years ago, for whom Rush med-<lb/>
ical college was named, is quoted as<lb/>
saying: &ldquo;From a newly arrived Eng-<lb/>
lishman I took 144 ounces of blood at<lb/>
12 bleedings in six days. I gave within<lb/>
the course of the same six days nearly<lb/>
150 grains of calomel, with the usual<lb/>
proportions of jalap and camboge.&rdquo;<lb/>
Yet this man of heroic treatment and<lb/>
dosage seems to have been eminently<lb/>
successful in many cases, as the records<lb/>
show.</p>
<p>In view of a disease so terrible and<lb/>
often so far-reaching in its effects,<lb/>
should not the American people give<lb/>
honor to whom honor is due by crown-<lb/>
ing the work of Dr. Lazear as heroic<lb/>
in the extreme?</p>
