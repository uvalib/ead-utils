Sergeant and Mrs. J. A. Sabatini<lb/>
Apartment 4, Second Floor<lb/>
Building 56-B<lb/>
Army War College<lb/>
Washington 25, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Sergeant and Mrs. Sabatini:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You were very kind to let me visit your apartment last month when<lb/>
I came with General W. L. Reed to visit the one room of your apartment in<lb/>

which General Reed's father, Major Walter Reed, died in 1902. We told you<lb/>
that at that time, the building in which you now live was a small Army hos-<lb/>
pital. Major Walter Reed, perhaps the most distinguished Army physician in<lb/>
the history of the United States Army, the &ldquo;conqueror of yellow fever&rdquo; developed<lb/>
an acute suppurative appendicitis and was cared for in the room which is now<lb/>
your parlor. He died in that room. (If you hear any ghostly sounds at night<lb/>
in that room you will know that you have a most distinguished ghost.)</p>
<p>The places where great men live and die will always be of interest<lb/>
to historians and I and the Walter Reed Memorial Association were anxious to<lb/>
locate this room. It was identified by General Albert E. Truby, now of<lb/>
San Francisco, who visited this room with General Reed last summer. I enclose<lb/>
some copies of the photographs we took of your room. Should you wish more<lb/>
I should be glad to send you some.</p>
<p>The Walter Reed Memorial Association has asked General Truby to pre-<lb/>
pare a report identifying the old room where Walter Reed died. Either he or<lb/>
I will write to the Commanding Officer of the Army War College requesting old<lb/>
maps showing the floor plan of this building as of 1902 and as more recently<lb/>
changed. If we are unable to obtain such plans (they may not be easy to find)<lb/>
may we ask you kindly to send to us a rough sketch of the entire second floor<lb/>
floor plan and its relation with the downstairs front entrance.</p>
<p>In order that you may know a little about Walter Reeds contribution,<lb/>
I am sending you by separate post a reprint which I hope will interest you.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
