<salute>Miss Emilie,</salute>
</opener>
<p>After a short<lb/>
and pleasant trip of about<lb/>
24 hours duration, I arrived<lb/>
at this destination just one<lb/>
week ago. My sister and her<lb/>
little children were anx-<lb/>
iously awaiting my <del>recep</del><lb/>
arrival and accorded me a<lb/>
very warm reception. I<lb/>
have talked myself almost<lb/>
out of breath, narrating<lb/>
my wonderful adventures of<lb/>
the past few years, and try-<lb/>
ing to amuse the children<lb/>
with remarkable tales of<lb/>
New York City-life. Have, also,<lb/>
had the pleasure of grasping<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01619002"/>
the hands of a few old ac-<lb/>
quaintances &amp; some young<lb/>
acquaintances. The latter of<lb/>
these were mere children<lb/>
when I last visited this place,<lb/>
but have now bloomed into<lb/>
womanhood &amp; manhood.<lb/>
I never felt old age weigh-<lb/>
ing more heavily on my shoul-<lb/>
ders than when I am intro-<lb/>
duced to &ldquo;Mr or Miss So &amp; So&rdquo;<lb/>
whom I only knew as infants<lb/>
in their mothers' arms. I am<lb/>
sure that I shall soon be<lb/>
grey. The thought causes me<lb/>
to cry aloud with the poet;<lb/>
&ldquo;Oh! for one hour of youthful joy,<lb/>
Give back my twentieth spring;<lb/>
I'd rather laugh, a fair-haired boy,<lb/>
Than reign, a grey-beard King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that I<lb/>
have been made to reflect<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01619003"/>
on my &ldquo;ancient days,&rdquo; I never<lb/>
had a more pleasant visit,<lb/>
(of course, my visits to Mur-<lb/>
freesboro excepted,). There<lb/>
are two young ladies, of about<lb/>
18 summers <add>in the house</add>, so that there is<lb/>
but little danger of my having<lb/>
the &ldquo;blues,&rdquo; even if I was so<lb/>
disposed.</p>
<p>This much of my letter<lb/>
by way of a preface. Prepare<lb/>
yourself for the perusal of<lb/>
the remainder; nay more,<lb/>
when you have read thus<lb/>
far, I earnestly request that<lb/>
you seek some quiet apart-<lb/>
ment and a comfortable chair;<lb/>
that then ridding your mind<lb/>
of every disturbing thought,<lb/>
you carefully read and<lb/>
seriously ponder all my<lb/>
words. Be patient with me;<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01619004"/>
hear all I have to say and then<lb/>
judge me accordingly. You<lb/>
may, at first, think it strange<lb/>
that I should speak of my<lb/>
future life and prospects; but<lb/>
I hold ideas different from<lb/>
many young men- In approach-<lb/>
ing so momentous a subject,<lb/>
I believe that I should reveal<lb/>
everything within my knowledge,<lb/>
or else I know not how you<lb/>
can possibly arrive at a sen-<lb/>
sible &amp; sound conclusion. This<lb/>
opinion of mine will explain what<lb/>
immediately follows. You know<lb/>
that I <del>have</del> will soon enter<lb/>
the medical corps of the U.S.<lb/>
Army- It is more than prob-<lb/>
able; nay, it amounts almost<lb/>
to a certainty that I shall<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01619005"/>
spend the next ten or fifteen<lb/>
years of my life in this ser-<lb/>
vice. Circumstances over which<lb/>
I have no control and concer-<lb/>
ning which I possess no knowl-<lb/>
edge may, on the one hand,<lb/>
cause me to resign my of-<lb/>
fice in a few years, or, on the<lb/>
other hand, lead me to remain<lb/>
in the Army all my life; the<lb/>
position being one which I<lb/>
can retain as long as I<lb/>
choose or resign whenever<lb/>
it shall seem fit. Heaven<lb/>
alone knows which of these courses<lb/>
I shall pursue.</p>
<p>And now I have determined,<lb/>
Miss Emilie, to solve the &ldquo;mys-<lb/>
tery&rdquo; of which I spoke in my<lb/>
last letter, and I do it with<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01619006"/>
&ldquo;fear &amp; trembling.&rdquo; Never did I<lb/>
approach a task with greater<lb/>
misgivings or less hopes. In for-<lb/>
mer letters I have spoken of<lb/>
my admiration for you in very<lb/>
plain terms. It is needless for<lb/>
me to say that I knew you but<lb/>
to admire you. A more exten-<lb/>
ded acquaintance has dem-<lb/>
onstrated to me the beauty of<lb/>
your character, your womanly<lb/>
worth, the purity of your<lb/>
Christianity, the charm of your<lb/>
intellect, and has changed the<lb/>
feeling of <hi>friendly apprecia-<lb/>
tion</hi> into one of -- shall I say<lb/>
<hi>love</hi>? Do you start at the word?<lb/>
I pray you, repress your<lb/>
rising indignation and hear<lb/>
me further. No one could more<lb/>
fully appreciate my utter un-<lb/>
worthiness of even your<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01619007"/>
<hi>Esteem</hi> than I do, at this moment.<lb/>
Yet I feel that, though you should<lb/>
spurn my affection, I should<lb/>
never be ashamed of having<lb/>
revealed my love to <hi>so noble<lb/>
a woman</hi>. It is for this reason<lb/>
that I tell you that there is no<lb/>
burden I would not gladly bear<lb/>
for your sake; no battle of life<lb/>
that I would fear to fight in<lb/>
your behalf; no trial that I would<lb/>
not willingly accept. Do not<lb/>
think that I am unaware of<lb/>
the very great import of my<lb/>
words. Believe me I have given<lb/>
this subject much thought, by<lb/>
day &amp; by night, &amp; have weighed<lb/>
it, in all its aspects, as care-<lb/>
fully as it was possible for<lb/>
me to do. I know that it will<lb/>
receive equal consideration<lb/>
at your hands. 'Tis true you<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01619008"/>
will say that you have known<lb/>
me but for a short time and<lb/>
have <add>had</add> but little, very little op-<lb/>
portunity of forming a just<lb/>
estimate of my character. To<lb/>
establish this in a clear &amp; un-<lb/>
mista<add>ka</add>ble light would be my<lb/>
sweetest endeavour. What<lb/>
more remains to me than<lb/>
to offer <del>you</del> a <hi>true heart</hi> and<lb/>
a <hi>true hand</hi> for your accep-<lb/>
tance or rejection. And I beg<lb/>
of you that you frame your<lb/>
answer according to the un-<lb/>
mista<add>ka</add>ble utterance of your<lb/>
heart &amp; the best dictates of<lb/>
your judgement. Whether fav-<lb/>
orable or unfavorable, I shall<lb/>
accept it as sincere.</p>
<closer>
<salute>As ever, your very true friend,</salute>
<signed>Walter Reed</signed>.
