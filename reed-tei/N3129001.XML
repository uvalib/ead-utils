<p>THE TIMES-HERALD. NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINIA, FRIDAY, AUGUST 12, 1927.</p>
<p>REED HOME NOW<lb/>
IS PRACTICALLY<lb/>
LIKE ORIGINAL</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Home of Dr. Walter Reed Has<lb/>
Been Rebuilt so as to Conform<lb/>
as Nearly as Possible to the<lb/>
Way It Appeared at the Time<lb/>
the Famous Physician Was<lb/>
Born.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Having been rebuilt so as to conform<lb/>
as nearly as possible to the way it<lb/>
looked at the time of Dr. Walter Reed's<lb/>
birth, Belroi, the home of the noted<lb/>
physician, soon will be restored and<lb/>
be made into a shrine as a memorial<lb/>
to the man who discovered the mos-<lb/>
quito to be a carrier of yellow fever,<lb/>
and who in other ways devoted his<lb/>
time, his energy and his money to im-<lb/>
proving the general health of the<lb/>
public.</p>
<p>Dr. Clarence Porter Jones, active<lb/>
member of the Walter Reed Mem-<lb/>
orial association, went yesterday to<lb/>
the old home to view the progress<lb/>
made by the workmen, taking as his<lb/>
guests, Dr. George Williams, J. L.<lb/>
Kibler and W. S. Copeland. Those<lb/>
who made the trip stated that the<lb/>
work has been all but finished, with<lb/>
only a few minor details remaining<lb/>
to be attended to.</p>
<p>The old house has been almost re-<lb/>
built, with new weather boarding on<lb/>
the sides and rear of the building,<lb/>
the front being covered with rem-<lb/>
nants of the original weather-stam<lb/>
ed clapboards which formerly<lb/>
sheahed the house. The old floors<lb/>
have been preserved and most of the<lb/>
doors. The mantlepieces which<lb/>
stood over the hearths in the days<lb/>
of the famous physician's youth have<lb/>
been restored with one of the orig-<lb/>
inals in the rear room and a very<lb/>
close replica having been placed in<lb/>
the living room.</p>
<p>The house is only one and one-half<lb/>
stories high, with two rooms on the<lb/>
first floor and a small guest room<lb/>
above. The dimensions of the house<lb/>
are 24 by 21 feet, the rear room, in<lb/>
which the noted man was born, be-<lb/>
ing little more than a leanto, though<lb/>
under the same roof with the living<lb/>
room. There were originally two<lb/>
chimneys to the house, but the fam-<lb/>
ily which recently lived there had<lb/>
the front chimney torn down and<lb/>
an additional room built. During the<lb/>
work of restoration this room was<lb/>
removed and the chimney rebuilt<lb/>
with the same bricks from which it<lb/>
was first constructed.</p>
<p>The floors and walls of the build-<lb/>
ing are in good shape, it was said,<lb/>
little being necessary in the way of<lb/>
repairs to the floor and the walls,<lb/>
being freshened and preserved by a<lb/>
coat of white finishing. A new shing-<lb/>
le roof as been put on the house and<lb/>
the entire exterior treated with<lb/>
priming and white paint. An old<lb/>
log kitchen which formerly stood in<lb/>
the rear of the dwelling will be re-<lb/>
stored in the near fture.</p>
<p>The building is surrounded by an<lb/>
acre of ground, with a crepe myrtle<lb/>
and walnut tree which stood in the<lb/>
yard during the youth of the man<lb/>
whose memory is enshrined within<lb/>
the walls of the little house, still<lb/>
casting their shade on the lawn. The<lb/>
grounds has not as yet been given<lb/>
much attention as yet, but the as-<lb/>
sociation intends to beautify them<lb/>
and build a permanent fence about<lb/>
the place. It is the hope of those in-<lb/>
terested in the restoration of Belroi,<lb/>
to make it a museum to the memory<lb/>
of the man who first saw the light<lb/>
of day within its narrow confines by<lb/>
the gradual acquisition of the old<lb/>
furniture, books and various articles<lb/>
connected with the boyhood and the<lb/>
manhood of Dr. Walter Reed.</p>
<p>The place is now in first class<lb/>
condition, being beautifully situated<lb/>
and those who have seen the work<lb/>
of transformation declare that when<lb/>
the work on the grounds has been<lb/>
accomplished that it will be one of<lb/>
the most attractive spots in the<lb/>
vicinity.</p>
