<salute>My sweet, little &ldquo;B.&rdquo;;</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is Monday after-<lb/>
noon, the hour 1 P.M., and your sweet<lb/>
letter of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> has just been<lb/>
perused. I am very glad that there<lb/>
was no real ground for my sur-<lb/>
mises and am much relieved to<lb/>
know that there is none. I must<lb/>
confess that, after the first mo-<lb/>
ments of excitement had passed<lb/>
away, &amp; reflection had taken<lb/>
her wanted throne, I began to<lb/>
think that there was but little<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01647002"/>
cause for my suppositions. Nev-<lb/>
ertheless, I am not sorry that<lb/>
for a time, at least, I did believe<lb/>
my suppositions true, since it<lb/>
afforded me all opportunity of<lb/>
disclosing <hi>my <add>true</add> frame of mind</hi>, and<lb/>
of telling you how very dear<lb/>
you <del>w</del>are to me. For the <del>true</del><lb/>
disclosure of the source of your<lb/>
anxiety, I will wait till we<lb/>
chance to shake hands again.<lb/>
You ask, how it is possible for<lb/>
you to trust me implicitly when,<lb/>
each day, &ldquo;our trusts are be-<lb/>
trayed&rdquo;, etc. Well, my pretty, little<lb/>
&ldquo;B.&rdquo;, I understand you perfectly,<lb/>
I think- It is hard; it is impossi-<lb/>
ble to put such complete con-<lb/>
fidence in another; &amp; we are<lb/>
apt to be <add>the more</add> cautious just in<lb/>
the proportion that the bretray-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01647003"/>
al of that confidence <del>are</del> would<lb/>
afflict us. This is right: this is<lb/>
human. I ask no more than your<lb/>
&ldquo;partial&rdquo; confidence. It shall <add>be</add> my<lb/>
task to make myself <hi>wholly</hi><lb/>
worthy of it- Did you know my<lb/>
heart as I do, my darling, not<lb/>
a ripple would disturb the<lb/>
tranquillity of your thoughts.<lb/>
Don't complain of a &ldquo;dearth&rdquo;<lb/>
of letters- You cannot ex-<lb/>
pect me, my little sweetheart,<lb/>
to be equal to writing <hi>four</hi>,<lb/>
every week. Such a prodigious<lb/>
effort would soon exhaust<lb/>
all my ideas. In fact, I don't<lb/>
think that I have, as yet,<lb/>
quite recovered from that<lb/>
particular week's work -- but<lb/>
of this you shall be the<lb/>
judge. Don't forget that one<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01647004"/>
of my letters, written last week,<lb/>
was equal to <hi>three</hi>, since it<lb/>
was written on <hi>three</hi> distinct<lb/>
days, giving you a complete<lb/>
synopsis of the week's events,<lb/>
together with my various<lb/>
moods, and containing <hi>not less</hi><lb/>
than <hi>12 long</hi> pages! So that,<lb/>
by examining into the matter a<lb/>
little more closely, you easily<lb/>
perceive that you really did<lb/>
receive <hi>four</hi> letters! I hear<lb/>
you exclaim; &ldquo;how very plain!<lb/>
how logical! how well this<lb/>
accords with many prior<lb/>
statements&rdquo;! To which I modestly<lb/>
reply; &ldquo;<hi>throw no bouquets,</hi> if you<lb/>
please&rdquo;! Before I forget it,<lb/>
permit me, with many as-<lb/>
severations of thanks, to re-<lb/>
turn my compliments for the<lb/>
very accurate drawing<del>s</del> and<lb/>
description of Willet's Point,<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01647005"/>
which you were so kind as<lb/>
to enclose. The gentleman I<lb/>
recognized as an exact like-<lb/>
ness of myself -- though a <hi>little</hi><lb/>
flattered, which shows me<lb/>
very clearly that you <hi>lean</hi> towards<lb/>
my side. The carpet-bag I did<lb/>
not admire, since mine is<lb/>
really a better one. The mus-<lb/>
quitoes! what shall I say!<lb/>
Accept the acknowledg<del>e</del>ments<lb/>
of a grateful heart- They were<lb/>
so lifelike &amp; perfect! How<lb/>
<hi>could</hi> you reproduce them<lb/>
so accurately! The <hi>one</hi> <add>perched</add> on<lb/>
the fence, I recognized, at<lb/>
once-! How could I ever for-<lb/>
get one who had been so<lb/>
very <hi>near</hi> to me! My tears<lb/>
I could not restrain! After<lb/>
wrapping my mosquito-net-<lb/>
ting securely about my head<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01647006"/>
I sat &amp; watched him through<lb/>
its meshes for quite a time-<lb/>
And as I beheld his calm,<lb/>
honest brow, my tears fell<lb/>
thick and fast- So strongly<lb/>
does friendship sway our<lb/>
better nature! Again, I thank<lb/>
you, for this classical painting!<lb/>
Remember that the <hi>future</hi> is<lb/>
before you, &amp; let you motto be<lb/>
&ldquo;excelsior&rdquo;! As I narrated the<lb/>
events of a visit I made, in my<lb/>
last letter, let me tell you, in this<lb/>
one, something of a sailing<lb/>
excursion that I recently took<lb/>
part in. Last saturday, fore-<lb/>
noon, Miss Braddish &amp; her Brother<lb/>
drove over to the Post &amp; extended<lb/>
a kind invitation to Dr Byrne<lb/>
&amp; myself to accompany them<lb/>
on a sailing party, the same<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01647007"/>
afternoon- We accepted, &amp; punct-<lb/>
ually at 2 o'clock, we jumped<lb/>
into our ambulance &amp; were<lb/>
soon at the residence of<lb/>
the young lady<del>es</del> (By way of pa-<lb/>
renthesis, let me say that<lb/>
Mr Braddish is a gentleman<lb/>
of considerable property, being<lb/>
worth something over a mil-<lb/>
lion; has an elegant residence,<lb/>
<add>with</add> beautifully laid out yard, sit-<lb/>
uated right on Long Island sound-<lb/>
owns fine horses &amp; carriages, and<lb/>
has his own sailing yacht-<lb/>
In a word, is a man of wealth &amp;<lb/>
spend his time just as he pleases.)<lb/>
We found awaiting our arrival<lb/>
the following ladies &amp; gentlemen;<lb/>
Miss Emilie Moriac, Miss Eddy, Miss<lb/>
Bowne, &amp; a certain spinster<lb/>
whose name I have forgotten; Mr<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01647008"/>
Bowne, Mr Parsons &amp; Mr Mendellson-<lb/>
Mr Braddish, son &amp; daughter were also<lb/>
among the mumber; so that, all told,<lb/>
we were thirteen souls. Passing<lb/>
down a beautifully turfed em-<lb/>
bankment leading from the house<lb/>
to the water's edge, we were soon<lb/>
embarked, &amp; with a goodly spread<lb/>
of canvass &amp; a propitious breeze,<lb/>
<del>we</del> were soon bowling &amp; bounding<lb/>
over the <hi>bleu</hi> waters of the Sound.<lb/>
Our bark was a gallant one and<lb/>
our companions very pleasant &amp; vi-<lb/>
vacious- It fell to my lot to enter-<lb/>
tain Miss <hi>Emilie</hi> Moriac; and whether<lb/>
the <hi>name</hi> inspired me or not, certain<lb/>
it is that my tongue was never more<lb/>
busy- I actually astonished myself.<lb/>
After sailing about 10 miles, the time being<lb/>
spent in pleasant conversation &amp; singing,<lb/>
&amp; having witnessed a most enchanting<lb/>
sun-set, we turned our barked home-<lb/>
ward, arriving about 8 P.M. As I wended my<lb/>
way to my Post, I could but think how trifling was the pleas-<lb/>
ure of an evening thus spent, compared with the happiness of one<lb/>
moment at your side-</p>
