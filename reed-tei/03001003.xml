Dr. J. H. Johnson,<lb/>
Chairman, Board of Trustees,<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Johnson:</salute>
</opener>
<p>After consultation with the Secretary of War, Gen. Wood,<lb/>
and other friends, I have concluded that, till the canal was completed<lb/>
my duty lay here, and that I should decline your very flattering offer.<lb/>
I cabled you to that effect.</p>
<p>Nothing that could be offered me would be more attractive<lb/>
than the position tendered me by the Board.</p>
<p>The University was established while my Grandfather -- Governor<lb/>
Gayle -- occupied the chair of Governor of the State. Forty years after-<lb/>
ward my father was President. And now, thirty years after my father,<lb/>
the chair is offered to me.</p>
<p>My Mother has been Librarian of the University for thirty<lb/>
years, and still lives there.</p>
<p>During all this time the courtesy and consideration shown to<lb/>
my family have been unfailing both by the Trustees and the authorities<lb/>
of the University.</p>
<p>My Great-grand-father, Grandfather and Father were citizens<lb/>
of Alabama, and lived and died in the state. And my ancestry has been<lb/>
associated with the public affairs of Alabama from the time it become a<lb/>
territory. I was born in Alabama and expect to spend my declining days<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03001004"/>
-2-<lb/>
there.</p>
<p>The position you offer me would have allowed me the<lb/>
association that an absence from the state of thirty years has more<lb/>
or less severed.</p>
<p>Every consideration of sentiment and affection binds me to<lb/>
both Alabama and the University with the strongest sort of ties.</p>
<p>If I had consulted alone my own feelings and wishes I<lb/>
would have accepted your offer without any hesitation. But on the other<lb/>
hand comes into consideration my work here on the Isthmus of Panama.<lb/>
This so far is my life work, and it seems to me to be my duty to remain<lb/>
with the work till the canal is finished.</p>
<p>Will you be kind enough to express to the Board of Trustees<lb/>
my deep appreciation of the honor conferred upon me and my acute regret<lb/>
that I am unable to take up the very attractive work which they lay before<lb/>
me.</p>
<p>With kindest regards, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
