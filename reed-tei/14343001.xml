<salute>My dearest Gran</salute>
</opener>
<p>When the <unclear>Sedgwick</unclear><lb/>
came in without that pre-<lb/>
cious box of dry goods for<lb/>
Louise she nearly threw<lb/>
a fit and her state of<lb/>
mind was not improved<lb/>
by the pessimistic tone of<lb/>
your letter which came<lb/>
yesterday. But this en-<lb/>
dorsement of Capt. Palmer<lb/>
gives her again a ray of<lb/>
hope, &amp; I hasten to send<lb/>
it to you in order that if<lb/>
you have not received it<lb/>
you may inquire for a package<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14343002"/>
addressed to Mrs <hi>Mason</hi><lb/>
as he stated that it was re-<lb/>
turned to that address-</p>
<p>We have had two letters<lb/>
from Mama since her<lb/>
arrival in Lynchburg<lb/>
and she seems to have<lb/>
finished her journey<lb/>
very successfully and got<lb/>
across the City to New<lb/>
Jersey all right in spite<lb/>
of the slip-up about Mason's<lb/>
meeting her- How she<lb/>
did so, she failed to say<lb/>
with that curious epistolary<lb/>
unsatisfactoriness which is<lb/>
a characteristic of the Prescott<lb/>
blood, &amp; of which my father<lb/>
used constantly to complain.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14343003"/>
I hope Mason did not worry himself<lb/>
about the matter, which could not have<lb/>
been helped &amp; turned out all right. I<lb/>
feel much obliged to him for his willing-<lb/>
ness in the matter. We had Hattie Bar-<lb/>
ling &amp; her husband Dr Trotten out to dinner<lb/>
last night and the Burton girls and a<lb/>
couple of young Cavalrymen Mr <unclear>Wessen</unclear> &amp; Mr<lb/>
Long to meet them. Hattie looks quite<lb/>
pretty but is as slim as a reed- They are<lb/>
keeping house on <unclear>Tacon</unclear> St. about fifty yards<lb/>
from the palace &amp; the same distance from<lb/>
Gen Ludlow's old <unclear>Hdqrs-</unclear> which by the way the<lb/>
Dunns now occupy- Well Gran Gen Woods<lb/>
determination to build me a house at Colum-<lb/>
bia Bks seems to have filled Col. Bald-<lb/>
win with a jealous rage, and he has been<lb/>
as nasty as possible about it. The latest<lb/>
development was his designation of the lower<lb/>
end of the garrison for its location just be-<lb/>
cause I wanted the upper end. I told him<lb/>
that Gen. Wood had mentioned the upper<lb/>
end as his preference, to which he replied<lb/>
that that would not change him but rather<lb/>
the reverse. So I reported the matter to Gen-<lb/>
Wood's aide M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Coy saying that I did not<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14343004"/>

particularly case, but de-<lb/>
sired General Wood to<lb/>
know the decision, in case<lb/>
the General did care.<lb/>
I then took occasion to<lb/>
mention to Col. B. what<lb/>
I had told M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Coy.</p>
<p>So yesterday out came a<lb/>
message from the General<lb/>
to put it at the upper<lb/>
end and Col. B. is<lb/>
<unclear>enraged</unclear> accordingly.</p>
<p>It is a pretty hard slap<lb/>
in the face for a Colonel<lb/>
to get, but he invites it by<lb/>
never acting with justice<lb/>
or good faith or kindly<lb/>
&amp; obliging motives.</p>
<pb n="5" id="f14343005"/>
<p>The beautiful Bobs dis-<lb/>
tinguished himself last<lb/>
week by cutting two teeth<lb/>
in three days, one upper<lb/>
&amp; one lower. He is getting<lb/>
to be very smart and<lb/>
cunning. Yesterday when<lb/>
we started out in the car-<lb/>
riage and did not take<lb/>
him he was much insulted<lb/>
and threw his arms about<lb/>
Emma's neck &amp; sobbed, &amp;<lb/>
would not look at us<lb/>
at all when we called<lb/>
him. Emma who is per-<lb/>
fectly devoted to him is<lb/>
always delighted when he<lb/>
turns to her for comfort<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14343006"/>
Please tell Mr Young that we greatly<lb/>
enjoyed his letter and I hope soon to<lb/>
answer it. Louise &amp; Martha have gone<lb/>
to Sunday school.</p>
<p>Goodbye dear Gran with much love</p>
