Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
Mayo Clinic,<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am almost ashamed to answer<lb/>
your letter of April 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> at this late date,<lb/>
and furthermore, I'm afraid this will reach<lb/>
you much too late to be of any use. After<lb/>
my hurried little note of thanks to Mrs. Hench<lb/>
for the beautiful flowers she sent me, I was<lb/>
unexpectedly appointed for an extensive<lb/>
educational survey, as member of the Com-<lb/>
mittee on Social Studies. Your letter came<lb/>
after I left, and though most of my mail<lb/>
was forwarded to our different addresses<lb/>
in the interior, yours remained on my desk<lb/>
with a pile of unimportant school &amp; book<lb/>
correspondence until my return in the<lb/>
latter part of June. Even then, hungry for<lb/>
family-life and the <unclear>babys</unclear> company, I have<lb/>
practically lived out on the sand, at the<lb/>
seashore, trying to relax after strenous<lb/>
months of work, and even more anxiously,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03576002"/>
II Ag to Am<lb/>
to disregard entirely our recent elections (result<lb/>
known in advance) which promise such dreary<lb/>
years for this poor illfated island. We only<lb/>
opened up our home in Vedado on the first of<lb/>
this month. Please accept my excuses. I only<lb/>
hope you have been able to find all the publi-<lb/>
cations you wanted to use in some American<lb/>
Library, and so your work has not been hin-<lb/>
dered by my delay.</p>
<p>I did receive your copy &amp; the original<lb/>
carbon copy of my Father's letter to Dr. Hemmeter:<lb/>
I believe I mentioned it in my short letter to Mrs<lb/>
Hench.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the Walter<lb/>
Reed stamps and the photographs. I have<lb/>
given Mrs. Estevez one of the prints where<lb/>
she <del>was in</del><add>appeared.</add> If you &amp; Mrs Hench come again<lb/>
to Havana soon, as we hope, I intend to<lb/>
take you on a visit to her father's home<lb/>
out in Country Club Park. It is one of the<lb/>
loveliest in these parts &amp; he has some very<lb/>
faithful reproductions &amp; valuable originals<lb/>
of Spanish and Italian <unclear>Hot</unclear>- Mr Aguilera<lb/>
(Mrs. Estevez' father) is probably one of the<lb/>
wealthiest merchants in Cuba though<lb/>
you would never think so, by the way<lb/>
the whole family behaves.</p>
<p>I have not received the photographs<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03576003"/>
III<lb/>
you were going to send me after having reprints<lb/>
made. I hope they have not been caught in<lb/>
the jam of <hi>our</hi> mails during elections. We<lb/>
are still receiving magazines &amp; papers very<lb/>
irregularly. I am in no hurry for them<lb/>
so you may take your time, as I feel<lb/>
they are in safe keeping.</p>
<p>I happened to stop at the old<lb/>
farm where the boxes and trunks <del>and<lb/>
boxes</del> are stored, during my trip through<lb/>
Pinar del R&iacute;o. I managed to rummage<lb/>
through all the conceivable places where<lb/>
those negatives might have been kept. I<lb/>
found hundreds of negatives but not the<lb/>
ones we wanted. In fact there is a picture<lb/>
of a man in an old-fashioned coat &amp; derby<lb/>
on the porch of what might have been<lb/>
Las Animas or Hospital No. 1, whom<lb/>
I am pretty sure is Dr. Carroll. Any-<lb/>
way, I suspect my Mother put away<lb/>
those important negatives in a safer<lb/>
place. And that's the trouble. If ______ I<lb/>
manage to find time before school<lb/>
begins I shall go over what papers<lb/>
are in the house <hi>again</hi> ...... but I<lb/>
don't promise as the heat is pretty<lb/>
awful these days.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f03576004"/>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Were you finally able to do anything with<lb/>
the faded photographs I loaned you?</p>
<p>Well, since I am not being of any fur-<lb/>
ther help, I shall close this belated letter.<lb/>
Please don't hesitate to let me know if I<lb/>
can be of any further use. We are looking<lb/>
forward to seeing you and Mrs. Hench<lb/>
again, sometime, with a better chance to enjoy<lb/>
your company.</p>
<p>Please give her our regards and<lb/>
with best wishes for yourself I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>Estela Agramonte Rodr&iacute;guez Le&oacute;n</signed>.

P. D.<lb/>
I hope you can understand my &ldquo;broken&rdquo;<lb/>
English. If I can help in any way for your<lb/>
paper on Lazear, I promise to do so, <hi>promptly</hi>,<lb/>
if you give me another opportunity.<lb/>
