<title>Letter from Paul L. Tate to Albert E. Truby, June 14, 1953</title>

<p>Tate generally agrees with Truby's interpretation of the check book figures. However, he believes that the cost of yellow fever in the United States was beyond computation in both personal and commercial losses.</p>

General A. E. Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco, Calif.<lb/>
<salute>Dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Many thanks for sending me the preliminary copy of the Camp<lb/>
Lazear Costs Account. It is what I would term as near a<lb/>
perfect break-down of those figures as is possible at this<lb/>
late date. You had no other certain authority to turn to--<lb/>
just your own recollection and the few known facts.<lb/>
I see nothing to add or substract except in the introduc-<lb/>
tory remarks where you refer to myself. I am delighted at<lb/>
your kind reference to me, but we know, eager and willing<lb/>
to help as I am, that I made no contribution to your find-<lb/>
ings.</p>
<p>yes the<lb/>
<unclear>Sen Doc.</unclear> gave<lb/>
me much help<lb/>
<unclear>A E T</unclear></p>
<p>Everything that I deduced from the check-book figures, you<lb/>
had, of course, discovered<unclear>--,,</unclear> and much more. It is sufficient<lb/>
gratification for me to have been asked to assist on this<lb/>
problem, but not worthy of any credit.</p>
<p>You certainly had an intricate and difficult task in seper-<lb/>
ating and properly apportioning all those items, and I con-<lb/>
gratulate you on the logical manner in which it was done.<lb/>
I checked over those figures as well as I could without an<lb/>
adding machine. Simple addition, as you know is the most<lb/>
ticklish of all mathematics--no real way to prove results<lb/>
without a machine. This is what I found:<lb/>
<list type="simple">
<item>All checks are in proper amount and correctly charged and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06507046"/>
(2)<lb/>
accounted for.</item>
<item>A type-key error of check numbers in Par. 1 &amp; 2, Table IX<lb/>
(marked on returned copy)</item>
<item>Table XI, Check No. 74, you have $16.35, which is correct,<lb/>
but the SUMMARY shows $18.35.</item>
<item>Your grand total is: - - - - - - - - -$6,487.23<lb/>
My addition of Checks show: - - - - - - - 6,457.73<lb/>
making a difference of $29.50 too much.</item>
<item>But--Your Table VIII shows total: $586.92<lb/>
My figures - - - - " : 616.92<lb/>
Making difference of $30.00</item>
<item>This makes it just 50&cent; over on your grand total and my check-<lb/>
book totals, and I'll be ding-danged if I'm going to hunt<lb/>
for that extra half-dollar--You can have it!</item>
</list></p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>It is just my personal opinion, but I do not think that Army<lb/>
salaries and maintainence should be included in this as a<lb/>
charge against the Experiment. --They would have gone on just<lb/>
the same. But I do think that gratuities should be included,<lb/>
(that is, those paid at Camp Lazear) as that was a definite<lb/>
part of the cost of the Experiment.</p>
<p>O. K.</p>
<p>They were<lb/>
not in the<lb/>
the 2 group<lb/>
<hi>at Col. Bks</hi><lb/>
So let<lb/>
Hench<lb/>
decide<lb/>
that <unclear>A E T</unclear></p>
<p>As for losses caused by Yellow Fever in the U. S., I think<lb/>
that is beyond all computation. Outside of the deaths and<lb/>
personal losses, the commercial loss was so tremendous it<lb/>
could not even be estimated.</p>
<p>I will<lb/>
ask H to<lb/>
write that<lb/>
<unclear>up</unclear> if<lb/>
he desires<lb/>
to do so.</p>
<p>In New Orleans <hi>alone</hi> in the <hi>one</hi> epidemic of 1878, the esti-<lb/>
mated cost was $10 million, plus $4,500,000. collected in<lb/>
the North.</p>
<p>Coming from Brazil after several days at sea you were held<lb/>
up at N. O. quararantine for two days, and coming from<lb/>
Cuba I've had to stay there 3 days. Think what that means<lb/>
to commercial travellers. The only thing which went through<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06507047"/>
(3)<lb/>
were banana ships, (after crew examination) and the mail,<lb/>
which was fumugated and sent on my rail.</p>
<p>If Yellow Fever had not been conquored, of what use would<lb/>
be the speed of air planes against this quarantine loss of<lb/>
time, which, of course would have been greater?</p>
<p>As I wrote Morrison, Mayor of N. O. there would be none of<lb/>
the wonderful docks and loading facilities in his city<lb/>
today had it not been for the success of the Yellow Fever<lb/>
experiment in Cuba. No, I think it impossible to even ex-<lb/>
timate the tremendous losses which preceeded the Experiment.<lb/>
Well, I'd better get off this subject! But, I've gone<lb/>
through a lot of this Y. F. experience in the South, per-<lb/>
sonally.</p>
<p>I hope that the first part of this letter is of some benefit<lb/>
to you and that my figures are correct. O. K. Thanks</p>
<p>With very best wishes to you and family,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely &amp; Cordially,</salute>
<signed>Paul L. Tate</signed>
Be sure <unclear>by</unclear> let me know if I<lb/>
can assist you further in any<lb/>
way.<lb/>
