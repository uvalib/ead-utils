<p>THE YELLOW FEVER EXPERIMENTS.</p>
<p>The story told in another column of<lb/>
this issue of the work done by the Army<lb/>
Surgeons in Cuba in fixing upon the<lb/>
mosquito the responsibility for the con-<lb/>
veyance of the infection of yellow fever<lb/>
from one human being to another is of<lb/>
the greatest interest to all for whom ex-<lb/>
act experiments pointing to indisputa-<lb/>
ble conclusions have a value which does<lb/>
not attach to speculations. It will be<lb/>
seen by those who follow our synopsis of<lb/>
the report of Drs. REED, CARROLL, and<lb/>
AGRAMONTE to the Pan-American Med-<lb/>
ical Congress, that the tests were made<lb/>
under conditions which left very little<lb/>
ground on which to base a challenge of<lb/>
the results announced. No fact seems to<lb/>
be better established, experimentally,<lb/>
than that clothing, bedding, merchandise,<lb/>
and other objects of great solicitude to<lb/>
the quarantine authorities of this and<lb/>
other ports where something more than<lb/>
a perfunctory system of granting pra-<lb/>
tique to ships from yellow fever ports<lb/>
obtains not only do not convey or im-<lb/>
part the disease but cannot be made to<lb/>
do so. <hi>This fact is not new, but those<lb/>
who have long believed that the disin-<lb/>
fection of yellow fever contaminated<lb/>
fabrics and the like had no more value<lb/>
than an incantation, have lacked the<lb/>
ability to establish their contention on<lb/>
evidence as indisputable as that fur-<lb/>
nished by the tests at Camp Lazear</hi>. It<lb/>
may also be said that the function of the<lb/>
mosquito as the intermediate host for the<lb/>
yellow fever parasite is not a new discov-<lb/>
ery, since its power for mischief in this<lb/>
direction has been suspected and pro-<lb/>
claimed by writers who believed it to be<lb/>
true; but <hi>for the first time the hypoth-<lb/>
esis is established on a basis of strictly<lb/>
scientific demonstration. Such work has<lb/>
more value than the cleverest guessing</hi>.</p>
<p>The reader will naturally ask: In view<lb/>
of these results, what becomes of the<lb/>
theory of quarantine? We are not pre-<lb/>
pared to answer. State medicine is con-<lb/>
servative. It may need some time to<lb/>
change the practice of Governments in<lb/>
this matter, and still longer to disabuse<lb/>
the popular mind of its impression that<lb/>
in the absence of other means of exclud-<lb/>
ing persons and their belongings sup-<lb/>
posed to be charged with infection, the<lb/>
shotgun is a proper means of making a<lb/>
&ldquo;cordon sanitaire&rdquo; effective. The mat-<lb/>
ter has the greatest practical interest at<lb/>
the beginning of Summer, in view of the<lb/>
increasing intimacy of our relations with<lb/>
Cuba and other West Indian islands, and<lb/>
of the importance of encouraging and<lb/>
facilitating trade relations between this<lb/>
country and those south of us.</p>
