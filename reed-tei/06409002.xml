Dear Colonel Hench</p>
<p>As to the name of the artist who painted my<lb/>
portrait for the sala in the Secreteria de Sanidad,<lb/>
I have spent a lot of time looking it up in my diaries-<lb/>
I cannot say it was entirely time wasted, because I became<lb/>
so interested in old memories that I had great pleasure tho.<lb/>
I lost many hours. I found in <unclear>D. VII</unclear> p. 78 that my cousin<lb/>
John Coolidge of the State Dept. who happened to be in Havana,<lb/>
<unclear>work</unclear> with me &ldquo;to the meeting of the Nat. Sanitary Board when<lb/>
<hi>crayon</hi> portraits of Gov. Magoon, Dr. Findlay and myself<lb/>
were unveiled in the sala of the Board, with the usual <unclear>lau-<lb/>
datory</unclear> speeches&rdquo;- March 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1908- This is evidently not the por-<lb/>
trait in oil which you are interested in, and which I am<lb/>
sure was painted later- Of course the Nat. San. Board lost<lb/>
its importance when it was replaced by the Sec. de Sanidad<lb/>
over<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06409003"/>
Ac<lb/>
<unclear>K</unclear><lb/>
y Beneficencia- Whether the <unclear>Secy</unclear> of the new Cabinet<lb/>
position has the same sala as the Old Board<lb/>
I do not know- My somewhat vague recollection<lb/>
is that when the American Public Health Assn-<lb/>
had their annual meeting in Havana in Dec 1911<lb/>
Gen. Gorgas and I were guests of the Nation and<lb/>
one afternoon of the meeting was taken up in a<lb/>
formal meeting of the Assn and the Cuban <del>State</del> <unclear>Secre-<lb/>
teria</unclear> de Sanidad y Beneficia- in which our portraits<lb/>
were unveiled &ldquo;with the usual <unclear>laudatory</unclear> speeches&rdquo;<lb/>
much to the <unclear>disjust</unclear> of members of the U. S. P. H. Assn<lb/>
who wanted to get through with their business and<lb/>
catch the steamer home- My portrait was probably<lb/>
a copy of the Crayon above mentioned- If I find<lb/>
anything more I will let you know- if not it is no <unclear>great</unclear><lb/>
matter- I hope that you will get something of val-<lb/>
ue out of these pages- There does'nt seem to me<lb/>
to be much of value in them-</p>
