<salute>My dear Moran:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was interested to get your letter of the 4th, inclosing<lb/>
the editorial from &ldquo;EL MUNDO&rdquo;, &ldquo;La Gloria de Finlay&rdquo;. I do not read<lb/>
Spanish very easily these days but I think I got the sense of it which<lb/>
was, I think, to urge Cubans to cherish the fame of Finlay as the &ldquo;Yank-<lb/>
ess&rdquo; have done that of Gorgas. I did not get the idea that there was<lb/>
any effort to diminish the fame of Finlay by claiming his work for<lb/>
Gorgas, which would be absurd, but only that Finlay was made to suffer<lb/>
by comparison. I showed your letter to General Ireland who said that<lb/>
Gorgas never discovered anything, but only carried out the Finlay theory<lb/>
when it was made a demonstrated fact by Reed.</p>
<p>Many Cubans, as we both know, feel that we in the United<lb/>
States do not give Finlay his fair share of the credit for this great<lb/>
discovery, and I feel that there is some truth in this, especially among<lb/>
those who are not familiar with Finlay's work.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may recall that on December 22nd, 1900, a dinner<lb/>
was given by 60 of the most prominent doctors of Havana, headed by Dr.<lb/>
Juan Guiteras, to Dr. Finlay and the Reed Board, to celebrate the con-<lb/>
clusive demonstration by the Board of the Finlay theory of the trans-<lb/>
mission of yellow fever by mosquitoes. General Wood was there, Reed and<lb/>
his two assistants, Gorgas and I. I sat on Dr. Finlay's right. Guiteras<lb/>
made the principal speech in which he gave the history of Dr. Finlay's<lb/>
work and that of the Reed Board. He said, as regards the credit to be<lb/>
given to Finlay and Reed, respectively, he thought it exactly like the<lb/>
case of the transmission of malaria by the anopheles mosquito. Manson<lb/>
first gave an authoritative announcement of the mosquito transmission of<lb/>
malaria and gave good epidemiological reasons to support his theory.<lb/>
Major Ronald Ross, of the British Medical Service, afterwards made the<lb/>
laboratory demonstration of Manson's theory, tracing the development of<lb/>
the malarial parasite in the mosquito after it had bitten a case of mal-<lb/>
aria, and then its transmission by the bite of the mosquito to another<lb/>
patient. He said that the scientific world had no difficulty in giving<lb/>
due credit to each of them, and so it should not be difficult to give due<lb/>
credit to Finlay and Reed, each for his part. Everyone present, includ-<lb/>
ing Finlay and Reed, seemed satisfied with this statement of the case, and<lb/>
I have always upheld it both Americans and Cubans. Ill informed people<lb/>
in the United States may fail to mention Finlay and ill informed Cubans<lb/>
may fail to mention Reed, but the fame of each is safe and secure, and I<lb/>
do not worry over partisan statements. I have just refreshed my memory<lb/>
of this dinner by reference to my &ldquo;Diary&rdquo; and I also read there that on<lb/>
January 1, 1901, I went to see Moran at the hospital and was happy to find<lb/>
him out of danger.</p>
<p>Well, you have got me into a long letter.</p>

<salute>Sincerely your friend</salute>

P. S. You are welcome to tell the story of the Finlay-Reed dinner to any one.<lb/>
