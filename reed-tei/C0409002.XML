Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>
Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just received your letter of December 9th in<lb/>
regard to Dr. Walter Reed's work in yellow fever.</p>
<p>I can add but very little to what I have written you,<lb/>
mainly because the information I have is from conversations with<lb/>
my uncle, Dr. Henry Rose Carter, who died in September 1925 in<lb/>
Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>After Dr. Carter's work in malaria, he and Walter Reed<lb/>
began work along the same line to discover the yellow fever<lb/>
carrier. They had mapped out a line of work and experimentation.<lb/>
An epidemic of yellow fever broke out along the south Atlantic<lb/>
and Gulf Coast and Dr. Carter was put in charge of quarantine<lb/>
and whatever health measures he thought proper. Reed continued<lb/>
with his experiments and I think the letter written by Dr. Reed<lb/>
to Dr. Carter, a copy of which I sent you, shows the result of<lb/>
Dr. Reed's work.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter wrote a treaties on the history of yellow<lb/>
fever etc. for the Rockefeller Foundation after he had been<lb/>
incapacitated as assistant surgeon general in public health<lb/>
work; most of his work being done while confined to his bed,<lb/>
his daughter, Laura A. Carter, who later married Admiral<lb/>
Stit<del>h</del><add>t</add>, being his secretary, and knew his work I expect better<lb/>
than anyone else, and did a great deal of the research work<lb/>
for him. She is now also dead. I think Admiral Stit<del>h</del><add>t</add> could<lb/>
give you a good deal of information. Dr. Carter has one son,<lb/>
Dr. Henry Rose Carter, 805 Woodward Building, Birmingham,<lb/>
Alabama. His wife, Dr. Melson Barfield Carter, is at the<lb/>
head of the x-ray work for the University of Alabama and in<lb/>
charge of that work at the hospital in Birmingham. They may<lb/>
be able to give you further information.</p>
<p>Dr. Henry Rose Carter, Sr. disliked publicity and would<lb/>
not allow interviews with newspaper reporters. Dr. Carter<lb/>
spent some time in Peru and in Colombia and I think parts of<lb/>
Chile, making investigations for the Rockefeller Foundation<lb/>
and it is probable that some of his work there may be<lb/>
connected with Reed's work, though I do not know about this<lb/>
as it may be that Reed died before Dr. Carter went to South<lb/>
America.</p>

<p>-2-</p>
<p>I have heard Dr. Lazear's name mentioned by Dr. Carter<lb/>
and his daughter, but I do not recollect the details in regard<lb/>
to him.</p>
<p>If I run across anything which I think may be of<lb/>
interest to you, I will let you hear from me again. There are<lb/>
several boxes of letters stored in Ashland, Virginia. I will<lb/>
endeavor to look through these as I find time and as I say, if<lb/>
I find anything that may be of interest to you, I will be glad<lb/>
to write you.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
