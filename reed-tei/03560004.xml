<salute>My dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been doing some historical researches on the work of Walter Reed<lb/>
and the yellow fever board at Camp Columbia, Havana, in 1900. Colonel Ash and<lb/>
Major H. A. Davis of the Army Medical Museum in Washington have given me much<lb/>
help and last week when I was in Washington they showed me photographs of a model<lb/>
of Camp Columbia made by some Cuban in 1900. This model, formerly at the Army<lb/>
Medical Museum, I understand is now at the Carlisle Barracks. They have a photo-<lb/>
graph of the side of the model and one looking down on the top. Do you still have<lb/>
this model and would it be possible to get a photograph looking down on it from<lb/>
the front? Major Davis thought that you had a staff photographer, who might be<lb/>
willing and able to make this for me. In reciprocity for the great kindness of<lb/>
the staff of the Army Medical Museum in providing me with these various photographs<lb/>
I was delighted to promise them that they will receive copies of the documentary<lb/>
evidence and various photographs that I have collected from various survivors of<lb/>
the yellow fever experiments. As a result of a visit to Havana and elsewhere, we have<lb/>
discovered several very important things.</p>
<p>First of all, the Cuban government has chosen the wrong site of Camp<lb/>
Lazear. The one that they now have marked Camp Lazear is entirely wrong and we<lb/>
found this out just in time, as they had planned to build a memorial building on<lb/>
the wrong site. The site they have wrongly chosen is right across the railroad<lb/>
track from the present military city, which is on the site of Camp Columbia.<lb/>
This railroad track is visible in the model which you possess. On this site is<lb/>
not Camp Lazear but a small group of tents comprising a tent hospital where they<lb/>
brought the victims of yellow fever after they had contracted it at Camp Lazear<lb/>
a mile away. Any help that you can give me will be much appreciated.</p>
