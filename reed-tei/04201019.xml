Dr. Phillip S. Hench,<lb/>

<salute>My dear Doctor:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am sending the copy of your letter <add>of the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to me</add> to Dr. H. R.<lb/>
Carter, Jr. in Birmingham, Ala. asking his permission to send the<lb/>
trukns on to you.</p>
<p>There are three large trunks. You will have quite a task<lb/>
before you, and I know that there is a lot of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; which can be<lb/>
thrown away.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in the chest which I discarded, was mostly<lb/>
social matters in regard to (then) Miss Laura Carter.</p>
<p>She was a <unclear>brilliant</unclear> woman, and was her father's constant<lb/>
attendant when he was confined to his bed, <del><unclear>and</unclear></del> for eighteen months<lb/>
writing the history of Yellow Fever for the Rockfellows, which<lb/>
she completed with the help of Dr. Frost as editor after her<lb/>
father's death. She <del><unclear></unclear></del> presented her father with a certificate<lb/>
of graduation from a business school in ahort hand and typeing on<lb/>
his return home from an absence of three month in field work, and<lb/>
thus not only took his dictation, but secured the reference books<lb/>
from the Library in Washington and reviewed them for her father.</p>
<p>She was called on to make talks in regard to the work,<lb/>
and was very fond of society, and the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; I discarded or rather<lb/>
weeded out was mostly that and social letters, in which I should<lb/>
think you would not care to bother with.</p>
<p>There is such a mass of letters &amp;c. in the <unclear>trunks</unclear> that I<lb/>
would take too long to go through, and hope that Dr. Carter will<lb/>
allow me to send it on as is. <unclear>(</unclear> Lazy, Am I not?<unclear>)</unclear></p>
<p>I will send you copy of the other letter I found from<lb/>
Reed.</p>
<p>I might say right here, that Dr. Carter said that Reed<lb/>
had always been perfectly fair and had always given him full<lb/>
credit for his part in the yellow fever work.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
