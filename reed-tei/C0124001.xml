<salute>Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Having arrived in Washington in accordance with telegraphic<lb/>
orders of January 23, 1899, you are hereby ordered to proceed to<lb/>
Habana, Cuba, <hi rend="sup">x</hi> and thence to other portions of the island, the<lb/>
province of Santiago excepted, at such times as may be suitable.<hi rend="sub">x</hi><lb/>
I have to inclose herewith a copy of General Orders No. 15, is-<lb/>
sued from the Headquarters of the Army, Adjutant-General's Of-<lb/>
fice, in Washington, dated January 20, 1899, embracing an order<lb/>
signed by the President relating to quarantine in Cuba and<lb/>
Porto Rico. You are hereby directed to organize the service con-<lb/>
templated in this Executive Order in the ports of Cuba, the<lb/>
provinve of Santiago excepted.</p>
<p>You are directed first to call <hi rend="sup">xx</hi> upon Major-General John R.<lb/>
Brooke, U.S.A., Governor of the Island of Cuba, with a view to<lb/>
securing his cooperation in the measures about to be instituted.<lb/>
Thereafter you will call upon each of the military governors of<lb/>
the several provinces of the island and also the military offi-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0124002"/>
--2--<lb/>
cers in command of the several ports, particularly General<lb/>
William Ludlow in command of the city of Habana, and Colonel<lb/>
Black, who has also been detailed by the President for duty in<lb/>
that city.</p>
<p>You will provide for the organization of the quarantine<lb/>
service first in the ports mentioned in the Executive Order,<lb/>
with the exception of Santiago to which port and province Pass-<lb/>
ed Assistant Surgeon M. J. Rosenau has been detailed.</p>
<p>You are informed that the disinfecting barge Protector is<lb/>
to be towed within a few days to the harbor of Habana, and that<lb/>
the Bureau, in order to save time, has advertised for proposals<lb/>
to furnish some eight steam disinfecting chambers with boilers<lb/>
and formaldehyd attachments for use at the quarantine stations<lb/>
in Cuba. You will make a specific report to the Bureau concern-<lb/>
ing each port, recommending the kind of plant necessary, i.e.,<lb/>
whether floating or stationary, and if stationary its location,<lb/>
giving diagram so far as possible in illustration thereof.</p>
<p>You are informed that a disbursing officer of the Epidemic<lb/>
Fund is to be appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury for the<lb/>
Island of Cuba. This disbursing officer will be directed to pay<lb/>
bills certified to by the regular quarantine officers appointed<lb/>
at the respective ports, when these officers are regularly com-<lb/>
missioned officers of the Service, or by yourself.</p>
<p>While the Marine-Hospital Service is given the control of<lb/>
quarantine matters, including the payment of quarantine expendi-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fC0124003"/>

tures, it is the desire of the Bureau that the military govern-<lb/>
ors of the several ports, as well as the military governors of<lb/>
the provinces, should be consulted with regard to the equipment<lb/>
and running expenses of the respective ports.</p>
<p>You will keep the Bureau fully informed by correspondence,<lb/>
or cable if necessary, of your procedures under this order,<lb/>
writing a letter at least once a week and oftener if necessary.</p>
<p>That there may be no misunderstanding in the matter, you<lb/>
are informed that you are in charge of all quarantine matters in<lb/>
behalf of the Bureau in Cuba, with the exception of the Province<lb/>
of Santiago, the port of Habana included. With regard to this<lb/>
latter port, your attention is especially directed to the matter<lb/>
of the landing of troops from transports, and some measure de-<lb/>
void of danger from infection of Yellow Fever should be devised<lb/>
for such landing. Your attention is called in particular to the<lb/>
necessity of perfecting arrangements at Habana for preventing<lb/>
the conveyance of Yellow Fever from that port of the United<lb/>
States. These arrangements should be made and put in operation<lb/>
as soon as practicable.</p>
