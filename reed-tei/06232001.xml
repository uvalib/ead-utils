</dateline>
<salute>My dear Major Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You will have received by this time all<lb/>
the clinical data and summery of the autopsy findings con-<lb/>
cerning the case of Sueido.</p>
<p>Last saturday my whole morning was taken<lb/>
up in making a careful inspection of all the fumigation work<lb/>
done in the suspected zone, accompanied by Dr. Guiteras and<lb/>
Dr. Lopez del Valle. The result was very satisfactory and we<lb/>
ascertained besides that Sueido on one of the possible incu-<lb/>
bation days had been on board one of Herrera's fruit stea-<lb/>
mers which ply between Havana, Antilla and Daiquiri. Dr. Hu-<lb/>
go Roberts has been therefore instructed to have that boat<lb/>
fumigated the next time they return to Havana.</p>
<p>The prophylactic measures taken for Suei-<lb/>
ro's case have been the following:</p>
<p>1st...Fumigation of the blocks in which<lb/>
&ldquo;La Perla&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cuatro Naciones&rdquo; are located, as well as<lb/>
the contigious ones. Notwithstanding the fact that those<lb/>
particular <hi><unclear>F&egrave;ndas</unclear></hi> had been previously fumigated (on general<lb/>
<unclear>principals<add>les</add></unclear>) the preceding week.</p>
<p>2nd...Temperatures of all nonimmunes<lb/>
within the suspected zone taken twice a day by Inspectors<lb/>
of the Department.</p>
<p>3rd...Inspection and <unclear>petri<add>o</add>lization</unclear> of<lb/>
all the blocks within the old city limits, that is, between<lb/>
the western boundary line formed by Egido and <unclear>Nonserrate</unclear><lb/>
streets and the seashore.</p>
<p>4th...Vagrants without work or home<lb/>
found in the suspected zone, are taken up and sent to Tris-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06232002"/>
Maj. Kean. (2)<lb/>
cornia for five days' observation, being maintained there<lb/>
at our expense. Approval from the Provisional Governor<lb/>
having been obtained.</p>
<p>5th...Reminders have been sent to all<lb/>
the Havana physicians demanding prompt notification of non-<lb/>
immunes with Dengue or any other fever when the diagnosis<lb/>
of yellow fever cannot be excluded within the first twenty-<lb/>
four hours of their illness.</p>
<p>By my letter to Dr. Amesse dated the<lb/>
19th. inst. of which a copy is herein enclosed, you will<lb/>
see how it was that the quarantine was understood to have<lb/>
been declared against <hi>all ports in Cuba</hi>, and with it you<lb/>
will find a copy of our protest.</p>
<p>Dr. Birmingham in reply to my inqui-<lb/>
ries, has ordered the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A period of nineteen days having e-<lb/>
"lapsed since the onset in the case of yellow fever recent-<lb/>
"ly occurring in Havana, I have today recommended that the<lb/>
"restrictions against the enlisted men of this Army visiting<lb/>
<unclear>QHavana</unclear> (Officers have not been restricted) be removed&rdquo;-</p>
<p>I have today reminded him that Sueiro's<lb/>
invasion was the 7th. inst..</p>
<p>No new case or suspect has occurred<lb/>
in this part of the Island, but today a suspect has been<lb/>
notified at Holguin and Dr. Lebredo starts to night to exa-<lb/>
mine the patient. I shall cable the result of his investi-<lb/>
gation.</p>
<p>I have requested Dr. Thomason to delay<lb/>
his return to Santiago untill Lebredo's report and he has<lb/>
readily agreed to do so and he has written to Dr. Fauntle-<lb/>
roy informing him about this. If as I expect the case at<lb/>
Holguin proves negative of yellow fever, I am thinking of<lb/>
giving to Dr. Fauntleroy again the direction of the mos-<lb/>
quito campaign in Havana. Dr. Church has been poorly with<lb/>
an abcess in the right arm which prevents him from attend-<lb/>
ing to this matter. Dr. Lopez del Valle has been receiving<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06232003"/>
Maj. Kean (3)<lb/>
the <unclear>inspections,</unclear> daily reports and a couple of days ago I had<lb/>
a talk with the Special Inspectors endeavoring to rouse their<lb/>
ennergies in view of the present situation. I think that our<lb/>
prospects of having no other cases of yellow fever are very<lb/>
fair, every one in the Department having taken a lively in-<lb/>
terest in the matter</p>
<p>September 22nd.</p>
<p>Your letter of 18th. inst. just received. General<lb/>
O'reilly's recommendations are already in operation and your own<lb/>
will be carefully attended to.</p>
<p>I regret to say that my congratulations about<lb/>
my dictation are premature for I have not tried it yet.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ratcliff leaves today on the Transport to<lb/>
complete her vacation in the U. S.</p>
<p>Please remember me kindly to General O'reilly and<lb/>
to our Cuban members at the Congress and believe me yours very<lb/>
faithful,</p>
