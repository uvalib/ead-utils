Philadelphia, Pa.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Withington:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciate greatly your letter of January 9, 1941. The second<lb/>
picture of &ldquo;Beaumont and St. Martin&rdquo; (framed) arrived in fine order and is now<lb/>
in my office. I am sorry not to have received from you the picture of Osler<lb/>
similarly signed by the author, but I have the one you sent me already framed<lb/>
in my office. I think these are fine paintings.</p>
<p>I am very glad that you and Mr. Cornwell have not concluded your<lb/>
plans regarding the Reed painting, and would appreciate giving you some data<lb/>
based on three years' investigation of the Walter Reed Army Yellow Fever Board.<lb/>
By separate post, I am sending you an article of mine on the subject which I<lb/>
gave recently at the dedication of the Lazear Memorial Building at Washington<lb/>
and Jefferson College. I would be indeed glad to meet you and Mr. Kellogg,<lb/>
and discuss my investigations in detail, and partly in confidence.</p>
<p>Mr. Cornwell is quite correct. Dr. Carlos Finlay did play quite<lb/>
an important part and I think deserves a place in the painting, but others are<lb/>
more important. To portray the subject adequately yet present a portrait that<lb/>
is historically accurate will be impossible. At no one time, when the crucial<lb/>
experiments were being made, were all of the principal participants together.<lb/>
I think that Mr. Cornwell must be allowed some license, but as the painting will<lb/>
involve not only some medical accuracy but will involve the relationship between<lb/>
the governments and medical professions of Cuba and America, I am very anxious<lb/>
to make some suggestions which I know will please all concerned. Perhaps I am<lb/>
anticipating myself in informing you confidentially that I am trying to arrange<lb/>
the erection of a suitable memorial building to house the small building which<lb/>
is all that remains of Camp Lazear. Such a memorial building could be placed in<lb/>
the most suitable spot in Havana. It is my hope that the original painting<lb/>
might be permanently loaned by your company to this museum, erected to commemorate<lb/>
the conquest of yellow fever.</p>
<p>I expect to be here until the middle of March when I will return<lb/>
to Havana to conclude my investigations. I should like to spend at least a half<lb/>
day with you. Personally, a Monday might be the best day for me, although if you<lb/>
prefer to spend an evening, we could spend a whole evening going over the matter.<lb/>
If this is not suitable, if you will let me know a few days ahead of time I can<lb/>

re-arrange my work so that I can give you a whole morning or a whole afternoon.<lb/>
I hope you are not coming out just to see me. Nevertheless, I am able to give<lb/>
you much information that is not contained in the little brochure sent by<lb/>
separate post.</p>
