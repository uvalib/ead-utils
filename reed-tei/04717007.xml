Mr. Paul Tate,<lb/>
1530 Tyler Street,<lb/>
Berkeley 3, California<lb/>
<salute>Dear Mr. Tate:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received from Miss Bruce the corrected transcription of our<lb/>
interview of June 21, 1954. I have carefully studied it and your old<lb/>
letters to me. As a result, I have written down many, many questions<lb/>
and comments arranged under 113 numbered questions.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it tremendously and be most grateful to you<lb/>
if you would, during the next days and weeks, give me as much of your<lb/>
time and effort as it will take (and it will be a lot, I know) to answer<lb/>
all of these questions. Aside from Lambert (whose memory is poor) and<lb/>
Handberry whom I have not (yet) gotten much out of, you are the only living<lb/>
eye-witness to these stirring events, at least so far as I know.</p>
<p>Now, my main concern is that you will look at this formidable<lb/>
list of questions, throw up your hands in despair, and regard the task<lb/>
as an impossible one. I do wish you would not be panicked by the number<lb/>
of questions I'm sending you.</p>
<p>Please, first of all, read over the entire questionnaire before<lb/>
you try to answer a single question. You will find much overlapping because<lb/>
I wrote them as they came to me and often decided to amplify a question<lb/>
long after I had asked it first.</p>
<p>Although you may, on first reading, think you cannot answer many<lb/>
of the questions, if you mull over the matter, it may be surprising how things<lb/>
may come back to you. I'm hoping my photographs and comments will help to<lb/>
jog your memory. Please don't try to start answering any questions until<lb/>
you have read the whole thing over once or twice and looked at the various<lb/>
&ldquo;enclosures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have a copy of this questionnaire so you can keep this one and<lb/>
make on it whatever scribbled notes you wish so as to help you when you start<lb/>
to dictate or type your answers. Doubtless you can combine in one, answers<lb/>
to more than one question. You have said that you did not think you wanted<lb/>
to use the services of a professional stenographer, such as Miss Bruce, but<lb/>
would prefer to type the answers yourself at home and at your own convenience.<lb/>
I hate to put you to so much trouble. But I agree that it might be much<lb/>
easier for you in the long run. Also, I am worried lest the comprehensive-<lb/>
ness of this questionnaire frighten you off or tire you out. Could you just<lb/>
decide to &ldquo;take it easy&rdquo; in replying and cover just so much ground each day<lb/>
as you have the desire and the time?</p>

<p>I hate to bother you like this. But if you do see fit to help me,<lb/>
you will be implementing, for medical history and for all time, your admiration<lb/>
for your medical colleagues (Reed, et al) who did so much for us all. Also,<lb/>
you will be making a personal contribution which will earn you a place in my<lb/>
book, for I shall certainly refer to you often and thank you publicly and<lb/>
most gratefully.</p>
<p>As for answering these questions, please always number your answers<lb/>
as per the question number. If you can do so, <hi>please keep a carbon</hi> of your<lb/>
answers so that we can correspond further as necessary. But if it is too<lb/>
much trouble for you to make a carbon for yourself, send me your answers, and<lb/>
I will have an ozalid copy of each page (of your answers) made here and return<lb/>
them to you to keep.</p>
<p>You might prefer to wait until you have answered all the questions<lb/>
before sending any answers to me. But I do wish you would send your answers<lb/>
to me in batches or sections, for several reasons. First, I can be digesting<lb/>
your answers as they come along and looking up data which might be helpful to<lb/>
each of us; secondly, if anything happened to you before finishing all of the<lb/>
questions, your unmailed answers might never reach me.</p>
<p>If you choose to pass by the more difficult questions and answer the<lb/>
easier ones first, please do so. Just stick to the appropriate numbers, and I can<lb/>
re-assemble numerically later. In any event, the most of the questions are<lb/>
separate and disconnected.</p>
<p>I wish, of course, that you and I could &ldquo;visit&rdquo; with each other for an<lb/>
hour two daily. Then we could simply converse over this, my secretary could<lb/>
transcribe our remarks, or we could have them on a machine, and no trouble to<lb/>
you. Incidentally, if you thought it impossible to dictate or type answers<lb/>
yourself, would you consider dictating them to a machine? Have you used a<lb/>
tape recorded or any other type? I am so anxious to get your answers to these<lb/>
questions; perhaps we could borrow or rent a machine in your home town so that<lb/>
you could use it at your leisure. But perhaps, as you told me, it would be<lb/>
easiest in the long run, if you just typed two or three pages yourself whenever<lb/>
the mood strikes you.</p>
<p>Believe me, Mr. Tate, I and all of the relatives of these fine men<lb/>
of whom we write, will be most grateful for your help. Please let me know<lb/>
if there is anything I have which you would like to borrow: The Senate Document<lb/>
822, Agramonte's article in Military Surgeon, Kelly's book, or anything else<lb/>
I've mentioned or any photo you may want to see (I have many).</p>
<p>Keep the two current maps of Havana if you wish.</p>
<p>Thanks just loads for the help you have already given me. I only<lb/>
hope you will react to my questions as did Generals Kean and Truby. After they<lb/>
got at it, they found it gave them great pleasure and a great sense of usefulness<lb/>
as they recalled old times and helped me record them.</p>

<salute>Sincerely and gratefully yours,</salute>
