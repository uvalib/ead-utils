<salute>Dearest Mumsie-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of the<lb/>
3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> came Saturday, and the<lb/>
newspaper from father on the<lb/>
same day. It is very good<lb/>
of you to send each of<lb/>
us something for our ward-<lb/>
robe, and we shall appre-<lb/>
ciate the things very much.<lb/>
The list <del>of the</del> for me is<lb/>
especially delightful, for it<lb/>
just hits the things I<lb/>
need most. I saw Major<lb/>
Baker down town last<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14308002"/>
night and told him a<lb/>
bundle was coming for me.<lb/>
I asked him about the<lb/>
package attatchment to<lb/>
the transports, and he<lb/>
said he did not know of<lb/>
it. I have no doubt that<lb/>
the people in New York<lb/>
meant what they told<lb/>
Mrs. Arthur on the subject,<lb/>
but, as long as the <unclear>Q.Ms</unclear>-<lb/>
at this end of the line<lb/>
have not been told of it<lb/>
I don't care to have them<lb/>
feel they are doing me a<lb/>
favor, so please have Helen<lb/>
send my bundle by ex-<lb/>
press. The rate to Havana<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14308003"/>
is very reasonable. 40&cent; for one pound, and<lb/>
then 5&cent; added for each additional pound.<lb/>
Address the package to Quemados, Havana,<lb/>
and then we send in for it. If you have<lb/>
a chance put in some bibs for Martha-</p>
<p>Isn't the news about the Clendenins<lb/>
dreadfully sad. We have heard that Dr. C.<lb/>
was sick four days, and died on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of this<lb/>
month. Our news of Mrs. C. and Miss Bessie<lb/>
is very contradictory so that we feel we do<lb/>
not know anything about them except that<lb/>
they are in New York harbor, but as to whether<lb/>
either or both have fever we can't make out<lb/>
from the reports. At first we heard that<lb/>
they were with Dr. C. when he died, but now<lb/>
we think they must have left before. It<lb/>
has made us all very blue and I cannot<lb/>
but worry about Mrs. C. all the time- Col.<lb/>
O'Reilly told Rannie yesterday that the epe-<lb/>
demic was under control at Santiago. That is<lb/>
a great relief, the poor doctors and hospital<lb/>
corps men have had a terrible time down<lb/>
there. Have I written you that Major<lb/>
Brown is down with typhoid? He is quite<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14308004"/>
Chief Surgeon's Office.<lb/>
<del>HEADQUARTERS SEVENTH ARMY CORPS.</del><lb/>
sick, for he had a walk-<lb/>
ing case, and should have<lb/>
gone to bed some time<lb/>
before he did. Fitz Lee is<lb/>
nearly well. Mrs. Jackson<lb/>
who came down because her<lb/>
husband had typhoid is<lb/>
down with it herself now-<lb/>
It is unfortunate, because<lb/>
her coming was very un-<lb/>
necessary, <unclear>Dr.</unclear> Jackson having<lb/>
had the lightest case on<lb/>
record.</p>
<p>Yesterday after lunch we<lb/>
went in to town to see<lb/>
the Ladds. They are living<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14308005"/>
at the Pyrotecnica Militare<lb/>
which is on Principe hill<lb/>
just between Vedado and the<lb/>
city. They drove us down<lb/>
to the Machina where we<lb/>
found the Custom House<lb/>
launch waiting for us.<lb/>
We went over to Cabanas,<lb/>
and while the men went<lb/>
through that, Mrs. Ladd,<lb/>
Katherine. Martha and I<lb/>
sailed around the harbor.<lb/>
Then we went to the<lb/>
Luizo and had dinner-<lb/>
Altho' we did not leave<lb/>
town until the nine o'-<lb/>
clock train Martha was<lb/>
just as happy and good-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14308006"/>
natured as any of us.</p>
<p>I have not seen Caz for a long time. We<lb/>
did not go in to the Ludlows reception,<lb/>
where I would probably have seen him, and<lb/>
I telegraphed him not to come out yester-<lb/>
day as we had the engagement with the<lb/>
Ladds. Major Sturgis saw him at the Lud-<lb/>
lows and said he seemed in his usual<lb/>
good spirits. What do you suppose was the<lb/>
object of Molly's attack on the poor young man?<lb/>
Our weather is still lovely. I think the<lb/>
mornings are hotter than they were last<lb/>
month but in the house it is comfortable.<lb/>
The rainy season still persists in refusing<lb/>
to be a horror, it does not even rain every<lb/>
day. Col. O'Reilly told Rannie some thing<lb/>
very comforting yesterday so I hasten to im-<lb/>
part it to you. He said that the records<lb/>
show that in former years July was the<lb/>
worst yellow fever month, there was a mark-<lb/>
ed decrease in August, and only half as<lb/>
many cases in September as in August. Here<lb/>
we are well into July and only a couple of<lb/>
cases in Havana. It is wonderful. I think<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f14308007"/>
Chief Surgeon's Office.<lb/>
<del>HEADQUARTERS SEVENTH ARMY CORPS.</del><lb/>
the doctors feel that even<lb/>
if there is an epedemic<lb/>
in the city it can be<lb/>
kept from Quemados, and<lb/>
from the troops out here.<lb/>
The Cuban doctors insist<lb/>
that &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; is never found<lb/>
in Quemados, which may<lb/>
be true, but I don't think<lb/>
any of us put much faith<lb/>
in Cubanos, doctors or other-<lb/>
wise. Don't you worry a-<lb/>
bout me Mumsie, I am not<lb/>
the only woman left in<lb/>
Cuba. Our colony out here has<lb/>
been increased by Mrs. Powers<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f14308008"/>
of the cavalry. She is living<lb/>
right across the street from<lb/>
us, with a Cuban family.</p>
<p>I heard from Caz that<lb/>
Helen had written me<lb/>
about Bert's wedding. But<lb/>
the letter has never come,<lb/>
I am afraid the mails<lb/>
are still rather unsafe-</p>
<p>Martha and Rannie<lb/>
join me in much love<lb/>
to you all</p>
