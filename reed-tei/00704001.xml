what to give a china-boy<lb/>
He is of quite good family- son of a teacher &amp; can<lb/>
write, sends all of his money to his mother<lb/>
&amp; writes home every month - 7 years learning to<lb/>
write.<lb/>

<salute>Dear Ma:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You will get this Xmas day<lb/>
I think or just before. Well we, please<lb/>
God, will have a better Xmas than<lb/>
last year &amp; I would tell you all about it<lb/>
only I doubt if I have time.</p>
<p>May left last Monday to teach at San<lb/>
Rafael -(pronounced, Rafell) about 3/4 to<lb/>
1 hours ride from San Francisco. She wrote<lb/>
to us Saturday, 3 scholars, &amp;c But I will<lb/>
not tell you aught of her because she<lb/>
doubtless wrote yesterday to you herself.<lb/>
I think it is a good place &amp; not a bad<lb/>
salary. She will be much happier in-<lb/>
deed it will be a good thing for her<lb/>
to feel independent -tho' she need<lb/>
never have felt otherwise - &amp; for her to<lb/>
go among people a little more. Her<lb/>
health is again good, she has not had as<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00704002"/>
<del>happy</del><add>pleasant</add> a time as I had hoped her<lb/>
to have with us. Although she says<lb/>
she has enjoyed herself more than<lb/>
since her childhood. I doubt that however.<lb/>
Chas may came &amp; may not, if he can get<lb/>
a cheap ticket, yes; if not, no. $40 is the price of<lb/>
the return ticket &amp; that is a good deal.<lb/>
He wants to come poor fellow &amp; I would<lb/>
wish well to see him, &amp; hope he can come.<lb/>
He is more contented &amp; is not taking things<lb/>
so hard. He will need more money about<lb/>
Jan 1st &amp; I have made arrangements to<lb/>
let him have $75 or $100. He doesn't seem<lb/>
to have gotten into business as fast as I<lb/>
had hoped &amp; yet I really had no data<lb/>
to base an opinion on.</p>
<p>I have had charge of <unclear><hi>Ned</hi></unclear> one day i.e. from<lb/>
1. to 5. P. M. Wednesday. L. Annie &amp; Dedie<lb/>
went in town to get some things, it being<lb/>
Dedie's birth-day. Well, Ed &amp; I fought it out<lb/>
on that line. Only once I rebelled when he<lb/>
wanted to ride, &ldquo;horsey-back.&rdquo; I can't hold him<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00704003"/>
&amp; ride him too. He <hi>can</hi> walk but <hi>won't</hi>. The<lb/>
most reckless child I ever saw. L.' being a little<lb/>
sick yesterday I took him last night &amp; we<lb/>
got through very well. I begin to consider<lb/>
myself quite a baby nurse. He is rather<lb/>
<hi>too</hi> fond of me for comfort, but not for compli<lb/>
ment.</p>
<p>After consideration we have decided that<lb/>
little L.' is big enough to appreciate Xmas.<lb/>
So,- following L.' Dutch traditions - we will have<lb/>
a small Xmas tree, (35 cents) &amp; fix it up, every<lb/>
thing about $2 20/100, not much candy, but pretty<lb/>
things. She is very fond of them &amp; very obser-<lb/>
vant, L. has baked a lot of "cookies" etc<lb/>
We won't have any Xmas dinner, it is<lb/>
more worry to the women folks: &amp; Coon<lb/>
than it is worth to <del>me</del><add>those</add> who cares as<lb/>
little about eating as we do. If<lb/>
Chas does not come we will send<lb/>
<hi>him</hi> a box, for he likes good things<lb/>
May will be home-with us I mean-<lb/>
Friday.</p>

<p>Our china-boy, Ah Coon - (Ah=Mr.),<lb/>
is our despair, he has made about 100<lb/>
small presents - mainly utterly uneatable<lb/>
Chinese eatables- Perserved <add>fruit</add> put up in<lb/>
<hi>salt</hi>. Fish in Oil of Sandal-wood. Perser-<lb/>
ved Bamboo-root, which is certainly eco-<lb/>
nomical. 4 stout men can eat a piece<lb/>
an inch cube for 6 hours &amp; not ex-<lb/>
haust it. Some things. (Ginger &amp; <del>L Chee</del><lb/>
Li Chee nuts) are quite good, He<lb/>
brought L.' a nest of painted boxes. &amp; last sun-<lb/>
day, brought <hi>Ed</hi> a bird (not a <hi>real</hi> bird) in<lb/>
a squeaking cage &amp; L.' 2 vases which, if<lb/>
not smuggled, must have cost 3 or 4 dollars.<lb/>
The squeak of the cage scared Ed - he gets in-<lb/>
to a perfect <hi>panic'</hi> sometimes. Yesterday<lb/>
he bought 4 fancy cake cutters, &amp; a box of <hi>tea</hi><lb/>
16 <hi>lbs</hi> (box &amp; all), for which we paid $4.00<lb/>
better tea than we had paid 75 cents a<lb/>
lb. for. He got the tea underorder, but<lb/>
the other things weigh on us, The obliga-<lb/>
tion of them I mean. One does not know<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00704005"/>
Don't we live differently from what we<lb/>


did Mother, I missed the pleasantest life<lb/>
for me though when I left the country<lb/>
&amp; farming. I doubt if I ever be able to live<lb/>
on a farm again, but it is, for me, beyond<lb/>
all comparison the best life.</p>
<p>We are better off than last Xmas, thank God,<lb/>
L, then was weak &amp; I was anxious about her.<lb/>
She is getting in good health now &amp; spite<lb/>
of some setbacks is slowly getting stronger.<lb/>
I hardly thought Dedie would live then,<lb/>
now she is as strong &amp; tough as one could<lb/>
well see a child, &amp; Ed is big &amp; strong too<lb/>
Chas, I hope, is where he will do well.<lb/>
May is probably doing better than she<lb/>
could have done in V<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>. &amp; I see no reason,<lb/>
if she doesn't worry any more <add>&amp; take exercise</add>, why she<lb/>
should not stay in good health,<lb/>
I feel that I we <unclear>have</unclear> much to be thank-<lb/>
ful for &amp; it <hi>may</hi> even turn out to be<lb/>
an advantage that I came to this coast.<lb/>
We have been having quite cold weather<lb/>
7&deg; below freezing - &amp; yet we have geranium<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00704006"/>
Hearts ease &amp; violets &amp; heliotrope in<lb/>
bloom, although slightly nipped.<lb/>
Can't say a great deal for the cli-<lb/>
mate however.</p>
<p>The Yellow Fever patients are let<lb/>
out into the general ward this mor-<lb/>
ning.</p>
<p>The $10. was sent for <unclear>Mary or</unclear> as you think<lb/>
L. made D. a Mother Hubbard dress<lb/>
about $1.40, &amp; the nurse said that a dozen<lb/>
ladies stopped her in town to talk to<lb/>
her. She is very pretty &amp; bright looking &amp;<lb/>
doubtless the dress became her.</p>
<p>I can send Nan a little money every month,<lb/>
if you think so.</p>
<p>All send love to Gran &amp; Aunt Empsy<lb/>
&amp; to the Cousins, especially <hi>Kate</hi></p>
<p>Did the children get the St. Nicholas<lb/>
for which May subscribed for them?</p>
