<salute>Dear Dr Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>We were so pleased to get<lb/>
your radio talk on ACJH and<lb/>
Cortizone and the inclosed letter<lb/>
of Dr. R.J. Gill to you announcing<lb/>
the award to you and to Dr. Ken-<lb/>
dall of the Passano Award. It<lb/>
is a handsome sum too. There are<lb/>
very few as liberal. Cornelia,<lb/>
(who is now entirely whole and<lb/>
hearty - even her stomach ulcer<lb/>
is now quiessent) thinks that I<lb/>
should return Dr. Gill's letter.<lb/>
I tell her if you wanted it returned<lb/>
you would have marked that on<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06501109"/>
2<lb/>
the letter. I have not been in a<lb/>
hurry to congratulate you because<lb/>
I knew that you were terribly busy<lb/>
and might not have time to read<lb/>
such casual letters as I would<lb/>
write. But a day or two ago I<lb/>
was looking over old papers and<lb/>
I came across two letter-press<lb/>
copies of letters of Gen. Sternberg<lb/>
<add>keep them<lb/></add>
which I thought might interest you.<lb/>
One is written to Major Reed after he<lb/>
had completed his experiments at<lb/>
Camp Lazear, or rather some of<lb/>
them. The other to Prof Chaille at<lb/>
Tulane Univ. was written two years<lb/>
earlier where the <hi>Y. F.</hi> experts had<lb/>
no doubt of the contagious ness of<lb/>
<hi>fomites</hi>. You see he tells Reed that<lb/>

<pb n="3" id="f06501110"/>
3<lb/>
he has no doubt that the mosquito<lb/>
is the <hi>usual</hi> way of conveying the<lb/>
infection, but is not sure that it is<lb/>
the <hi>only</hi> way. Gorgas however, who<lb/>
was in Havana and saw Reed's<lb/>
cases, doubted if the mosquito was<lb/>
the <hi>only</hi> way, <hi>or even the usual way</hi>.<lb/>
He told me this, and was honest<lb/>
enough to put it on record in his<lb/>
<add>final</add> report. Neither one of these <add>letters</add> mentioned<lb/>
the infected bedding experiments,<lb/>
which were of enormous economic<lb/>
as well as epidemilogical importance.<lb/>
They seem to have hit the blind<lb/>
spot in Gorgas's eye, for you know<lb/>
that in Havana Gorgas kept on burn-<lb/>
ing or disinfecting bedding and<lb/>
clothing for months after the Chief<lb/>
Surgeon had forbidden this as unnecessary<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06501111"/>
This having been approved by the<lb/>
Surgeon General before Gen. Wood<lb/>
issued the order. I do not remem-<lb/>
ber ever having seen any allusion<lb/>
in Gorgas's writings to these experi-<lb/>
ments. We had a call from W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi><lb/>
Trevilian Turner, a cousin of mine<lb/>
and a fine man, who is Chief of the<lb/>
freight Div. of the So. R. R. He told us<lb/>
a story of Dr Thomas Kavanaugh of Le<lb/>
Gendre Building New Orleans, La.<lb/>
which Cornelia is anxious that I should<lb/>
repeat to you. It is of a friend of their<lb/>
wife of an Army Officer stationed<lb/>
in Vienna, Austria. She was ill of<lb/>
arthritis (rheumatic). She went to a<lb/>
famous doctor there who cured her.<lb/>
When they were ordered home the doctor<lb/>
gave her a supply of the medicine for<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06501112"/>

WASHINGTON 7, D. C.<lb/>
future attacks, and if she needed<lb/>
more the name of a doctor in<lb/>
New York who could get the prescrip-<lb/>
tion filled. Dr. Kavanaugh has<lb/>
cured other patients with this pre-<lb/>
scription. You can write to Dr.<lb/>
Kavanaugh if you see fit and<lb/>
have time. Mrs. Gen. Frank<lb/>
McCoy wants to meet you and<lb/>
Cornelia would like when you<lb/>
next come to Wash. That you would<lb/>
let her know in advance so she<lb/>
could arrange to have you &amp; the<lb/>
McCoys at lunch or dinner.<lb/>
The pointed slip about the bill in<lb/>
Congress for an appropriation of <del>$</del>350,-<lb/>
000. For eulogizing Walter Reed's work<lb/>
and giving a program of things to be<lb/>
done, leaves me a little cold. I feel<lb/>
sure there is some one behind it who<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06501113"/>
6<lb/>
has gotten up the program and<lb/>
expects to have the spending of the<lb/>
money. He may write to you about<lb/>
it. Rep. Bland of Va. has recently<lb/>
died. It reminds me of a remark<lb/>
in the Kalends &ldquo;When a politician tells<lb/>
you of a plan by which you can get<lb/>
something for nothing, you may be<lb/>
sure that he will get the <hi>something</hi>.<lb/>
and you will get the <hi>nothing</hi>&rdquo;.<lb/>
This letter is already too long. So<lb/>
I will stop here with our good wishes<lb/>
to you and Mrs Hench.</p>
