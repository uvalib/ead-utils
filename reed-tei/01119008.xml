<salute>My dear General Cumming:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Referring once more to the part played by Doctor<lb/>
Carter's observation on the extrinsic period of incubation of yellow fever<lb/>
on Doctor Reed's work, I have found some interesting material. Gorgas in<lb/>
&ldquo;Sanitation in Panama&rdquo; quotes Reed as saying:- &ldquo;We were also much impressed<lb/>
by the valuable observations, ***during the year 1898 by Surgeon Henry R.<lb/>
Carter. *** Other observations made by us since our arrival confirmed Carter's<lb/>
conclusion, thus pointing, as it seemed to us, to the presence of an inter-<lb/>
mediate host, such as the mosquito. *** In view of the foregoing observations<lb/>
we concluded to test the theory of Finlay on human being.&rdquo; Gorgas points out,<lb/>
what we know to be true, that Reed and his Commission had worked along other<lb/>
lines for a considerable time before changing to this plan. In another place<lb/>
Reed says:- "To Dr. Carlos Finlay, of Havana, must be given, however, full<lb/>
credit for the theory of the propagation of yellow fever by means of the<lb/>
mosquito, which he proposed in a paper read before the Royal Academy in that<lb/>
city at tis session on the 14th day of August, 1881.</p>
<p>Kelly, in his book on &ldquo;Walter Reed and Yellow Fever&rdquo;,<lb/>
quotes Reed as saying:- &ldquo;That in view of the splendid work of Ross, Bignami,<lb/>
and others with regard to the propagation of malarial fever, together with<lb/>
the well-known thermal influences intimately connected not only with the<lb/>
epidemiology of the disease in the United States, but also with its endemiology<lb/>
on the Island of Cuba, it was the highest importance that the agency of an<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01119009"/>
-2-<lb/>
intermediate host, such as the mosquito, should either be proven or disproven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot understand how these quotations gibe with the letter of<lb/>
Reed to Dr. Carter, a copy of which you were kind enough to give me. It is most<lb/>
curious that Reed did not give credit to Carter in any of his publications as<lb/>
having been the one who influenced him most in turning to the study of the<lb/>
mosquito.</p>
<p>Since getting home, I have reread the article which I wrote for<lb/>
the American Journal of Public Health on Doctor Carter, and I hope that when<lb/>
it comes out you will show it to Miss Carter. In view of what I have quoted<lb/>
to you, it is impossible for me to believe that Reed's letter was meant to be<lb/>
taken literally. You will note also in that letter the very curious use of the<lb/>
word &ldquo;importance&rdquo; in the last sentence.</p>
<p>In Gorgas' Book you will find it stated, and Reed stated the same<lb/>
thing to me personally, that Reed discussed the matter with Dr. Finlay a good<lb/>
deal before he commenced the mosquito work and was thoroughly familiar with<lb/>
Dr. Finlay's ideas on the subject. In Reed's paper, &ldquo;The Etiology of Yellow<lb/>
Fever, Preliminary Note&rdquo;, given at the Indianapolis meeting of the American<lb/>
Public Health Public Health Association, he says:- &ldquo;We here desire to express<lb/>
our sincere thanks to Dr. Finlay who accorded us a most courteous interview<lb/>
and has gladly placed at our disposal his several publications relating to<lb/>
yellow fever, during the past nineteen years; and also for ova of the species<lb/>
of mosquito with which he had made his several inoculations.&rdquo; These statements<lb/>
do not accord with Dr. Carter's recollections taken down by his daughter that<lb/>
Reed said he did not want to know anything about the mosquito idea, as he wished<lb/>
to proceed to the work with a mind free and unbiased. I must say that I can<lb/>
hardly conceive of any scientific man going at a piece of work without a<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01119010"/>
-3-<lb/>
thorough acquaintance with all that had been done before. Dr. Reed would have<lb/>
been blind and deaf if he had not seen or heard of Dr. Finlay's theory and the<lb/>
work he had done, but we do not have to reason about this matter for Reed says<lb/>
himself that he consulted Dr. Finlay and got everything from him possible.</p>
<p>As I stated before, I am interested only in the historical side<lb/>
of the matter, I had a tremendous admiration for Dr. Carter, had the honor of<lb/>
his friendship for a good many years, have always stated that his work was an<lb/>
outstanding piece of epidemiological investigation, and have always been con-<lb/>
vinced that he was the brains behind Gorgas' success in Panama. You can see<lb/>
then that I am not trying to detract from Dr. Carter's credit.</p>
<p>With much respect, I am,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
