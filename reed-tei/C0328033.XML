<salute>Dear Jack:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am enclosing herewith page 5, Section i (of the MS of Father's<lb/>
book as he left it at the time of his death, <hi>plus</hi> the two inserts (foot<lb/>
notes x and y) which were added, after consultation with yourself, shortly<lb/>
after I went over to Baltimore in the fall of 1926. Foot note x was in-<lb/>
serted in accordance with Father's verbal communication to me, prior to his<lb/>
death, and foot note y, as explaining Father's exact attitude in re-<lb/>
gard to <unclear>Noguchi's</unclear> Leptospira.</p>
<p>At your request, I showed you this page of the original MS, when<lb/>
I was last in Baltimore, at whichtime you said that you would go over<lb/>
that part of the finally edited MS once more before sending it on to<lb/>
New York. Indeed, I presume that you have already done so, and made such<lb/>
changes as seemed advisable. Personally, I wish that we could omit both<lb/>
foot notes and leave the MS as it was at the time of Father's death. I<lb/>
judge, however, that this would not be quite fair, <unclear><del>and,</del><add>[unclear]</add></unclear> although, as you<lb/>
said, it has been necessary to both add and subtract a lot from the MS<lb/>
<unclear><add>l. c.</add></unclear> in the final editing, <del>T</del><add>t</add>his has always been done in the interest of<lb/>
historic accuracy, in which I am as much interested as Father. I do not<lb/>
feel, however, that to insert foot note x, without qualifying it with the<lb/>
gist of what is contained in foot note y would be in accordance with his-<lb/>
toric accuracy. You, however, caring first for the truth and next for<lb/>
Father (as he would have it!) can handle this matter in a manner beyond<lb/>
anything that I can suggest.</p>
<p>I am<del>m</del> too sick to write a decent letter, and too blind to do<lb/>
decent typing. Would be willing to take on both disabilities in an<lb/>
intensified form later rather than be handicapped now, when there are<lb/>
still things to be done about the book. However, I trust that I will<lb/>
&ldquo;pull up&rdquo; within the next few days ...at least enough to &ldquo;last&rdquo; as long<lb/>
as I can be of any use.</p>
<p>With love to the Susans,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly and gratefully yours,</salute>
