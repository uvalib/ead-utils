Dr. Phillip S. Hench,<lb/>
Mayo Clinic,<lb/>
Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have read with a great deal of interest your paper entitled<lb/>
&ldquo;Walter Reed and the Conquest of Yellow Fever&rdquo; in the Journal of Alpha Omega<lb/>
Alpha for May '48. In it I have found a vast amount of information which I<lb/>
did not know about and you have presented it in a very interesting way.</p>
<p>It appealed to me very much because with a considerable number<lb/>
of those to whom you refer I had very pleasant personal relations. Walter Reed<lb/>
himself I never knew, but Carroll was a good friend of mine and I saw him often<lb/>
in the early days of the Association of American Pathologists and Bacteriologists,<lb/>
of which I was a charter member because I happened to be an assistant in the<lb/>
Pathological Laboratory at the Boston City Hospital in the year in which it was<lb/>
organized, 1902 as I recall it. Carroll probably was also an original member<lb/>
and anyhow an early member. Then Jefferson <add>R.</add> K<add>e</add>ane <add>(usually called &ldquo;Ranny&rdquo;).</add> is an old friend of mine,<lb/>
his half brothers and sisters were boyhood playmates of mine in Lynchburg, Virginia,<lb/>
though at that time he had already gone into Medicine and I never saw him in<lb/>
Lynchburg, but there was a period in which he lived here in Boston in which I<lb/>
saw him very frequently. L<del>o</del><add>a</add>zear was an instructor of mine in bacteriology when<lb/>
I was a medical student at the Johns Hopkins and all of the students liked him<lb/>
very much. Gene<add>ral</add> Wood, as you probably know, was a Harvard graduate and had<lb/>
what is not such a pleasant recollection now to the Boston City Hospital, the<lb/>
experience of having been asked to resign as a house officer because he went<lb/>
ahead without orders and did a tracheotomy on a diphtheria patient or at least<lb/>

that is as I remember it. In later years he was a patient of Harvey Cushing<lb/>
and several times was at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, where he eventually<lb/>
died following the last operation on his brain tumor, so I knew him in that way<lb/>
besides meeting him from time to time occasionally in other relationships. It<lb/>
may be of interest to you to know that his brain tumor, which was a very slow<lb/>
growing one, developed <del>considerable</del><add>enough</add> symptoms for the late Dr. Arthur Cabot to<lb/>
explore him a considerable period before Cushing <add>first</add> operated on him. <add>while <unclear>Custinig was in Baltimoire</unclear></add>. Cabot's<lb/>
trephine as it turned out just missed the tumor because the tumor was not<lb/>
immediately under where he had made the trephine wound. Cabot was one of the<lb/>
members of a medical dinner club which met monthly and membership in which I<lb/>
had the good fortune to have beginning back in 1909 with such men as<lb/>
R. H. Fitz, F. C. Shattuck and many others very prominent in the Harvard Medical<lb/>
School as fellow members.</p>
<p>In your paper you refer to Reed as having completed the medical<lb/>
course in a single year. That really was not very unusual. Most of the good<lb/>
man who went to the University of Virginia did it and many of them subsequently<lb/>
went on to other medical schools such as the University of Pennsylvania or<lb/>
Bellevue. Had I gone to the University of Virginia the year after I graduated<lb/>
from college, that is in 1895, it still was possible for a man to do this,<lb/>
though I do not know who was the last one to do it. At that time the medical<lb/>
course was two years. However, I did not go there and spent another year in<lb/>
preparation and entered the Johns Hopkins Medical School in the autumn of '96.<lb/>
His youth, of course, is outstanding, I am sure, in regard to the graduation from<lb/>
the University of Virginia Medicine School, though of course all graduates in<lb/>

those early days were young because very little was required of them in the way<lb/>
of preparation for entrance into the medical school.</p>
