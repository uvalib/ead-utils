<p><hi>HISTORY OF A CASE OF YELLOW FEVER OCCURRED IN PARAHYBA FROM 16 to 24/3/25.</hi></p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th, there arrived an American, at the<lb/>
Hotel <unclear>Luzo</unclear>-Brasileiro, Robert Sherman, aged 50, mining engineer.</p>
<p>He stated on that day that he suffered from headache.</p>
<p>On the 17th, he remained in bed and Dr. Adhemar Londres, who<lb/>
was one of the medical attendants of Mr. O'Donnell (case reported previously)<lb/>
and who made the diagnosis, saw him <add>and</add> on the 18th<unclear>,</unclear> had him removed to<lb/>
the local hospital S. Izabel. On learning this, I with Dr. <unclear>Bi&atilde;o</unclear> and Dr.<lb/>
Londres visited him at 8 a.m. on the 20th and found the following conditions:-<lb/>
<list type="simple">
<item>March 20th - 8 a.m. - Flushed face, conjunctiva injected and icteritic,<lb/>
also neck and chest as far as angle of Louis; gums<lb/>
bleeding, but may be due to extensive pyorrhea.<lb/>
Tongue furred with <unclear>red</unclear> tip and edges. Breath<lb/>
cadaveric. Pains in head general. Nausea only.<lb/>
Temperature 38, 2 C, pulse 82, respirations 20.<lb/>
Blood pressure appeared high, pulse irregular in<lb/>
rhythm. Liver enlarged two fingers breadth below<lb/>
ninth costal cartilage and tender. Slightly<lb/>
wandering in mind and contradictory in statements.<lb/>
Urine bile coloured loaded with albumin. Some<lb/>
petechial spots on the left anterior surface of<lb/>
fore-arm. Stated that he had been vaccinated in<lb/>
Pernambuco but had had small-pox before.</item>
<item>March 20th - 8 p.m. - In statusquo general. Vomited mucus and bright<lb/>
blood. Pulse less pressure and more feeble. Has<lb/>
distinct delirious intervals. Pulse, temperature<lb/>
and respirations were not taken by the doctor.<lb/>
They were attempting to put him in a small sit bath,<lb/>
he weighing 300 lbs. very weak and delirious.<lb/>
I dissuaded them and myself gave him a sponge bath.</item>
<item><unclear>5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> day.. or 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></unclear></item>
<item>March 21st - 4 p.m. - Temperature 38, 8 C, pulse 88, respirations 22.<lb/>
Icterus more marked. More petechial spots. Pains<lb/>
in stomach and nauses. Bleeding from nose and gums<lb/>
at times. More delirious. Urine not conserved.</item>
<item>March 22nd - 10 a.m. - Took &ldquo;Chefe da Prophylaxia Rural&rdquo; together with Dr.<lb/>
Biao and Dr. Londres to see case. More icterus.<lb/>
More petechial spots, urine scant heavily stained,<lb/>
albumin thick. Casts granulated and epithelial.<lb/>
Pains marked in muscles. Pulse weak and irregular,<lb/>
in rhythm. Very nauseated and occasional attempt<lb/>
at vomiting. There was an aortic systolic murmur<lb/>
heard best over the junction of the right third<lb/>
costal cartilage with the manubrium sterni and<lb/>
extending upwards and outwards towards the clavicle<lb/>
(No stethoscope available).</item>
<item>March 22nd - 8 p.m. - Temperature 37, 2 C, pulse 84, respirations 22.<lb/>
Quite delirious. Gave him enema, tarry result.<lb/>
Pulse very weak. Icterus more marked.</item>
<pb n="2" id="f01224018"/>
<item>8.</item>
<item>25/3/1925.</item>
<item>March 23rd - 4 p.m. - Temperature 99, 4 F,, pulse 100. Comatose. With<lb/>
twitchings of arms still protopathic sensibility<lb/>
marked. Not urine passed in 30 hours.</item>
<item><p>March 23rd - 8 p.m. - Passed urine, dark, about 100 ounces (I did not<lb/>
see specimen). Skin clamy. Pulse very low pressure<lb/>
96. Temperature 100 F. No vomiting. Comatose.<lb/>
Pupils sluggish. Muscular twitchings of arms<lb/>
and semi-sterterous breathing.</p>
<p>This would appear to be a severe case in a bad subject.</p></item>
<item>March 24th - 4 a.m. - Died at 4 o'clock.</item>
</list></p>
<p>Because of the indefiniteness of the man's statements, because<lb/>
at first he was very suspicious of being in hospital and being visited by<lb/>
so many doctors, and as I find he was a well known gambler and made his<lb/>
living by that means, his movements were somewhat indeterminate. So far,<lb/>
he definitely arrived from Itabayanna on the 16th March complaining of<lb/>
headache. He stated he was there from the 12th to the 16th having been<lb/>
in Recife and Campina Grande. Later I find that he had been in Parahyba<lb/>
from the 24th to the 27th of February and from there had gone to Ita-<lb/>
bayanna, where he stated, he remained two days.</p>
