Dr. A. S. v. Mansfelde, Treasurer,<lb/>
Nebraska State Medical Association,<lb/>
Ashland, Nebr.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of recent date, which outlines the plans you<lb/>
propose for the increased pension of Mrs. Mabel H. Lazear, is very<lb/>
welcome.</p>
<p>We are in accord with your view that Congress should also<lb/>
grant a proper pension to the widow of Major Carroll.</p>
<p>This Association is perfectly agreeable to the introduc-<lb/>
ing of the two Special Acts in the House of Representatives by<lb/>
your Congressman, Hon. Edmund H. Hinshaw, and in the Senate by Hon.<lb/>
Philander C. Knox and Hon. Charles Dick, our sole desire being to<lb/>
put the legislation in such hands as to make certain its early en-<lb/>
actment. It will be our pleasure and privilege to support these<lb/>
measures.</p>
<p>We are also of the opinion that the Special Act which<lb/>
gave Mrs. Walter Reed a pension should be used for the two widows<lb/>
and their children. The only question in our mind is as to the<lb/>
amount of the pension. In his &ldquo;Memorandum For the President&rdquo;,<lb/>
dated Aug. 30, 1906, Brigadier-General R. M. O'Reilly, Surgeon-<lb/>
General, U. S. Army, referring to Dr. Jesse W. Lazear, says:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;His widow's pension should be increased<lb/>
to $100. a month x x x&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="2" id="f02920002"/>
<p>Dr. A. S. v. Mansfelde,</p>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>In view of this specific recommendation from the Medical<lb/>
Division of the War Department, it might be well to consider whether<lb/>
the pension specified in the Bill should not be in accord therewith.</p>
<p>We note your statement that in all probability the<lb/>
National Legislative Council of the American Medical Association at<lb/>
its forthcoming meeting will vote to stand sponsor for the Bills in<lb/>
question. It will be of material assistance if the various county<lb/>
medical societies, at the instance of the American Medical Associa-<lb/>
tion, adopt resolutions calling on the respective Congressmen to<lb/>
support and work for the passage of the legislation presented at the<lb/>
request of your organization and this Association.</p>
<p>On Dec. 5, 1906, at the time the pension for Mrs. Reed<lb/>
was pending, President Roosevelt transmitted the following message<lb/>
to Congress:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inclosed <xref id="f02920005">papers</xref> are transmitted to the<lb/>
Congress in the earnest hope that it will take suitable<lb/>
action in the matter. Major Reed's part in the experi-<lb/>
ments which resulted in teaching us how to cope with yel-<lb/>
low fever was such as to render mankind his debtor, and<lb/>
this nation should in some proper fashion bear witness<lb/>
to this fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;papers&rdquo; represented the &ldquo;Memorandum for the Presi-<lb/>
dent&rdquo;, prepared by Surgeon-General O'Reilly, referred to above.<lb/>
In view of the President's interest, thus shown, it is our inten-<lb/>
tion to request that he transmit another Message to Congress speci-<lb/>
fically calling attention to the services rendered by Dr. Lazear<lb/>
and Major Carroll. From the conversation the writer had with<lb/>
Surgeon-General O'Reilly and Major Ireland we feel that their act-<lb/>
ive co-operation and valuable assistance can be counted upon.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Bills have been introduced we shall<lb/>
communicate with The Merchants' Association of San Francisco, with<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02920003"/>
Dr. A. S. v. Mansfelde,<lb/>
- 3 -<lb/>
which our relations are very friendly, and with the New Orleans<lb/>
Board of Trade, suggesting the adoption of resolutions urging the<lb/>
California and Louisiana delegation in Congress to vote for the<lb/>
increased pensions.</p>
<p>All the people of the Pacific Coast and those of the<lb/>
Gulf Coast, as much so as those living along the Atlantic seaboard,<lb/>
and the mercantile community in particular, owe an everlasting<lb/>
debt of gratitude to the members of the Commission which conducted<lb/>
in Cuba the mosquito experiments.</p>
<p>The saving to trade and commerce alone by the control of<lb/>
yellow fever is incalculable. We feel, certain, therefore, that<lb/>
the commercial organizations of the sections named will be eager<lb/>
to do all in their power to induce the Federal Government to provide<lb/>
for the proper support of the families of Dr. Lazear and Major<lb/>
Carroll.</p>
<p>We enclose herein, as requested, copies of the draft of<lb/>
bill which you sent us. We think it important for Congressman<lb/>
Hinshaw to be prepared to introduce the measures as soon as Congress<lb/>
convenes. We also suggest that both he and you at once get in<lb/>
touch with Senators Knox and Dick, keeping us posted as to the<lb/>
progress made.</p>
<p>Awaiting with interest full advice as to the action taken<lb/>
at the meeting of the National Legislative Council on the 10 prox.,<lb/>
we remain, with assurances that you may feel at liberty to convey<lb/>
to your organization our willingness to co-operate to the fullest<lb/>
possible extent in the desire that the National Government fittingly<lb/>
express the sentiments of the people as to the noble sacrifice, in<lb/>
