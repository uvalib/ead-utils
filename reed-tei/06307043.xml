<title>Letter from Jefferson Randolph Kean to Philip Showalter Hench, November 17, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Kean thinks that Gorgas did not begin organizing &ldquo;mosquito brigades&rdquo; on Feb 4, 1901, the date of Reed's lecture on yellow fever in Havana. He believes that Reed abandoned the B. Icteroides theory, in July of 1900, and was ready to investigate the mosquito theory by August 1.</p>

<salute>My dear Dr Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>The express man brought last<lb/>
Friday 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the package containing<lb/>
Truby's memoir, his letter to me of Aug 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi><lb/>
(extract<del>s</del>) Carbons of your letter to him of<lb/>
Nov. 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> and your good letter to me of the<lb/>
10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- Today came the package of<lb/>
reprints of your Hygeia article which<lb/>
I am delighted to get- It is much<lb/>
more impressive printed consecutively<lb/>
and with its strong blue cover makes<lb/>
an inspiring appearance. I think<lb/>
you are very generous to give me<lb/>
so many of them and I am delib-<lb/>
erating whether I will send them<lb/>
off to relatives and friends right away<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06307044"/>
2<lb/>
with the compliments of <hi>No. 7.</hi> at<lb/>
Christmas a month hence.</p>
<p>I am glad to know that you are<lb/>
through with your Rheumatism Review.<lb/>
How you can conduct so important<lb/>
a magazine as that and give so<lb/>
much time and thought to the <hi>Episode</hi><lb/>
is more than a one track mind like<lb/>
mine can comprehend.</p>
<p>I am glad to know that you have<lb/>
sent off my bunch of papers to<lb/>
Truby. I had a fine letter from<lb/>
him this morning in which he<lb/>
said that he had not yet received<lb/>
them and was expecting them-<lb/>
His letter was dated Nov. 10 so he<lb/>
had them probably last Friday-<lb/>
You saw didn't you the photostat<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06307045"/>
3<lb/>
of G. O. no. 6. Div. of Cuba, Dec. 21 1900<lb/>
which Gen Ireland got for us-<lb/>
He sent one to Truby and I think<lb/>
one to you &amp; gave me one. It is the<lb/>
order that Walter Reed referred to in<lb/>
the postscript of his letter to Dr. L.<lb/>
O. Howard- I am pleased that you<lb/>
looked up the interesting little<lb/>
article of Gen. Winter's, with my note<lb/>
appended, as to the date when Gorgas<lb/>
began his yellow fever work in<lb/>
Havana- The statement that he<lb/>
began it Feb. 4 is manifestly a<lb/>
slip of Gorgas's pen as that was the<lb/>
date when Reed read his famous<lb/>
paper &ldquo;Etiology of Yellow Fever: An addi-<lb/>
tional Note&rdquo; before the Pan Amer Med<lb/>
Congress in Havana Feb. 4 - 7 1900 with<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06307046"/>
4<lb/>
see p. 87<lb/>
with its eleven Conclusions which,<lb/>
as I heard Dr. F.F. Russell say, is<lb/>
remarkable in that not one of them<lb/>
has been disproved in all the years<lb/>
since- Gorgas says in his final Report<lb/>
to Gen. Wood, July 12, 1902 that he<lb/>
did not believe that mosquito trans-<lb/>
mission was &ldquo;even the ordinary way<lb/>
of transmitting the disease&rdquo; -(p. 236)<lb/>
I am very sure that he did not<lb/>
rush out of the hall where the Con-<lb/>
gress was sitting and begin to<lb/>
organize mosquito brigades that day-</p>
<p>He told me the same thing when<lb/>
I tackled him to support Reed's<lb/>
paper at the meeting- I went to<lb/>
Wash. just before the meeting and<lb/>
wanted Reed to have the backing<lb/>
of his Confreres.<lb/>

2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
I have read and made comments on<lb/>
the extra copy of your letter of comments<lb/>
to Truby of Nov. 2- I agree with them<lb/>
in the main- There is one error of<lb/>
Truby <del>of</del> which you overlooked on page<lb/>
32. vis that Reed had disposed of the<lb/>
Sanarelli claim when he was in Cuba<lb/>
in <add>May</add> 1899- I think I wrote you that<lb/>
he was sent down to investigate an<lb/>
outbreak of fever at the Cavalry Camp<lb/>
at Puerto Principe (Camaguery it is called<lb/>
now)- That was out of my baliwick and<lb/>
of course out of Gorgas's as his activities<lb/>
were limited to Havana It was in<lb/>
eastern Cuba. He soon spotted it as<lb/>
our old enemy typhoid- I find in<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06307048"/>
6<lb/>
my diary that he &amp; Major Arthur came<lb/>
out to see me on May 4 at Quemados<lb/>
before he went to make his inspection<lb/>
So I recommended that Truby omit<lb/>
that paragraph. I think that the<lb/>
Preliminary Note shows that Reed<lb/>
disposed of B. Icteroides in pages 57 &amp;<lb/>
58 in July 1900 &amp; was ready to take<lb/>
up the mosquito by Aug 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> The page<lb/>
numbers refer of Course to the Senate<lb/>
Doc. no. 822 Yellow Fever- As we have fre-<lb/>
quent occasion to make reference to<lb/>
that useful Compilation suppose we<lb/>
agree hereafter to call it Sen. Doc. Y. F.<lb/>
See Page 46- Strength of troops in the Dept<lb/>
I find that you have inserted in your<lb/>
Questionnaire <hi>of Cuba</hi>. It was <hi>not</hi> Dept of<lb/>
Cuba but Dept. of Province of Havana and<lb/>
Pinar del Rio-</p>
<pb n="7" id="f06307049"/>
<p>Hench.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>This is a clumsy title and a con-<lb/>
fusing one, as it did not include<lb/>
The City of Havana which was a<lb/>
separate Military Dept. but did include<lb/>
Marianao, Guanajay &amp; the other<lb/>
provincial towns which were in<lb/>
Gen Lee's command &amp; of which I<lb/>
was Chief Surgeon whose report is<lb/>
quoted in p. 46- I have found much<lb/>
of interest in your questionnaire and<lb/>
it has sent me off to look up things<lb/>
several times- Your very natural ques-<lb/>
tion at Chapter I gave me a sad smile.<lb/>
There were 192 doctors in the Army in 1898<lb/>
the same as when I entered the Army in<lb/>
1884. This was quite inadequate for the<lb/>
medical service in time of peace<lb/>
and as the law did not allow any<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06307050"/>
Ac<lb/>
K<lb/>
8<lb/>
more the deficiency had to be made<lb/>
up by <unclear>employing</unclear> Contract Surgeons<lb/>
at $125.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> a month. When Volunteer Troops<lb/>
were raised as in 1898 they brought in<lb/>
their Volunteer Surgeons with them<lb/>
some very good some very bad and<lb/>
many indifferent- We did not get<lb/>
Reserve Med. Officers until 1908 these<lb/>
gave us a means of expansion for war<lb/>
which we did not have in 1898- The<lb/>
Surgeon General would have been very<lb/>
happy to take in more men in 1898<lb/>
if the law allowed, but the Med Corps<lb/>
was very proud of their high standard.<lb/>
Well I must stop &amp; begin a letter to<lb/>
Truby, your letters are always suggestion<lb/>
and full of interest- Many thanks for the<lb/>
reprints and cordial regards.</p>
