<p>Hench discusses who was present when Moran was bitten by a mosquito. He believes the experiments themselves were meticulously done, but the records were either poorly kept or poorly preserved.</p>

<p>-2-</p>
<p>P. S. Let me give you the results of my efforts to determine just who<lb/>
were present when Moran was first subjected to the experiments in Bldg. 2. Do you<lb/>
have Senate Document 822, the official compilation of the yellow fever work? On<lb/>
pages 10, 86 and 100 of this document it mentions two controls only being on Side A<lb/>
(the mosquito-free side). These two controls were apparently non-immune volunteers<lb/>
but they have never been identified. Moran doesn't recall who they were. On page<lb/>
100 Reed says that the <hi>two controls</hi> continued to sleep in that room at night. On<lb/>
page 99 Reed mentions <hi>two controls</hi> and <hi>one other non-immune</hi> who were on the opposite<lb/>
side of the screen from Moran. Apparently this &ldquo;<hi>other non-immune&rdquo;</hi> was Reed himself.<lb/>
Apparently he merely entered the mosquito-free side of the room briefly for the pur-<lb/>
pose of seeing Moran bitten. This data I found in Agramonte's Scientific Monthly<lb/>
article, Dec. 1915, on page 235 (bottom) where it says, &ldquo;During this time <hi>two other<lb/>
men and Major Reed</hi> remained in the other compartment, separated from Moran....etc.&rdquo;<lb/>
(This is why Miss Hallock had three figures drawn in the left box of the diagram<lb/>
on p. 21 of the enclosed Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's pamphlet. But the<lb/>
events pictured in Figures 1 and 3 on p. 21 never occurred, despite Gorgas' garbled<lb/>
version given on p. 243 of the Senate Document).</p>
<p>see also Reed's letter to<lb/>
General Sternberg of Jan 1 pp. 224 &amp; 225<lb/>
Sternberg Biography- </p>
<p>Can you keep on this?</p>
<p>But in Miss Reed's manuscript I found still another version of the in-<lb/>
cident. In the letter written by Reed to his family supposedly dated <hi>Dec. 26,</hi> 1900<lb/>
Reed describes Moran's experiment and says, &ldquo;I stood with Dr. Carroll and Dr. Ames<lb/>
on the other side (of the screen) at the place marked &ldquo;B&rdquo; and saw the insect light..<lb/>
etc. Bed marked &ldquo;B&rdquo; is being occupied by a <hi>non-immune</hi> who sleeps within one foot of<lb/>
the screen, breathing the same air as in room with bed &ldquo;A&rdquo; (infected room). <hi>This<lb/>
young non-immune</hi> is quite well, but the young fellow 'i.e. Moran) who went in on the<lb/>
21st was suddenly stricken today at noon (Just <hi>four days</hi> after he entered and was<lb/>
bitten) with a sharp attack of what promises to be yellow fever....etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obviously there is an error. The supposed date of this letter is Dec.<lb/>
26 but I imagine the date has been misread and was really Dec. 25. Reed would hardly<lb/>
have made a mistake in dating a letter on Christmas Day and yet the letter <hi>must</hi> have<lb/>
been written then because (1) he speaks of Dec. 21 and then <hi>this noon,</hi> four days<lb/>
later..etc. (2) also a glance at the official record of Moran's case with his fever<lb/>
chart, etc. shows that Moran took sick (really) on Christmas Day, had a fever of<lb/>
104 that afternoon but did <hi>not</hi> have a fever that high on the 26th.</p>
<p>One must conclude that there may have been, not two but perhaps five<lb/>
persons in the mosquito-free side of Bldg. #2 when Moran was being bitten on the<lb/>
other side. These were Drs. Reed, Carroll, Ames and at least one and probably two<lb/>
non-immune volunteers. Why Reed should only mention one (&ldquo;this young non-immune&rdquo;)<lb/>
in the letter to his family where everywhere else it speaks of two non-immune<lb/>
volunteers I do not know. It's just one more of the scores and scores of contra-<lb/>
dictions I've already found in the various official and unofficial records of the<lb/>
experiments. One is almost tempted to complain that although the results of the<lb/>
experiments were clear as crystal and the experiments themselves meticulously done,<lb/>
the records regarding incidental details were rather <hi>sloppily</hi> kept (or poorly<lb/>
remembered later).</p>
<p>Reed had no clerical<lb/>
help and did all of his work with a<lb/>
pen - Most of his records are clean and<lb/>
concise with few errors. Most mistakes<lb/>
were made later copying and with<lb/>
very poor copy <unclear>reading</unclear>. The Senate Document<lb/>
is full of errors-</p>
