<p>Sanitation in Cuba.</p>
<p>One of the most gratifying results<lb/>
o the present occupation of Cuba<lb/>
by the American forces, is the re-es-<lb/>
tablishment of a high order of san-<lb/>
itation. Although a stupendous un-<lb/>
dertaking, the army medical officers,<lb/>
during the first intervention brought<lb/>
order out o chaos and a good hy-<lb/>
gienic condition out of what was a<lb/>
putrid city. While doing this in<lb/>
Havana, none of the other import-<lb/>
ant places of the island were neg-<lb/>
lected. When the republic of Cuba<lb/>
was established one of its primal<lb/>
obligations was to maintain the<lb/>
hygienic conditions in which the<lb/>
Americans left the country. This<lb/>
important duty was overlooked and<lb/>
the conditions soon fell into a very<lb/>
bad state.</p>
<p>Upon the return of the American<lb/>
army to Cuba in 1906 they found<lb/>
that Cuba had only escaped a<lb/>
scourge of sickness because of the<lb/>
natural healthfulness of the coun-<lb/>
try and not because the sanitation<lb/>
had been kept up. It was discov-<lb/>
ered that the work had to be begun<lb/>
from the ground up again and Major<lb/>
Kean was immediately put on the<lb/>
job as a likely man to reconstruct<lb/>
that department. What he has had<lb/>
to do and to contend with has been a<lb/>
sore trial for that gentleman. It is<lb/>
said the stegomyia has not given<lb/>
him the greatest trouble, but the<lb/>
multitude of political pests which<lb/>
have besieged him for places has<lb/>
made life a burden and has hindered<lb/>
his work tremendously. It is un-<lb/>
derstood that he has not always had<lb/>
his way in things, but has had men<lb/>
thrust upon him, because some pol-<lb/>
itician recommended him regardless<lb/>
of the man's fitness for the work he<lb/>
had to undertake. Under the condi-<lb/>
tions it is thought Major Kean and<lb/>
his immediate assistants deserve high<lb/>
encomiums for the splendid work<lb/>
they had done in re-establishing the<lb/>
health o the island.</p>
