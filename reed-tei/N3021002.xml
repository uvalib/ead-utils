THE EVENING SUN, BALTIMORE,<lb/>
Pertinent Portraits<lb/>
</opener>
<p>GEORGE W. GOETHALS</p>
<p>There is a particular thing about<lb/>
George W. Goethals' handling of the<lb/>
canal job that tops all other considera-<lb/>
tions and which has been heretofore<lb/>
overlooked. This is his sticking to it<lb/>
from the moment he assumed command,<lb/>
in 1906. This is the real diagnosis of<lb/>
his success.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the true<lb/>
motive of Wallace's for getting off the<lb/>
job, or of the collapse of the Stevens<lb/>
era, there remains the fact that there<lb/>
was an underlying vein of opinion that<lb/>
the American handling of the canal<lb/>
would meet with the same fate of scan-<lb/>
dal--if not in a greater degree--as the<lb/>
regime of the French.</p>
<p>Whether he stuck from innate deter-<lb/>
mination, or because--bearing in mind<lb/>
the traditions of the service--he real-<lb/>
ized that it would be an irreparable<lb/>
blow to his military career, matters lit-<lb/>
tle. Both incentives probably influenced<lb/>
his actions more or less.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>But he persevered and gave the per-<lb/>
manence, the stability to the organiza-<lb/>
tion that was needed at that time, and<lb/>
needed woefully. For no one knows<lb/>
better than the 1905 and 1906 and 1907<lb/>
men how easily they might have been<lb/>
led to other fields--at least away from<lb/>
the Panama field.</p>
<p>And no one knows better than the<lb/>
men of the early days of the American<lb/>
handling how they felt that the task<lb/>
was not an eight or ten year one, but<lb/>
a twoscore year job. They had their<lb/>
misgivings, and justly. No one but<lb/>
the worker of those days can appreciate<lb/>
the terror that the fever put into the<lb/>
men. Successfully to see their compan-<lb/>
ions' places vacant each new morning<lb/>
put the dread into them all.</p>
<p>Even then they all had mild phases of<lb/>
the fever, which, combined with the<lb/>
early system of sanitation and the lack<lb/>
of wholesome food at the messhouses,<lb/>
was sufficient to throw the &ldquo;shakes&rdquo; into<lb/>
any man.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Many looked on the original creation<lb/>
of the Isthmian Canal Commission as a<lb/>
monumental joke, and a mere bailiwick<lb/>
for otherwise &ldquo;lame-ducks&rdquo;--and end-<lb/>
less, potential, gorgeous pork-barrel of<lb/>
pickings. In Goethals' demands for more<lb/>
men and more money there appeared to<lb/>
many only the opportunity of rewarding<lb/>
political service at home.</p>
<p>In 1907 Goethals was begging for a<lb/>
paltry $14,000 to enlarge and better<lb/>
equip the shops at Gorgona, for the re-<lb/>
pair of the steam shovels and mechanical<lb/>
equipment. And with the chances<lb/>
against him, he was pleading for five ad-<lb/>
ditional steam shovels.</p>
<p>This merely suggests--though elo-<lb/>
quently--the difficulties he encountered,<lb/>
aside from the personal irritations of the<lb/>
commissioners themselves, who sat in<lb/>
the Washington office as long as they<lb/>
consistently could.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>The resignations of Wallace and<lb/>
Stevens may have been, as hinted at the<lb/>
time, one of the manifestations of the de-<lb/>
sire of the transcontinental roads to<lb/>
thwart the project. Or they may have<lb/>
been induced by the petty interference<lb/>
on the part of the original canal board;<lb/>
or by the disappointment at finding ir-<lb/>
revocable the requirement that the chief<lb/>
engineer give his personal supervision<lb/>
on the Isthmus.</p>
<p>Stevens' unexpected action in getting<lb/>
off the works, following so closely on<lb/>
Wallace's quittance--after Wallace had<lb/>
been the subject of such a string of com-<lb/>
mendation on his determination, and<lb/>
Stevens had received even a higher rat-<lb/>
ing in tenacity and stick-to-itiveness--<lb/>
had a depressing and disrupting effect<lb/>
on the canal workers.</p>
<p>And it is not exaggeration to say that<lb/>
back in the comprehensions of the two<lb/>
chief engineers lay the real truth of<lb/>
their going; a truth that could not but<lb/>
reach the workers--that neither Wallace<lb/>
nor Stevens believed the canal project<lb/>
feasible, however much money might be<lb/>
poured into the enterprise. A failure<lb/>
would schedule their reputations for a<lb/>
warping; for it is difficult to imagine<lb/>
that either Wallace or Stevens would<lb/>
have willingly surrendered such an op-<lb/>
portunity for fame and constructive<lb/>
achievement had he not felt the task to<lb/>
be a superhuman one.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Now that the canal is an accomplished<lb/>
fact, one can only conjecture what their<lb/>
feelings are, what regret is theirs, what<lb/>
anathema to unrecognized opportunity,<lb/>
what execrable lack of forehandedness<lb/>
and foresightedness.</p>
<p>But Goethals--Lieutenant Goethals<lb/>
that was, an obedient disciplinarian,<lb/>
with not even the rating of a full regi-<lb/>
mental body--he accomplished the feat.<lb/>
He drove the impossible to the feasible.<lb/>
He builded from the bench-mark of per-<lb/>
sistence. Summed up, his engineering<lb/>
ability will be found to have had the<lb/>
least to do with the result, his executive<lb/>
ability to have had as scant a share in<lb/>
it. He himself gives free credit to pre-<lb/>
vious planning for the operation of the<lb/>
&ldquo;simultaneous level&rdquo; working in Cule-<lb/>
bra Cut; he allows former Division Engi-<lb/>
neer of the Central Division Louis<lb/>
Rourke the credit for the intricate track<lb/>
layout for the &ldquo;serving tracks&rdquo; and<lb/>
dumping trackage; to Col. H.H.Hodges,<lb/>
second in command, he gives unqualified<lb/>
praise for the designing of the lock<lb/>
system.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Patience, bulldogedness, tenacity--<lb/>
whatever term is used--was the key-<lb/>
stone, the grand motif. Deep in his heart<lb/>
Goethals must have realized his direct<lb/>
impotence, but also he must have real-<lb/>
ized and appreciated and must have been<lb/>
guided by the one compelling impulse.</p>
<p>It was the scintillating crux of the<lb/>
problem, in itself a veritable achieve-<lb/>
ment of genius. It was the Napoleonic<lb/>
one of mere mass: just fire as many<lb/>
men and as many dirt trains and steam<lb/>
shovels onto the job and into the job<lb/>
as the people at home will stand for,<lb/>
and more than they will stand for will-<lb/>
ingly. And keep firing them in. Some-<lb/>
thing will have to happen. It will cost<lb/>
money and it will cost men; but keep<lb/>
filling up the gaps. Increase the rein-<lb/>
forcements; hang onto the line:</p>
<p>It was the Germanic spirit of '70-71<lb/>
reincarnate; the spirit that saw past<lb/>
Spicheren and the Saarbruck setbacks<lb/>
to Metz and Sedan; to the <unclear>ever-concen-<lb/>
tering</unclear> files about Paris-sur-la-Seine.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Goethals' persistence and earnestness<lb/>
impressed the commissioners finally--as<lb/>
well as our nation--with the sincerity<lb/>
of his efforts and plans and his innate<lb/>
leadership; and by 1909 the spirit of ac-<lb/>
complishment was visible to all. Some-<lb/>
thing had happened.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful patience that<lb/>
glimpsed the clearing away of the Isth-<lb/>
mian chaos, the leveling of the hills,<lb/>
the disposal of the unimaginable bulk<lb/>
of spoil; that foresaw the rise of the<lb/>
mile and a half dam across the Chagres'<lb/>
plain; that grasped the controlling of<lb/>
the fearful torrential rains and Chagres'<lb/>
floods to a man-serving utility.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful patience that<lb/>
withstood the terrible, constant strain,<lb/>
to &ldquo;get from out and under.&rdquo; It was<lb/>
supreme Goethals patience. H. L. W.</p>
