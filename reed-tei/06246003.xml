Colonel Jefferson R. Kean, M. C.,<lb/>
U. S. Expeditionary Forces,<lb/>
France.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yours of August 25th has just been received.</p>
<p>Our present authority for Ambulance Sections is 129.<lb/>
Forty are to cover American sections on duty in France, and<lb/>
129 sections to be furnished from the United States. Nine<lb/>
additional sections have recently been authorized by the Sec-<lb/>
retary of War.</p>
<p>We have just gotten a cablegram from General Pershing,<lb/>
asking us not to send more than 20 sections for use with the<lb/>
French Army; that they did not need any more. We have about<lb/>
50 under orders for France, but to comply with this cablegram<lb/>
from General Pershing, we have asked that all but 8 of this<lb/>
50 be held for further orders. His cablegram also states<lb/>
that he needs unattached men to fill out the sections he is<lb/>
taking over in France. We will send them over from Allentown<lb/>
as soon as we hear how many are wanted. The Chief of Staff<lb/>
has cabled for information on this subject.</p>
<p>The Marshall is entirely mistaken as to what the French<lb/>
Mission asked for. I was present at several of the conferences<lb/>
between the Secretary and the Mission, and it was finally settled<lb/>
that they would like to have 160 sections, their idea being that<lb/>
these sections would take entire charge of the transportation of<lb/>
the wounded for the whole French Army, and in that way, utilize<lb/>
their own men elsewhere. General Vinal, Military Attache here,<lb/>
is taking up through the Embassy the matter of the misunderstanding<lb/>
and I imagine it will soon be corrected.</p>
<p>If General Pershing asks it, I have no doubt the Secretary<lb/>
will authorize as many sections as you need to take over the<lb/>
American contingent in France. Everything is ready here for<lb/>
shipping this whole contingent now, and all that you have to do<lb/>
is indicate the number wanted, up to the total of 169 sections,<lb/>
and we can furnish you just as many unassigned men as you wish.</p>

<p>Col. J.R. Kean</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>9/14/17.</p>
<p>Whenever you want anything, get General Pershing to add it<lb/>
to one of his cables, and I will do my best to get it for you.<lb/>
For instance, if you want authority for taking over 43 sections<lb/>
in France, get General Pershing to ask it. The Chief of Staff<lb/>
does not like to authorize anything unless he knows it is done<lb/>
with General Pershing's approval.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>W. C. Gorgas</signed>.
