<p>Jose Antonio Viviesca, 28 years of age, citizen of Piedacuesta<lb/>
and living in Rionegro where he had been working for more than five years<lb/>
as a day laborer on various haciendas.</p>
<p>Past history negative as heriditary diseases. The data which<lb/>
refers to the beginning and the evolution of the present illness are as<lb/>
follows:</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the fifteenth (15th) of July the patient com-<lb/>
plained of headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting nor could he stand on his<lb/>
feet or rest in bed as he had lost his sense of equilibrium.</p>
<p>On the two following days 16 &amp; 17 the symptoms were increased and<lb/>
black vomiting set in as well as black stools. On account of this it was<lb/>
determined to send him to the hospital where he arrived on the morning of<lb/>
the 18th at 10.00 A.M. Immediately on arrival at hospital he was placed<lb/>
in bed under a mosquito net.</p>
<p>Physical examination at this time showed a subicteric color more<lb/>
marked in the conjuctivae; anxious and shallow breathing; depositions of<lb/>
black vomit at the corners of the mouth; traces both black and haemorrhagic<lb/>
in the nostrils and the gums receded from the teeth and bloody. Axillary<lb/>
temperature 40 C. Pulse filiform and weak. At that time no further examina-<lb/>
tion was made. The patient entered into agony accompanied by convulsions and<lb/>
expired in a few moments or a few hours (2) after having arrived in the village,<lb/>
(Rionegro) or at twelve oclock on the day 18th of July.</p>
<p>At four oclock of the same day an autopsy was performed showing<lb/>
the following:</p>
<p>The subictericic tint had become frankly ictericic. The sub-<lb/>
cutaneous tissues were well colored yellow. On opening the abdominal<lb/>

2<lb/>
cavity the intestines were found greatly distended and congested in the<lb/>
upper part. The stomach contained a great amount of black blood. The<lb/>
mucosa of the stomach showed a great number of haemorrhagic plaques. The<lb/>
liver, specimen of which is sent in bottle #1, was of normal size. Some<lb/>
parts were dark red and others the color of &ldquo;cafe con Leche&rdquo;. On section<lb/>
the borders of the cut showed haemorrhages.</p>
<p>The kidneys were greatly congested both on the surface and the<lb/>
interior.</p>
