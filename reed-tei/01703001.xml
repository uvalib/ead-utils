<salute>My own, little sweetheart;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I could but<lb/>
smile when I read the first<lb/>
few lines of your letter- In<lb/>
writing to you, I had begun my<lb/>
letter by deploring the delay in<lb/>
receiving yours; &amp; lo! behold,<lb/>
in commencing yours, you have<lb/>
given expression to the same<lb/>
thought- Now, at first sight, I<lb/>
regarded this as a wonderful<lb/>
coincidence, but I soon found<lb/>
that I was entirely mistaken,<lb/>
and was inclined to be vexed<lb/>
for not arriving at a true<lb/>
solution, at once- It only<lb/>
goes to show, (what I have<lb/>
all along contended for,) that<lb/>
<hi>you</hi> and <hi>I think alike</hi>! Now<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01703002"/>
do congratulate me on this wonderful discovery!<lb/>
Yet, after all; it is not very wonderful, for, I be-<lb/>
lieve it is natural for you <add>&amp;</add> me to entertain the<lb/>
same thoughts- I simply want to be congratu-<lb/>
lated for having so <hi>clearly established</hi> the<lb/>
fact. Taken in this connection, it is rather re-<lb/>
markable that your letter, although written on Fri-<lb/>
day, did not reach me till <hi>Wednesday</hi>. So that,<lb/>
all things considered, we will have to agree<lb/>
to <hi>not</hi> disagree. In answer to your inquiries<lb/>
concerning my health &amp; the danger of contracting<lb/>
Small-Pox, I am happy to tell you, my little<lb/>
darling, that I am weighing 150 lbs, &amp; to assure<lb/>
you that I am in no danger of getting sick.<lb/>
It is true that up to the present time, we have<lb/>
had nine (9) cases of the disease on the Post, all<lb/>
of which are confined to children, and although<lb/>
I attend to them, I do not have the least fear of the<lb/>
affection; and if I never have to <del>your</del> under-<lb/>
go any severer trials than attending to<lb/>
to a dozen cases of Small-Pox <add>at a time</add> for the rest of<lb/>
my days, I shall be only too happy,<lb/>
Suppose I should contract it! Ah! would you<lb/>
be glad to welcome a poor, miserable, ugly being<lb/>
back to Murfreesboro? I am ugly enough, at<lb/>
present (not fishing for compliments, my darling)<lb/>
to answer all useful purposes, but to have<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01703003"/>
this ugliness increased by a hundred horrible<lb/>
pits on my face, would you not shudder and<lb/>
turn away your gaze? What think you?<lb/>
Pardon me for calling up these uninviting pic-<lb/>
tures; and if you will excuse me, I'll seek a<lb/>
more lively topic. I am not surprised to<lb/>
learn, my darling E., that Prof. Sharpe is so gal-<lb/>
lant- I knew his failing in this respect, &amp; hence<lb/>
took great pains to leave<del>s</del> <add>you</add> under the protec-<lb/>
ting wing of so attentive a gentleman. You<lb/>
need not thank me, my darling,- I am only too<lb/>
happy, at all times, to look to your pleasure.<lb/>
But really, when you tell me that you cannot<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01703004"/>
turn your head in church with-<lb/>
out &ldquo;catching the Professor's eye&rdquo;,<lb/>
really this is <hi>too much</hi>. It does<lb/>
not astonish me, in the least,<lb/>
that the Professor should look<lb/>
at you<del>r</del>, for during our long<lb/>
acquaintance, he has often<lb/>
confessed with blushes, &amp; that<lb/>
modesty which is so becoming,<lb/>
that he could never resist<lb/>
the temptation of looking at,<lb/>
or to use his own language,<lb/>
&ldquo;of casting a sly peep at<lb/>
a <hi>pretty girl</hi>-&rdquo; In vain, has<lb/>
he struggled to overcome this<lb/>
tendency, but <add>to</add> no purpose have<lb/>
his good efforts tended- Hence<lb/>
that he should look at you; <hi>you</hi><lb/>
the <hi>prettiest</hi> girl that Mur-<lb/>
freesboro ever boasted of,<lb/>
among all her charming<lb/>
damsels, this doesn't sur-<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01703005"/>
prise me; but that <hi>you</hi> should be looking<lb/>
at the <hi>Professor</hi> so much, this is a little unex-<lb/>
pected- Ah! I shall have to write to him &amp; tell<lb/>
him to take care or else some fair nymph<lb/>
will entwine him in her net. I shall have<lb/>
to tell him what the Poet has sung about<lb/>
this very little village. I am inclined to think<lb/>
that you have seen the quotation &amp; <add>will</add> recognize it, at<lb/>
once. Still it is just as applicable &amp; to repeat it will<lb/>
do no harm. This is what he said-</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Ah! thou hast daughters, my little village,</l>
<l>Maids famed for wondrous ken,</l>
<l>Whose daily task it is to pillage</l>
<l>The conquered hearts of men.</l>
</lg>
<p>- - - -</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And much I pity the heedless swain</l>
<l>Who comes within thy walls,</l>
<l>Thinking that he'll be free again</l>
<l>To roam through other halls;</l>
</lg>
<p>- - - -</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>What though he laughs at Cupid's dart;</l>
<l>So the rock laughs at the wave</l>
<l>That, swelling higher, bids it part</l>
<l>And seek a watery grave.</l>
</lg>
<p>- - - -</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And he, full soon, will feel the power,</l>
<pb n="6" id="f01703006"/>
<l>Which these shy damsels wield,</l>
<l>For though he were <hi>their king</hi>, this hour,</l>
<l>The next, he'll <hi>tribute</hi> yield!</l>
</lg>
<p>This, and much more, of<lb/>
a like nature, I'll send him in order to put<lb/>
him on his guard- But of this, more anon.<lb/>
If Miss Annie Vaughan has arrived in your town,<lb/>
please give her my very best regards &amp; tell her to<lb/>
be sure to stay till I come- Remember me kindly<lb/>
to your Sister &amp; mother- Believe me, my darling,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Ever your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
