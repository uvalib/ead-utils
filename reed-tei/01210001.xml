<p>Memo to Chief Sanitary Engineer, G. H. Hazlehurst<lb/>
relative to inspection of Gambusia development ponds, Cherokee<lb/>
Basin, August 21-22, 1924, by Epidemiologist T. H. D. Griffitts.</p>
<p>Pond No. 13 - Liberally supplied with gambusia, all<lb/>
sizes. Pond covered with black scum, no flotage and little<lb/>
vegetation. Water running freely around dam; dam in good con-<lb/>
dition. Out of 32 dips, collected 5 Anopheles larvae, none above<lb/>
three-fourths grown.</p>
<p>Pond No. 14 - Water low, banks bare. In masses of<lb/>
moss Anopheles taken every 3 or 4 dips, only one full grown<lb/>
larva found here. Liberally supplied with Gambusia. Twenty-<lb/>
nine Anopheles larvae taken in 23 dips.</p>
<p>Pond No. 1 - Liberally supplied with Gambusia. Much<lb/>
fallen bullrush and algae, breeding now producing Anopheles<lb/>
quite freely. All sizes of larvae. Twenty full grown larvae<lb/>
and 8 pupae collected. The development from larvae and pupae<lb/>
taken from Pond No. 1 was as follows: Four <hi>Anopheles quadri-<lb/>
maculatus.</hi></p>
<p>Pond No. 2 - Located about 40-feet above Pond No. 1.<lb/>
Almost completely covered with small aquatic vegetation algae<lb/>
and potomogeton. Many larvae or uranotaenia and only 4 small<lb/>
Anopheles larvae were collected. Many gambusia noted but not<lb/>
as many observed as in Pond No. 1.</p>
<p>Pond No. 3 - Liberally stocked with gambusia. Upper<lb/>
portion overgrown with grass and considerable amount of pine<lb/>
tag flotage. Twelve full grown Anopheles larvae taken in 40<lb/>
dips. Pond in good condition. One <hi>A. Quadrimaculatus</hi> develop-<lb/>
ed from collection made here.</p>
<p>Pond No. 5 - Liberally supplied with gambusia - only<lb/>
light Anopheles breeding (1 full grown larva and 1 pupa collected)<lb/>
Water hot and almost completely covered with scum.</p>
<p>Pond No. 18 - Until recently this pond has been dry.<lb/>
It was completely filled at the time of inspection. No gambusia<lb/>
seen and no Anopheles breeding.</p>
<p>Pond No. 24 - Water low; no flotage, contains willows<lb/>
and burr grass. Gambusia plentiful. Only two small Anopheles<lb/>
larvae found.</p>
<p>Pond No. 4 - Near Jerry Dennis' house; 14 large<lb/>
Anopheles larvae and 3 pupae collected in 30 minutes. Found<lb/>
generally in pine tags and vegetation. Fairly well stocked<lb/>
with gambusia. No Anopheles found in barn of Jerry Dennis.<lb/>
Development from collection at Pond No. 4 was as follows:<lb/>
Seven Quadrimaculatus; two punctipennis.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01210002"/>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>Pond No. 25 - Pond has overflowed recently. Water<lb/>
muddy, practically no flotage and no vegetation. Stream enter-<lb/>
ing pond breeding Anopheles freely - probably Punctipennis.<lb/>
Very few minnows in this pond.</p>
<p>Pond No. 6 - Six first molt Anopheles larvae collected;<lb/>
very few gambusia.</p>
<p>Pond No. 8 - Much small bullrush and overfallen vege-<lb/>
tation covering a good portion of the pond, breeding profusely<lb/>
and from the number of large larvae and pupae apparently consider-<lb/>
able production is taking place. Liberally supplied with gambusia.<lb/>
Gulledge sawmill 200 yards distance where 150 people will be camped<lb/>
shortly. The development from collection made was as follows:<lb/>
Seventeen <hi>Quadrimaculatus.</hi></p>
<p><hi>Note:</hi></p>
<p>This pond is producing Anopheles Quadrimaculatus in<lb/>
sufficient numbers to be of decided importance in the transmission<lb/>
of malaria if there should be carriers in the vicinity, and this<lb/>
is not improbable in a sawmill gang. This pond should be thorough-<lb/>
ly oiled once every ten days during the remainder of the season.<lb/>
It is an excellent Gambusia developing pond, therefore, oiling is<lb/>
recommended in preference to draining it.</p>
<p>Pond No. 10 - Liberally stocked with gambusia. Collect-<lb/>
ed 10 full grown larvae and 3 pupae in 13 minutes amongst over-<lb/>
fallen bullrush, grasses, etc. Development from collection was as<lb/>
follows: Two <hi>Quadrimaculatus</hi>, 3 <hi>Crucians</hi>. There is a sawmill<lb/>
located 1/4 mile from this pond. It is said that no people are<lb/>
housed at the sawmill. There is no other occupied house near the<lb/>
pond.</p>
<p>Pond No. 11 - Fairly well stocked with Gambusia. No<lb/>
aquatic vegetation or flotage. Only small larvae collected here.</p>
<p><hi>Note:</hi></p>
<p>Ponds Nos. 1, 4, 8, and 10 are producing <hi>Quadrimaculatus</hi><lb/>
freely and to avoid danger of malaria transmission from mosquito<lb/>
development in these ponds, it is advisable that they be oiled<lb/>
thoroughly once every 10 days during mosquito season.</p>
