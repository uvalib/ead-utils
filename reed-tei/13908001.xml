<salute>My darling Sister;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your welcome letter has<lb/>
been received and deserves more than a<lb/>
postal card in reply. Well really it<lb/>
seems impossible that I have been so<lb/>
negligent and lazy as to permit a whole<lb/>
year to go by without writing my big<lb/>
Sis so much as one line. Cares of mar-<lb/>
ried life, I assure you, my dear Madam!<lb/>
Increased responsibility thrust upon<lb/>
my shoulders- Wife and children to look<lb/>
after -- no time for frisking with the frol-<lb/>
licksome peer, etc, etc,; if you can only<lb/>
be induced to swallow such a<lb/>
high-sounding excuse- If not, I have another<lb/>
Terribly hot climate -- very relaxing to the<lb/>
physical fibre -- conducive to the &ldquo;slumber-<lb/>
-ferous&rdquo; condition- At other times, busily<lb/>
engaged in wiping the beads of pearly per-<lb/>
spirations from my marble brow- Old<lb/>
lady &amp; the two youngest children continually<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f13908002"/>
fretting- necessitates my getting up at night<lb/>
&amp; wondering in the gloom for a match-<lb/>
my toe comes in violent contact with my<lb/>
mahogany bed-post- result, on my back<lb/>
for a week, etc, etc- All of this by way of<lb/>
metaphor, however- Now, joking aside, I<lb/>
am the logiest man living at present- I<lb/>
know not how to account for this except<lb/>
it be that I have the smartest and most<lb/>
energetic wife that ever lived- As an<lb/>
illustration of the latter, she has just remarked<lb/>
that she began a letter to you more than a<lb/>
week ago, &amp; up to the present time, has got as<lb/>
far as Camp Lowell. Oh! we <hi>are</hi> a team<lb/>
and the finest children you ever laid eyes<lb/>
on- of course I refer to Emerline &amp; myself.<lb/>
She's a &ldquo;boofer Omsey&rdquo; &amp; I am <add>a</add> &ldquo;feet Man-<lb/>
tee&rdquo; -- all feet- We left the English language<lb/>
about one year since &amp; now speak an<lb/>
unknown tongue- A specimen of our<lb/>
new language - &ldquo;Oozes peetning&rdquo;? Answer, &ldquo;meezes&rdquo;. &ldquo;Oozes-ub&rdquo;? answer, &ldquo;oozes&rdquo; etc<del>h</del><lb/>
very simple indeed- &ldquo;Children cry for it&rdquo;-<lb/>
will enclose complete vocabulary on receipt of 50 cents.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f13908003"/>
Having begun a new page, will, with your<lb/>
permission, take up a new train of thought<lb/>
Emili<lb/>
Well, you know that my old lady &amp; I were torn<lb/>
asunder on May 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, 76 and after 6 months of<lb/>
sighs &amp; tears (and protestations that no<lb/>
other human beings were wer so cruelly<lb/>
de<add>a</add>lt with, we<del>re</del>) <add>we</add> rushed into each others<lb/>
arms with a scream &amp; a clash, on<lb/>
the evening of November 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, at 8 O,clock,<lb/>
in the great &ldquo;Palace Hotel,&rdquo; San Francisco,<lb/>
California. And then like the children of Israel.<lb/>
we &ldquo;sat down &amp; wept&rdquo;. &amp; my mustache had<lb/>
grown to such an extent during our sep-<lb/>
aration, that my old lady was not satisfied<lb/>
that I was the right fellow, until she had<lb/>
takened a tape-measure &amp; measured <del>my</del><lb/>
the length of my head. Then she was convinced<lb/>
that it was either myself or a mule! With<lb/>
which happy conviction we both fell to<del>o</del><lb/>
on a broiled chicken- We tarried in San<lb/>
F. just one week &amp; thence came by Steamer<lb/>
to San Diego, &amp; thence by private conveyance<lb/>
to Camp Lowell, a distance of 500 miles-<lb/>
Took us about 23 days-camped out<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f13908004"/>
every night- Used camp stools for dinner-table<lb/>
had our butter served on the top of a yeast pow-<lb/>
der box, &amp; fairly luxuriated- Crossed the great<lb/>
Colorado desert -- a vast expanse of sand just<lb/>
100 miles wide where we crossed- got caught<lb/>
in a terrible sand storm- Sand so thick that<lb/>
the sun was obscured &amp; couldn't see 30 feet<lb/>
ahead of us, etc-, finally reached Camp Lowell<lb/>
safe &amp; sound, &amp; just <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>720 out of pocket- But<lb/>
&ldquo;do thyself no harm for we're all here&rdquo;-<lb/>
At some other time, my dear Sis, I'll write you<lb/>
concerning this far off clime &amp; tell you many<lb/>
strange things- I reserve particulars till<lb/>
we meet again- Tell Miss Jennie, after<lb/>
you have given her my best love, that<lb/>
I often think of her, &amp; that I could tell her<lb/>
some terrible stories about Indians that<lb/>
would keep her awake all night- Nita<lb/>
I suppose, has just about reached home when<lb/>
this letter arrives- Kiss her and all the others- Es-<lb/>
pecially my most dutiful regards to the latest<lb/>
Edition- &ldquo;Emerly&rdquo; sends much love &amp; vows that<lb/>
she'll write soon- Love to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B. and believe me,<lb/>
my dear Sister,</p>
<closer>
<salute>your most affectionate brother,</salute>
<signed>Walter,<lb/>
of Arizona</signed>.
<seg>
P.S. Have<lb/>
not named the<lb/>
baby yet-<lb/>
Think we'll call<lb/>
it &ldquo;Bony part&rdquo;<lb/>
after its father.<lb/>
no more-adieu,<lb/>
W. of A.<lb/>
</seg>
<seg>
P.S. No. 2. Your<lb/>
letter was just<lb/>
25 days in coming-<lb/>
Should have reached<lb/>
us in 12 days-<lb/>
W. of A.<lb/>
