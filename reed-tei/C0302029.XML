Mr. H. B. Richardson<lb/>
Inspector General of the Sixth Zone.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In reply to your letter of the 21st instant which was duly<lb/>
received, I take pleasure in communicating to you, as I have already done<lb/>
verbally, that on that day I was called to give medical assistance at the<lb/>
house located on Belizario Dominguez Calle opposite number 449. There<lb/>
and at three o'clock in the afternoon I found a patient whose name is<lb/>
Luis V. Corona in a state of agony. His pulse not perceptible in the<lb/>
radial, his sweaty, wasted and pained features indicated the severity of<lb/>
his condition. I noted that his abdomen was only slightly tympanized.<lb/>
The patient had constant vomitings, which, according to what I was told,<lb/>
were at first yellowish in color, later greenish, and when I saw them,<lb/>
dark bloody color. I was shown some intestinal evacuations of dark bloody<lb/>
color. On the following day a person called at my office for the death<lb/>
certificate and he told me that the above mentioned Corona had died at<lb/>
6:30 P.M. of the same day in which I had seen him, that is, three hours<lb/>
after my only visit. On asking the person who called for the death certi-<lb/>
ficate whether or not the cadaver had turned yellowish, he replied that it<lb/>
had turned completely yellow.</p>
<p>Information given to me by the family of the patient on the day<lb/>
of my visit showed that he became very much worse after the injection of<lb/>
arsenas quinine administered on the 20th, the day before his death.<lb/>

I was also told that he drank heavily and that during the five days of<lb/>
his sickness the fever had been continuous and that he had suffered from<lb/>
frequent but not periodical chills.</p>
<p>With this data I diagnosed the case as suspected yellow fever.<lb/>
Please note that I say only suspected.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
<signed>(Signed)Ciro Hurtado.</signed>
<seg>
P.S. As the time was very short, I gave you and Dr. Galindo a verbal<lb/>
report of the case. I am glad that you were collecting part of the liver,<lb/>
to confirm our diagnosis. I am writing to ask you to please let me know<lb/>
the result of the liver examination when you receive the report from Mexico.<lb/>
Yours truly,<lb/>
(Signed)Ciro Hurtado.<lb/>
