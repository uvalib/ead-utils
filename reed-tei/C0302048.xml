<salute>My dear Col. Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>We arrived in Bogota on the 7th after a hot trip up the river.<lb/>
Although we were eight days making the trip from Barranquilla to this<lb/>
place they tell us that we made a very quick trip for this time of the year.<lb/>
This feature of the time consumed in moving from place to place, while it<lb/>
may (theoretically) impede the progress of the fever, hampers us a great<lb/>
deal in the distribution and shifting of our forces to meet emergencies which<lb/>
may come up. It also makes it very difficult to keep up the supervision of<lb/>
the work by supervising inspectors. Added to this is the surprisingly high<lb/>
cost of everything which I have investigated so far. A campaign here such<lb/>
as I conducted in Peru would cost at least twice what it cost there.</p>
<p>While it is somewhat premature to predict what should be done and<lb/>
to what points the prophylactic work ought to be extended, I am very much<lb/>
inclined to think that Cartagena, the Port of Colombia and Barranquilla<lb/>
should be included and thoroughly cleaned up. I gained this impression as<lb/>
I came up the Magdelena and saw the large number of small villages along the<lb/>
coast, which can easily serve as relaying points for the conduction of the<lb/>
fever down to the coast. I can see nothing to prevent this from happening.<lb/>
The peones travel from point to point, and it will be simply a matter of<lb/>
luck if the fever is not carried down the river in this manner. The land<lb/>
and ship quarantine of which you have been informed is a myth, and for my<lb/>
part I do not place the least bit of reliance in these efforts, or rather<lb/>
I should say supposed efforts.</p>
<p>When we came up we went ashore at Barrnca Bermeja, where we were<lb/>
told by both the Physician of the Tropical Oil and a Colombian Physician from<lb/>
Bucaramanga that there was no yellow fever there, and yet the Garcia family<lb/>
who were fellow passengers were told by relatives of theirs in the native<lb/>
village that there had been quite a few cases of &ldquo;<hi rend="underline">pernicious fevers</hi>&rdquo; with<lb/>
several deaths. On our return we will endeavor to investigate the nature of<lb/>
these fevers.</p>
<p>Yesterday we called at the laboratory of Samper &amp; Martinez and saw<lb/>
some of their cultures of leptospira, and with the exception of the fact that<lb/>
the organisms did not show the pronounced activity of those which Noguchi<lb/>
has, I would be unable to say that they are not <hi rend="underline">Leptospira icteriodes</hi>. Mor-<lb/>
phologically they appeared the same. They had one guinea pig which looked<lb/>
very typical.</p>
<p>I am remaining here until we have a full understanding about the<lb/>
management of the campaign and have secured the necessary resolutions<lb/>
authorizing us to take up the work in any place where it may seem advisable<lb/>
to do so.</p>

<p>Today we attended the services in memory of Mr. Harding, at the<lb/>
American Legation.</p>
