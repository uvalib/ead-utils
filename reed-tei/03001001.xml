<salute>Dear Bro. Bill:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been trying to catch you somewhere between S.F. and<lb/>
N.Y., and enlisted Dr. Ross to help me, but he couldn't wire anything<lb/>
definite, except that you and Marie left Los Angeles Friday night and<lb/>
probably left S.F. the next day.</p>
<p>We have been vastly stirred up and excited:- the Board of<lb/>
Trustees of the Univ. met in Montgomery on Friday, and on Saturday we<lb/>
had a long-distance message from Dr. Johnson, our friend on the Board,<lb/>
saying that he was coming over to see us on a <hi>Very important</hi> matter.<lb/>
At 9:30 P.M. two trustees drove up, in time to save the family from<lb/>
nervous prostration, and said that Dr. Abercrombie had resigned the Pres-<lb/>
idency,-resignation requested,- and that the Board tendered you the<lb/>
Presidency of the Univ. by a unanimous vote, and until your decision<lb/>
was learned, no other name will be even considered. Dr. Johnson was very<lb/>
anxious to meet you in Chicago, so I at once sent a night letter to<lb/>
Dr. Ross, trying to find out the train and route by which you left, but<lb/>
could get no definite data, and had to long-distance Dr. Johnson today to<lb/>
that effect. He will have a letter and telegram to meet you in N.Y.<lb/>
but I promised to write you also on the subject.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson told me privately that they could offer you<lb/>
$7500 or even $8000 a year: a house, lights, fuel, and allowance for<lb/>
entertaining, and other perquisites. The three summer months you would<lb/>
be free to spend where you pleased, of course; your opportunity for<lb/>
building up the university and making a name among educators would be<lb/>
immense, and its by all odds the biggest thing the State can offer,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03001002"/>
-2-<lb/>
not excepting the Governorship. It occurs to me that if you and<lb/>
Goethals are going to fall out, and you are to be thrown back on your<lb/>
army salary, it might be worth your while to consider this. You could<lb/>
get retired,-thirty years service,- and your retired pay, with this<lb/>
salary as President, would be a pretty big thing down here. The<lb/>
trustees say that it would almost certainly be a life position and<lb/>
they are willing to do almost anything you ask to get you here. At<lb/>
first <unclear>blush</unclear> will think as I did, that you can't even consider it,<lb/>
but as I think it over the idea grows more and more attractive. I<lb/>
have no fear of your success in the position; I know that you would<lb/>
make a reputation for yourself in this line, as you have done in<lb/>
in Tuscaloosa; a handsome house with all conveniences and her summers<lb/>
she could almost spend away -- of course we are too interested to be<lb/>
worth much as suggestors; it would be too entirely delightful to have<lb/>
you all near us not to be alluring, but we all feel that you couldn't<lb/>
come without sacrifice of inclination and perhaps some material loss,<lb/>
and we haven't encouraged the trustees to hope that you may accept.</p>
<p>If you decline, let them understand your appreciation: they<lb/>
are trying to confer on you the greatest gift in their power,-one<lb/>
that any man in Alabama would be pleased to have tendered, even if<lb/>
acceptance were out of the question. They may send a delegation on to<lb/>
interview you, so be your most gracious self, that's all we ask.</p>
<p>Were I certain of your movements, as to whether or not you<lb/>
and Marie stop in Washington. I might try to meet you there to talk<lb/>
this over, am strongly tempted to come on to N.Y., but its a long, hot<lb/>
trip for one day of talkey-talk.</p>
