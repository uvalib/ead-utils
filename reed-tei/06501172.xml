General Albert E. Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco 18, California<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am sure that you were as greatly distressed as I to hear of<lb/>
the sudden death of General Kean. I am greatly disturbed. He was such<lb/>
a wonderful man. Colonel Siler wrote me last week that General Kean had<lb/>
entered Walter Reed because of urinary retention and an enlarged prostate and<lb/>
that prostatectomy was being considered. When I heard this on Friday, I<lb/>
dictated a note to Colonel Siler in my anxiety, hoping that by some ethical<lb/>
means one could make the urgent request in favor of a punch operation rather<lb/>
than a prostatectomy. The former is much simpler and safer in any event,<lb/>
certainly in a man of 90. Before mailing the letter I consulted one of our<lb/>
urologists who agreed with me but we decided properly that there was nothing<lb/>
I could do by giving long-distance advice, except perhaps make trouble.<lb/>
Therefore, I refrained from doing anything.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a letter from General Kean's son saying that<lb/>
his father had gone to Walter Reed two weeks ago and that it was evident<lb/>
that prostatectomy would be in order; however because of a sharp drop in<lb/>
blood pressure an abdominal cystoctomy was done under local anesthesia.<lb/>
He did fairly well until August 30 when he had a slight stroke. The next<lb/>
day he could answer questions but there was some paralysis of the left arm.<lb/>
He was resting fairly comfortably. This morning came a wire from Colonel<lb/>
Siler that he died about 6 o'clock last night.</p>
<p>I feel almost as if I had lost a father. I wish indeed I could<lb/>
go to the funeral but I am head over heels in work trying to get ready to<lb/>
go to Europe in three weeks. Furthermore, My associate, Doctor Polley,<lb/>
will be leaving tomorrow for a month in California, speaking in San Francisco<lb/>
by the way, and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>General Kean was a grand man and it has been one of the great<lb/>
privileges of my life to have known him and a few of his comrades, including<lb/>
yourself.</p>

<salute>Always sincerely,</salute>
