Mrs. Robert P. Cooke<lb/>
Whistle Creek<lb/>
Lexington, Virginia<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs. Cooke:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was so sorry to hear the news of Doctor Cooke's passing. Two or three<lb/>
friends sent me clippings from various papers. My brother sent me a nice<lb/>
one from one of the Charlottesville papers. I do hope that he was not ill<lb/>
long. His son-in-law had written me that he was not feeling too well. I<lb/>
wish to express to you and to his family my deepest sympathy.</p>
<p>Doctor Cooke was a distinguished citizen who made a very great contribu-<lb/>
tion to human welfare. It was a rare privilege for me to meet him some<lb/>
years ago in his home, an event I will never forget. It will be my<lb/>
privilege to write the details of his contribution in the book on the con-<lb/>
quest of yellow fever which I shall be writing one of those days.</p>
<p>As I wrote to you all, they are dedicating Camp Lazear in Havana on December 3.<lb/>
The little park and other improvements are being finished. Doctor Cooke's<lb/>
name will appear on one of the bronze tablets and I just received a letter<lb/>
from Doctor Nogueira who is in charge of the affair, asking that I help<lb/>
him obtain a photograph of Doctor Cook. I do not know whether he wants it<lb/>
for publicity connected with the dedication or to frame and hang in the<lb/>
little house. I am writing him today asking him about this and will ask<lb/>
him to write you directly but since time passes, I thought you had better<lb/>
get a photograph ready for him. His address is Dr. Pedro Nogueira,<lb/>
Marti 219, Marianao, Havana, Cuba.</p>
<p>I am hoping to fly to Havana for the dedication and I will try to obtain<lb/>
photographs of the bronze tablets and send you copies.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
