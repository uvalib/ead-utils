Have <unclear>been</unclear> get<lb/>
my report to <unclear>Ramos</unclear><lb/>
<dateline>
Habana L&uacute;nes<date value="1942-01-12">12 de Enero de 1942.</date>
</dateline>
Dr. Phillip S. Hench.<lb/>
Mayo Clinic. Rochester. Minn.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p><unclear>nabout</unclear> two weeks ago I received the tenth of December<lb/>
issue of the Mayo Clinic proceedings. Having found most interesting your<lb/>
article &ldquo;Conquerors of the Yellow Fever&rdquo; I translated it and took it to<lb/>
&ldquo;S<add>a</add>las Radio Station&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Headed by Dr. Donald Nelson, a group of americans doctors were<lb/>
expected in Havana at that time for the formation of the Finlay Institute<lb/>
of the Americas. Thinking this was an apropiate moment Mr. Salas and I<lb/>
decided to inform the President of the Republic of your article and get<lb/>
his help for making Camp Lazear an international monument to the medical<lb/>
classes of Cuba and the United States. On the same day that the President<lb/>
decorated the american doctors, Mr. Salas spoke to him and got his most<lb/>
enthusiastic aproval. The President called Dr. Sergio Gar&cacute;&iacute;a Marruz, (ac-<lb/>
ting Minister of Health and giving him my trnslation of your article<lb/>
begged of him a speedy study and in formation. Dr. G. Marruz found it<lb/>
extremely important and secunded our idea warmly.</p>
<p>Mr. Salas inmediatly informed the public over the air and has considered<lb/>
this scheme his most important transmission.</p>
<p>Last Saturday <add>Salas and I</add> went together to visit Dr. G. Marruz and talked to him<lb/>
for more than two hours of this subject. He is taking to-day Monday, this<lb/>
question to the Council of Ministers, at the Presidents request, to be<lb/>
discussed. They will try to find the way to solve this problem, and will<lb/>
probably have to send a message to the Congress to get his aproval. This<lb/>
is the actual situation.</p>
<p>As Mr. Pogolotti and John J. Moran were mentioned in your article,<lb/>
I look for Mr. Pogolotti in the telephone book as soon as Mr. Salas had<lb/>
spoken to the President and made a date with him at the hospital where<lb/>
I work, to visit Camp Lazear. The next day Mr. Salas and I had the plea-<lb/>
sure of meeting the most kindly Mr. Pogolotti and we all together visited,<lb/>
first the false site and then the real Camp Lazear at the San Jos&eacute; farm.<lb/>
Mr. Pogolotti imformed us of your extraordinary interest and work on this<lb/>
subject. He also gave us Mr. Moran's address and the same afternoon I paid<lb/>
him a visit. There I also heard many things about you.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03906117"/>
<p>According to what I had read in your article, Mrs Morans and Pogolottis<lb/>
information and what I already knew personally, I wrote the notes that<lb/>
Dr. G. Marruz is taking to-day to the Council. I think that the Cuban<lb/>
Government can raise a building having Camp Lazear in its center, more or<lb/>
less following the sketch you gave to Mr. Pogolotti.</p>
<p>It is my idea, and I think also the Presidents to make a<lb/>
ceremony at the dedication of this memorial.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to an interview with the President,<lb/>
and then if this takes place, I will send you more details about the<lb/>
venture.</p>
<p>I want to give you my ideas about this subject. I understand that the<lb/>
would be memorial building, should be a monument to the Cuban and ameri-<lb/>
can medical classes. It is my intention not to accept discussions as to<lb/>
wether the monument should be dedicated to any special person. I have<lb/>
the impression, drawn from your article that you have the same opinion.<lb/>
I sincerely believe that is the only way in which we can carry out our<lb/>
idea with success.</p>
<p>I want you to know that my interest in this subject is graetly<lb/>
intensified by the fact that you are a doctor of the Mayo Clinic that<lb/>
I visited twice, and where Dr. Fred Rankin removed my thyroid gland<lb/>
years ago with the greatest success.</p>
<p>I hope to receive your opinion and any ideas that you have<lb/>
for this memorial project as soon as posible.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours</salute>
<signed>Dr. Felipe Carbonell Ponce</signed>.
San L&aacute;zaro 413<lb/>
Habana Cuba.<lb/>
<seg>
P.S.<lb/>
I am decidedly against transferring Camp Lazear to any other site.<lb/>
