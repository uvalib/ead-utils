<p>We are having quite a drought in this section, as it has<lb/>
not rained since the latter part of August. By this time I suppose Laura<lb/>
has started on her rest and you are collecting data from the library for<lb/>
the other section of &ldquo;THE BOOK&rdquo;. I hope that you are having a nice fall in<lb/>
Washington for as a rule the fall is the pleasentest part of the year in<lb/>
Maryland, the District and Virginia. Its fairly quite here from a pro-<lb/>
fessional point of view but I have had a certain number of consultations<lb/>
since I last wrote you. I trust that my brother Edward has continured<lb/>
to improve under the treatment. In looking over the programme of the<lb/>
Southern Medical Association it appears to me that the Malarial Section is<lb/>
by far the best that they have on their programme as the section on in-<lb/>
ternal medicine is not preticularly interesting. The demonstration of<lb/>
the test fimunity to scarlet fever by the Dicks of Chicago should be of<lb/>
real intrest. From what the papers write they must have a very<lb/>
difficult problem in <unclear>LoS Angeles</unclear> with the Plegue situation, I mean that<lb/>
its in the pneumonic form. But the Service has been expecting it to appear<lb/>
again in California and so it not a surprise. What officer was assigned to<lb/>
this duty?</p>
<p>I put in my application for the Reserve Corps and if commisioned will be<lb/>
a Lt. Colonel.</p>
<p>What is going to make the real difference to the United States is the boys<lb/>
in college and high schools who belong to the R.O.T.C.: for they will be<lb/>
trained from youth and make better officers than the older men dispite our<lb/>
war experance.</p>
<p>I was just wondering how old General Ireland was and if he will be retired<lb/>
before he is reappointed. If so I judge Noble will again come out as a<lb/>
candidate but his chances with a Republican President are not as good as<lb/>
a Demecratic one.</p>

<p>(2)</p>
<p>I certainly am glad that the Service reappointed Dr Cumming and that he<lb/>
has now a sufficient peroid of time, i.e. two tearms, in which to do<lb/>
real constructive work. Do you ever see anything of Mr. and Mrs Tharpe<lb/>
since they have moved to Washington? I hope you secro -iliac condition<lb/>
is giving you less trouble than when you last wrote.</p>
<p>Did Laura get over to Baltimoe and see Tom Brown before she stated to take<lb/>
her rest as she had planned?</p>
<p>I know what a happiness it is for you and Aunt Mary to be toge<del>a</del>ther again<lb/>
for she certainly is one of the most wonderful poeple I have ever had the<lb/>
good <unclear>fortune</unclear> to meet.</p>
<p>This can only be a note but I was thinking of you and wanted to write<lb/>
and ask about you Laura and Aunt Mary.</p>
<p>All you meet here ask to be remembered each time I write.</p>
<p>With love to you and Aunt Mary and Laura</p>

<salute>I am always your devoted son</salute>

P. S. Please remember me to such friends<lb/>
as you may see in Washington and<lb/>
Especially to Mrs Gorgas<lb/>
