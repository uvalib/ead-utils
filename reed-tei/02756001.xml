FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY<lb/>
<dateline>
Dr. Aristides Agramonte,<lb/>
Profesor de Bacteriologia y Patologia Experimental,<lb/>
Facultad de Medicina,<lb/>
Universidad de la Habana, Cuba.<lb/>
-----<lb/>

<salute>My dear Sir;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your kind note of the 13th inst. has reached me<lb/>
after some delay.</p>
<p>It affords me great pleasure to learn that you are about to<lb/>
mention the names of Major Reed's co-workers and give them some<lb/>
credit in the final elucidation of the yellow fever problem, from<lb/>
the sanitarian's standpoint.</p>
<p>To one of us, my <del><unclear>fiiend</unclear></del> friend and classmate Dr. Lazear, (car-<lb/>
ried away by his scientific zeal at an early period of the invest-<lb/>
igation) is due the greatest honor and glory; in fact, he it was<lb/>
who produced the first case, (the soldier Dean,) unknown to the<lb/>
others, and subsequently infected Carroll when the latter did not<lb/>
as yet believe in such mosquito infection. It was after this demons-<lb/>
tration that Lazear allowed himself to be bitten at &ldquo;Las Animas&rdquo;<lb/>
Hospital and not until then was Major Reed communicated with, he<lb/>
being at the time in Washington, as may be verified by the military<lb/>
Order issued for his transfer to Cuba in those days.</p>
<p>At the time the Commission was appointed in 1900, we agreed<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02756002"/>
(2)<lb/>
to work as follows: Maj. Reed was to direct the general work, Car-<lb/>
rol to have charge of the bacteriologic investigation, Lazear the<lb/>
mosquito work, having had training in this field, (the only member<lb/>
of the Board at the time acquainted with the mosquito,) and I had<lb/>
charge of autopsies and pathologic work. Maj. Reed went back to<lb/>
Washington before Lazear produced the first case and returned as I<lb/>
said above at the time of Lazear's death when we prepared our &ldquo;Pre-<lb/>
liminary Note&rdquo; read by Maj. Reed at Indianapolis, at the meeting of<lb/>
the American Public Health Association.</p>
<p>After that, the experimental station, &ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo; was esta-<lb/>
blished and the more thorough work was then carried out by the re-<lb/>
maining members, Drs. Reed, Carroll and myself.</p>
<p>This is a bit of inside history of the Board which I think<lb/>
an honest historian ought to know; it deprives of no credit to any-<lb/>
one and its publication will be the means of  doing fair justice to<lb/>
Dr. Lazear. The real value of his work in the Commission has not<lb/>
been appreciated.</p>
<p>Drs. Stark, Ames, Kean, R.P.Cooke and others were at the time<lb/>
of which I write living at Camp Columbia and took no little interes<add>t</add><lb/>
in our work; they no doubt remember the circumstances surrounding<lb/>
those days. The exact dates when Dean, Carroll and Lazear were in-<lb/>
fected are set down in our papers and the presence or absence of<lb/>
the members of the Board may be shown by the Orders issued at the<lb/>
time.</p>

<p>On a separate page I send you some biographical notes relat-<lb/>
ing to my humble personality. For whatever notice you may give them<lb/>
I thank you most gratefully.</p>
<p>Should you think that I may serve you in any way I shall be<lb/>
very pleased to reciprocate.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very cordially,<lb/>
Yours truly,</salute>
