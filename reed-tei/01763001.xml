<salute>My own precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yesterday's mail brought two mighty<lb/>
sweet letters from little lovie, but somehow or other they were<lb/>
a mighty long time on their journey- One was dated Nov<unclear><hi rend="superscript">r</hi></unclear> 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp;<lb/>
was consequently 22 days in <unclear>Transit</unclear>, and the other dated Nov<unclear><hi rend="superscript">r</hi></unclear><lb/>
20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; was 17 days &ldquo;<unclear>acoming</unclear>&rdquo;- <unclear>Now</unclear>, precious lovie, can you<lb/>
not <unclear>hid</unclear> upon some other days for writing, so that I can<lb/>
hear from my darling in shorter time<unclear>?-</unclear> If you will write<lb/>
on <hi>Thursdays</hi> and <hi>Sundays</hi><unclear>,</unclear> I think it will answer much<lb/>
<unclear>better</unclear> and I will then get my letters in 13 or 14 days, as I did<lb/>
<unclear>right</unclear> along a month <unclear>or</unclear> two ago. I am now sitting at the<lb/>
same table with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <unclear>M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Pherson</unclear> - he on one side and I on the<lb/>
other, and both writing to our <hi>sweethearts</hi> for <unclear>dear</unclear> life! I tell<lb/>
you, lovie, the way the pens are scratching and the ink fly-<lb/>
-ing, is a caution to <unclear>rate</unclear>! We are both, too, using <unclear>this</unclear><lb/>
<hi>small</hi>, <hi>fragile</hi> paper, which was never intended to serve<lb/>
any other purpose than to write &ldquo;compliments&rdquo; to young<lb/>
ladies and ask whether it &ldquo;would be agreeable to escort<lb/>
them to <unclear>church</unclear>, this eve&rdquo;- &ldquo;Hesche&rdquo;! I tell the Doctor, that<lb/>
it was a <unclear>rash</unclear> thing for me to have <unclear>commenced</unclear> <add>on</add> this<lb/>
terrific &ldquo;<unclear>baru-door</unclear>&rdquo; <unclear>paper,</unclear> as I am certain I will have<lb/>
to leave some part of it blank; <unclear>and</unclear> that would be a<lb/>
great disappointment to &ldquo;Mrs. Piggie&rdquo;- (I guess, lovie, dear,<lb/>
if <hi>I</hi> am &ldquo;<unclear>Mr<hi rend="superscript">s</hi></unclear> Piggie&rdquo;, that you must properly be called<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi>Mrs</hi>. Piggie&rdquo;<unclear>?</unclear> No<unclear>?</unclear> &ldquo;I want to know&rdquo;! &ldquo;<unclear>Hesche, enchase</unclear>&rdquo;!) At<lb/>
the <unclear>rate</unclear> at which the doctor's pen is <unclear>whirling</unclear> along<lb/>
the <unclear>lines</unclear>, I think he is certainly going to write <hi>40</hi> <unclear>pages!</unclear><lb/>
that girl of his <unclear>certainly</unclear> &ldquo;lays herself out&rdquo;, as it were,<lb/>
in letter writing- He only writes one letter a week,<lb/>
&amp; that is generally <unclear>short</unclear>, while <hi>she</hi> <unclear>indites</unclear> to him<lb/>
<hi>three long</hi> letters, every week; <unclear>some</unclear> of them containing<lb/>
12 to 20 pages! <unclear>Now</unclear> what do you think of that, lovie?<lb/>
My own private opinion is that such <unclear>condescension</unclear><lb/>
on the <unclear>part</unclear> of one's sweetheart, would <hi>spoil</hi> any<lb/>
man<unclear>,</unclear> and make him think that he is really of more<lb/>
importance than is really the case- Men are vain<lb/>
(and women are, too, Mrs. Piggie,) and they generally puff up<lb/>
their little &ldquo;<unclear>Cancasses</unclear>&rdquo; <unclear>considerably</unclear>, if they <unclear>suppose</unclear> that<lb/>
they are of absolute necessity to any particular <unclear>dam-<lb/>
-sel- show</unclear> that is not the way for a &ldquo;<unclear>fine</unclear> gal&rdquo; to do,<lb/>
if she expects to <unclear>keep</unclear> the &ldquo;upper hand&rdquo;, as it were, of<lb/>
her &ldquo;<unclear>enawored sevain</unclear>&rdquo;, so to speak<unclear>,(</unclear> and I am told, lovie,<lb/>
that woman is very fond of exerting a <hi>little</hi> authority, as<lb/>
it <unclear>were</unclear>, over the &ldquo;<unclear>gent</unclear>&rdquo; who prostrates himself before<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01763002"/>
her shrine of beauty and virtue!) &ldquo;<unclear>How some dives</unclear>&rdquo;, as <add>the</add> Monkey<lb/>
remarked to the parrot, &ldquo;its none of my business,&rdquo; how many<lb/>
times a &ldquo;fellow's&rdquo; &ldquo;gal&rdquo; writes to him: only I am mighty sure<lb/>
that I &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; wrote to a nice &ldquo;fine gal&rdquo;<lb/>
who just made me &ldquo;<unclear>Knuckle down</unclear>&rdquo;, as it were, &amp; write to<lb/>
her, every <hi>day</hi>, and what is very <del>differ</del> true, I loved her<lb/>
all the more for it! But &ldquo;fine gals&rdquo;, lovie, differ from<lb/>
each other as much<del><unclear>es</unclear></del> as peaches on a tree; and of course,<lb/>
a &ldquo;gent&rdquo; must judge for himself what <hi>Kind</hi> of a <hi>peach</hi><lb/>
he is going to pluck! So you are going to get real <hi>mad</hi><lb/>
with &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Piggie&rdquo; for saying that you took the first<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi>chance</hi>&rdquo; that came along? <unclear>how</unclear>, &ldquo;Mrs. Piggie&rdquo;, how <hi>dare</hi> you<lb/>
call me a &ldquo;<hi>chance</hi>&rdquo;? I "aint no <hi>&ldquo;chance&rdquo;</hi>, <hi>now</hi>! Call me<lb/>
&ldquo;Member of Congress&rdquo;, &ldquo;General Grant,&rdquo; &ldquo;Apache Indian,&rdquo; or<lb/>
<unclear>Even</unclear> &ldquo;<hi>Post <unclear>Trader</unclear></hi>&rdquo;, but <hi>don't</hi> call me a &ldquo;<hi>chance</hi>&rdquo;! I can't<lb/>
stand it, lovie! I am, at least, &ldquo;an opportunity,&rdquo; <unclear>or</unclear> an &ldquo;<hi>offer</hi>&rdquo;-<lb/>
or a &ldquo;gent&rdquo;! Well, I never thought that &ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora Piggie&rdquo; was<lb/>
going to &ldquo;dub&rdquo; &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Don Piggie&rdquo;, a &ldquo;<hi>chance&rdquo;</hi>! I think we are<lb/>
about <hi><unclear>even</unclear></hi> lovie, &amp; you just take <hi>this Kiss</hi>, &amp; put it away<lb/>
safely &amp; don't you tell anybody about it! <unclear>said</unclear> you must<lb/>
remember, lovie, that when &ldquo;first we met beneath the ap-<lb/>
-ple blossoms, Kathleen&rdquo;, you had scarcely reached the<lb/>
&ldquo;shank of the evening,&rdquo; of your beauty and <unclear>charms</unclear>, so to<lb/>
speak- You, poor, <unclear>fluttering</unclear> little dove, had just secured<lb/>
your perch upon a spray of lilac, (&ldquo;I want to know&rdquo;!)<lb/>
And was only warbling the first sweet notes of your mor-<lb/>
ning &ldquo;<unclear>ditty</unclear>,&rdquo; when along came a hungry hawk, by<lb/>
name, <unclear>&ldquo;whi OT&rdquo;</unclear>, &amp;c, &amp; <unclear>ruthlessly tore</unclear> you from that<lb/>
&ldquo;sweet-potatoe vine&rdquo;, and bore you away to his &ldquo;<unclear>eyrie</unclear>&rdquo;<lb/>
perch! &ldquo;Eyrie perch&rdquo; is very good, darling little wifie, espec-<lb/>
-ially when applied to a "chiquita <unclear>log-casa</unclear> (observe<lb/>
the <hi><unclear>exquisite</unclear> blending</hi> of the English &amp; Spanish langua-<lb/>
ges, producing <unclear>wondrous</unclear> harmony, lovie,) at Camp Apache.<lb/>
But, lovie says that she is satisfied and so am <hi>I</hi>, and &ldquo;<unclear>thats</unclear><lb/>
what's the matter&rdquo;- Hesche! <unclear>Didn't float</unclear> once more <unclear>adown</unclear><lb/>
the yellow-haired <unclear>Mcherrin's</unclear> winding banks, lovie, dear? and<lb/>
<unclear>dis't</unclear> list to the full-throated notes of the songsters in-<lb/>
-habiting bows over its waters <unclear>pendent</unclear>? I tell you, wifie,<lb/>
that last sentence was a &ldquo;<unclear>squelches</unclear>&rdquo;! I thought at one<lb/>
time that I could never bring it to a <hi>happy conclusion</hi>!<lb/>
Ask son if he can <hi>parse</hi> it, for mama- Does Captain <unclear>Lang-<lb/>
-horne</unclear> still &ldquo;<unclear>ride</unclear> &amp; <unclear>rule</unclear>&rdquo; the <unclear>mcherrin's</unclear> golden <unclear>evavelets?,</unclear><lb/>
Son has absolutely become a very &ldquo;<unclear>distingu&eacute;</unclear>&rdquo; traveller! <unclear>You</unclear><lb/>
will have to get him a copy of the &ldquo;Tourist,&rdquo; if he takes<lb/>
many more journeys- <unclear>And</unclear> eye-glass would also be appropriate.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01763003"/>
Am so glad to know that mother &amp; son arrived safely at Nor-<lb/>
-folk, after a pleasant journey, and that Pa Reed met them<lb/>
at the Depot- From what he writes to me, he is not only proud<lb/>
of his grandson, &ldquo;Sir Lawrence Reeds&rdquo;, but also of his daugh-<lb/>
-ter-in-law, &ldquo;Sir Lawrence's&rdquo; Mother! He always speaks in the<lb/>
most affectionate manner of my pretty wifie, and I know<lb/>
she occupies a place in his affection second to none <unclear>of</unclear> his<lb/>
children. You <unclear>mustn't</unclear> forget to give husband a full <unclear>descrip-<lb/>
-tion</unclear> of your pretty, new dress, for he will <unclear>take</unclear> the greatest<lb/>
interest in knowing how his little darling is <unclear>dressed</unclear> &amp; how<lb/>
pretty she looks. Don't tell me, lovie, dear, that you <unclear>dont want</unclear><lb/>
your picture taken again- Come, that will never do- You<lb/>
forget, precious, that you have never had one taken by a<lb/>
first-class photographer- I want a full <unclear>view</unclear> of your<lb/>
face taken- I mean a full, front face- not a profile-<lb/>
It <hi>must</hi> be done, &amp; husband won't take <hi>&ldquo;no&rdquo;</hi>- &amp; his precious<lb/>
darling must not refuse- Have them taken &amp; send them<lb/>
along- I want them to <unclear>adore</unclear> my <unclear>mantel</unclear> with, &amp; <unclear>I</unclear> must<lb/>
have them! &ldquo;Hesche! <unclear>Euchaw</unclear>&rdquo;! &ldquo;<unclear>Booligs</unclear>&rdquo;! <hi>Tuesday Morning <unclear>9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1877</unclear></hi>.<lb/>
I must get to work and finish my darling's letter, this mor-<lb/>
-ning. It is a dreary, cold morning at Apache- Is raining<lb/>
now and I think will soon change to a real good fall<lb/>
of snow, which will be very appropriate for the Christmas<lb/>
Season. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cruse starts, this morning, for San Carlos, for pur-<lb/>
pose of taking back to the Agency Lt. Gatewood's Scouts, <unclear>whose</unclear><lb/>
term of enlistment <unclear>has</unclear> expired- I know &ldquo;little <unclear>Tomie</unclear>&rdquo; Cruse,<lb/>
as we call him, will have a cold, <unclear>dreary</unclear> ride to-day-<lb/>
I wish you could meet him, darling- He is the most per-<lb/>
fect <hi>boy</hi> you ever saw; and his <hi>laugh</hi>! why it is simply<lb/>
<hi>contagious</hi>! He utters such a hearty roar, when he<lb/>
hears an<del><unclear></unclear></del>ything funny, that every one else is compelled<lb/>
to join in the laugh with him- His little pet dog, &ldquo;Joe&rdquo;,<lb/>
who sleeps with him, every night, has been left in my<lb/>
<unclear>charge,</unclear> during his absence, &amp; is now sitting up in my<lb/>
front window, and whining as if his heart would<lb/>
break. Lt. C. &amp; I are great friends- with all his <unclear>boyish</unclear><lb/>
ways &amp; amusements, he possesses considerable strength<lb/>
of character- He is strickly temperate and does not<lb/>
indulge in gambling, and he declares that he will <unclear>never<lb/>
fall</unclear> into these two vices- Does not use tobacco, either.<lb/>
He &amp; I frequently indulge in a quiet game of <unclear>Euchre</unclear><lb/>
together &amp; enjoy ourselves <unclear>very</unclear> much. I had some desire<lb/>
of going to San Carlos with him, but the cold weather fright-<lb/>
-ened me off. Do you know, lovie, dear, that I haven't sent<lb/>
for a single Christmas present for any of the ladies at the<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01763004"/>
Post? I suppose I should have sent for a pretty book or<lb/>
something of that kind, for Mrs. Harrison &amp; Mrs. Heutig, but I<lb/>
really had forgotten all about it. I don't like to be considered<lb/>
stingy, and they have both been very kind to me- Besides, those<lb/>
little <unclear>tokens</unclear> of esteem from one to another make<del><unclear>s</unclear></del> life some-<lb/>
-thing better &amp; brighter &amp; awake to light the better side of our<lb/>
Nature- Mrs. Harrison will start on the 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> for <unclear>Tucson,</unclear> for<lb/>
the purpose of spending a month or so with Colonel <unclear>Cavr,</unclear> 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
<unclear>Cav.</unclear> &amp; his wife, at Lowell, our old &ldquo;Camping ground&rdquo;- Mrs.<lb/>
<unclear>Carr</unclear> &amp; Mrs. Harrison are old friends &amp; she anticipates a very<lb/>
pleasant time at Lowell, this winter-day very glad she<lb/>
has received the invitation, for I know that a short respite<lb/>
from Apache <unclear>monotony</unclear> will do her much good- Mrs. Heutig<lb/>
will go down later, if her health sufficiently improves- I have<lb/>
<add>had</add> her under treatment for womb trouble for about 6 weeks-<lb/>
She is now much better &amp; her improvement is gratifying.<lb/>
A change of climate, food &amp; faces would do her much good<lb/>
too. Who do you suppose, precious wifie, will act as Mrs.<lb/>
Harrison's Escort to Lowell? Why, the redoubtable Champion<lb/>
of beauty &amp; wit, &ldquo;Adam&rdquo;, the first man! It so happens<lb/>
that he has been ordered down to Lowell on Court Mar-<lb/>
-tial duty- Court meets- Jan. 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; Mrs. <unclear>H</unclear>. seizes this<lb/>
chance of going down- I'll bet my weight in &ldquo;dried <unclear>pea-<lb/>
-nuts&rdquo;</unclear> that &ldquo;Adam&rdquo; &ldquo;pops the question&rdquo; to the widow before<lb/>
he gets to Lowell! But I don't think that he will ever <unclear>suc-<lb/>
-ceed-</unclear> I am so glad that my darling wifie had the chance<lb/>
of seeing <unclear>Miss Neilson</unclear> act as &ldquo;Juliet&rdquo;- I saw her in Brooklyn,<lb/>
in 1874, in the same character, and I thought her acting very<lb/>
fine. How many theatres are there in Norfolk, lovie? Is<lb/>
there only one? I shouldn't think that a City of its size<lb/>
could support more than one theatre- Always go, my darling,<lb/>
when there is acting or singing worth seeing, and enjoy<lb/>
yourself to your precious heart's content. Husband<lb/>
wishes his sweet, loving wifie, a merry, merry Christmas,<lb/>
and his darling little son the same! May you both live<lb/>
to enjoy many happy <unclear>repetitions</unclear> of the coming season,<lb/>
with your ugly old <unclear>Mantee</unclear>! Don't forget, Mama, to get<lb/>
darling little son some nice little present- Make his dear,<lb/>
innocent little heart <unclear>as</unclear> happy as possible- Hang up<lb/>
his sweet little stocking &amp; fill it full of pretties and<lb/>
<hi>Charge it all to papa</hi>! Love his life, how I would like<lb/>
to see it hanging up! Hang up your &ldquo;feet <unclear>little stocking</unclear>&rdquo;,<lb/>
too, my precious wifie- If husband was only there he would fill<lb/>
it <hi>full</hi>! Best love &amp; a Merry Christmas to all- Enjoy yourself, my<lb/>
darling, &amp; don't forget husband- Love &amp; Kisses for Mama &amp; Son-</p>
