<p>YELLOW FEVER MOSQUITOES.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Suppression of the Disease Likely to<lb/>
Follow Present Experiments<lb/>
in Cuba.</p>
<p>Special Correspondence NEW YORK TIMES.</p>
<p>HAVANA, Jan. 9.--In these days of new,<lb/>
interesting, and at times startling discov-<lb/>
eries it is not surprising that but small at-<lb/>
tention has been paid by the public at large<lb/>
to the revival of the investigations and ex-<lb/>
periments first begun in 1881 by Dr. Charles<lb/>
Finlay of Havana regarding the transmis-<lb/>
sion of yellow fever by mosquitoes. Verily,<lb/>
has this creature been anathematized times<lb/>
without number both for his song and bite,<lb/>
and were he not a callous creature he would<lb/>
retire to the stagnant pool where he was<lb/>
born and whence he came; but, unblushing-<lb/>
ly, viciously, and almost with malice afore-<lb/>
thought, he seeks whom he may to infect<lb/>
with the germs of yellow fever, malaria,<lb/>
and perhaps other diseases.</p>
<p>The Surgeon General of the Army, possi-<lb/>
bly actuated by the brilliant investigation<lb/>
of Italian experts on the Campagna with<lb/>
the malarial parasite, appointed a board<lb/>
last July, consisting of men well known<lb/>
in the world of scientific medicine, heading<lb/>
the list with Major Walter Reed, Surgeon,<lb/>
United States Army, who for years con-<lb/>
ducted experiments in the laboratory of the<lb/>
Army Medical Museum in Washington, fol-<lb/>
lowing with Drs. Carroll, Agramonte, and<lb/>
Lazear, Acting Assistant Surgeons, United<lb/>
States Army, to conduct an extended se-<lb/>
ries of experiments covering various meth-<lb/>
ods for the transmission of this disease.<lb/>
It is whispered that this board has discov-<lb/>
ered the much-disputed germ of yellow<lb/>
fever, and, if so, it is not unlikely that at<lb/>
the next session of the Pan-American Medi-<lb/>
cal Congress they will so announce.</p>
<p>It is possibly too early to affirm that the<lb/>
results of the board's study and investiga-<lb/>
tion are proof positive, but, at any rate, an-<lb/>
other mile post has been passed upon the<lb/>
high road so carefully followed by the med-<lb/>
ical profession the world over, though not<lb/>
until now has so much attention been paid<lb/>
to the spread of yellow fever, which is<lb/>
ever erratic.</p>
<p>The mosquito selected for the experi-<lb/>
ments, and the one with which results have<lb/>
been obtained, is the Culex fasciatus. This<lb/>
insect is striped upon the body and legs,<lb/>
and differs from the black mosquito in that<lb/>
it seems to prefer the dark and dislikes the<lb/>
wind, and is a comparatively quiet creat-<lb/>
ure, while the black variety is restless,<lb/>
never remaining long in one place.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that after the<lb/>
mosquito bites a yellow fever patient the<lb/>
poison it extracts must remain in its stom-<lb/>
ach from eight to twelve days to permit the<lb/>
micro-organism to incubate. At the end of<lb/>
this time, should the insect sting a suscep-<lb/>
tible non-immune individual, the probabil-<lb/>
ity would be a case of well-marked yellow<lb/>
fever. Inasmuch as it takes about ten days<lb/>
for the germ to incubate in the stomach,<lb/>
and bearing in mind the habits of the Culex<lb/>
fasciatus, (striped variety,) it is readily un-<lb/>
derstood why persons contract the fever<lb/>
where they sleep, which is characteristic.</p>
<p>Observation of the thousands of non-im-<lb/>
mune Americans who have resided here<lb/>
since Jan. 1, 1899, leads to the conclusion<lb/>
that yellow fever is not contagious in the<lb/>
sense of other diseases, such as smallpox,<lb/>
&amp;c., if it can be classed among the infec-<lb/>
tious or contagious diseases at all. At Las<lb/>
Animas Hospital, where many patients with<lb/>
the fever have entered and left, either to<lb/>
resume their vocations in life or else sor-<lb/>
row<unclear>fully</unclear> borne to their last resting place in<lb/>
the beautiful Cristobal Colon Cemetery, the<lb/>
nurses have nearly all been non-immunes,<lb/>
and yet not a case has arisen within the<lb/>
confines of the grounds. In fact, the hos-<lb/>
pital is claimed by the nurses to be a<lb/>
health resort, and only to-day the writer<lb/>
heard two of them lament because they<lb/>
must return to the States, there being prac-<lb/>
tically no fever at this time.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that, though<lb/>
bitten by an infected mosquito, it is by<lb/>
no means certain a case of fever would fol-<lb/>
low, for the particular individual bitten<lb/>
might be able to resist the further multipli-<lb/>
cation of the germ; this is the case in ty-<lb/>
phoid fever, where many having drunk of<lb/>
infected water or milk, only a few may<lb/>
contract the disease. Yet it has been held<lb/>
that if foreigners from northern countries<lb/>
staid long enough in Havana they would<lb/>
surely contract yellow fever.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that the studies now<lb/>
in progress will develop methods for the<lb/>
partial or complete suppression of yellow<lb/>
fever, and this, it is believed, can be done<lb/>
by the growing of fish and tadpoles in<lb/>
swamps, planting eucalyptus around ponds<lb/>
and marshes and along the streams, cov-<lb/>
ering pools with kerosene to prevent the<lb/>
larvae coming to the surface and develop-<lb/>
ing, putting aniline dyes of certain kinds<lb/>
in the water, these dyes not being poison-<lb/>
ous to cattle or man, carefully isolating<lb/>
each new case by putting mosquito bars<lb/>
at the windows and doors so that the in-<lb/>
sect cannot get at the patient, and destroy-<lb/>
ing those already in the room.</p>
