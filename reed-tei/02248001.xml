<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I got two long<lb/>
and very sweet letters from<lb/>
my darling Miss Invalid, yes-<lb/>
terday, and read them as I<lb/>
rode out to the experimental<lb/>
station, and how I laughed over<lb/>
them! Not exactly over the<lb/>
one of the twelvth of Decr, for <hi>that</hi><lb/>
letter was a sort of <hi>dole-<lb/>
ful</hi> contribution to epistolary<lb/>
composition, but over the<lb/>
second one, of the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, which<lb/>
was written after my pre-<lb/>
cious Miss Gouty had read<lb/>
of our success with &ldquo;los<lb/>
mosquitos&rdquo; and which was<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02248002"/>
a very, very sweet letter<lb/>
indeed- If my sweet wifie<lb/>
and my precious daughter are<lb/>
<hi>proud</hi> of me, then I don't<lb/>
care much for what the<lb/>
rest of the world thinks.<lb/>
You would have been de-<lb/>
lighted, indeed, had you been<lb/>
here, this afternoon, when<lb/>
we had <hi>sixteen</hi> of Havana's<lb/>
chief physicians out to<lb/>
see and examine our yel-<lb/>
low fever cases- It was<lb/>
to me extremely interesting<lb/>
to see how cautious they<lb/>
were, at first, for some<lb/>
of them came, evidently<lb/>
already much prejudiced;<lb/>
but as the examination<lb/>
went on, they were com-<lb/>
pelled to admit and did<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02248003"/>
after awhile admit that<lb/>
the cases were none other<lb/>
than <hi>genuine yellow fever.</hi><lb/>
Just <hi>one</hi> out of the <hi>sixteen</hi><lb/>
thought that perhaps our<lb/>
mildest case was doubtful,<lb/>
but the other fifteen acknowl-<lb/>
edged that the <hi>four</hi> cases were<lb/>
cases of yellow fever- Our<lb/>
last case, which was taken<lb/>
sick Decr 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, was just en-<lb/>
tering his <hi>fourth</hi> day, and<lb/>
was so plain that it could<lb/>
not be disputed- It was<lb/>
indeed a great victory for<lb/>
us- As they left the ward<lb/>
&amp; indeed while there, you<lb/>
never heard such talking<lb/>
nor saw such gesticulating<lb/>
in your life! La lingua es-<lb/>
pa&ntilde;ola had free rent for<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02248004"/>
once! Our last case is<lb/>
quite sick, but I think that<lb/>
he will pull through alright-<lb/>
Now to change the subject-<lb/>
say, sweetheart, aren't you<lb/>
and precious joy putting on<lb/>
a good deal of style going<lb/>
to so many teas? Well,<lb/>
well, well; don't you think<lb/>
that you should save a few<lb/>
<del>f</del>till I get back? Do you<lb/>
dare tell your Mr Mantee<lb/>
that he <hi>never has time</hi> to<lb/>
<hi>go</hi> to <hi>afternoon teas</hi>! You<lb/>
just wait until I am<lb/>
S. G, &amp; you will see about<lb/>
that! So you have a new<lb/>
dress and bonnet? Well, I<lb/>
know that you look just too<lb/>
pretty for anything! I'd give<lb/>
a dollar to see my joys<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02248005"/>
all dressed up and ready<lb/>
for an afternoon tea! What<lb/>
absurdity, lovie, dear, about<lb/>
Miss M.'s parlor! Everybody<lb/>
knows that you are <hi>boarding</hi><lb/>
and nobody would pay the<lb/>
slightest attention to the<lb/>
room or furniture. Call<lb/>
on Mrs. General Merritt- If<lb/>
you see the General, give<lb/>
him my love- So you really<lb/>
saw Willie Sinclair? Where<lb/>
was &ldquo;Daisy&rdquo;? She <hi>must</hi> have<lb/>
been there! <hi>Without</hi> Daisy<lb/>
no military &ldquo;Tea&rdquo; would be<lb/>
complete. I <hi>am</hi> so glad<lb/>
that you went to all of them<lb/>
and had a good time- Goodness<lb/>
gracious! <hi>no</hi>; the S. G. <hi>has<lb/>
not mentioned even</hi> any mili-<lb/>
tary garrison! Jerusalem!<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02248006"/>
You didn't really believe that<lb/>
I was in earnest? What<lb/>
an idea! I had, yesterday,<lb/>
a cable from the Surgeon Gen-<lb/>
eral to this effect: &ldquo;I con-<lb/>
gratulate you&rdquo;. This was<lb/>
in answer to mine of the day<lb/>
before telling him of our suc-<lb/>
cess- Of course, I expect a<lb/>
letter from him within a<lb/>
few days, but it won't<lb/>
make me <hi>one hundredth</hi> as<lb/>
happy as my darling wifie's<lb/>
wherein she said that she<lb/>
was &ldquo;<hi>proud</hi>&rdquo; of me! It was<lb/>
like a darling sensible<lb/>
woman to say that I must<lb/>
not hurry back now on<lb/>
your account, but that when<lb/>
I did come, &ldquo;we would have<lb/>
a good time&rdquo;! Indeed, we<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02248007"/>
will! I don't have to &ldquo;get<lb/>
fat &amp; strong&rdquo;, for I am already<lb/>
as stout as a lager-beer<lb/>
drinker and with the appetite<lb/>
of a &ldquo;digger&rdquo; Indian! Now that<lb/>
the <add>mental</add> strain of the past few<lb/>
weeks is over, I feel splen-<lb/>
didly and &ldquo;sleep like a top&rdquo;!<lb/>
I am now taking it very<lb/>
slowly and enjoying every<lb/>
day- The recovery of my<lb/>
purposely-made-sick pa-<lb/>
tients has naturally <add>made me</add> feel<lb/>
happy and more thankful<lb/>
than I can express- But<lb/>
it is bed-time, and I must say<lb/>
good-night and the sweetest<lb/>
dreams to my darling girls!<lb/>
<hi>wednesday morning -- 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi> -- I declare,<lb/>
my sweet children, that your<lb/>
old Mr. Teesigon came very<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02248008"/>
near oversleeping himself!<lb/>
wouldn't that have been<lb/>
too distressing, since this<lb/>
letter would then have been<lb/>
delayed till <hi>Saturday</hi>! Just<lb/>
to think that Christmas is<lb/>
almost here! How the time fairly<lb/>
flies! December will be gone<lb/>
before we know it- Precious<lb/>
Farmer lady please see that<lb/>
our dear little daughter gets on<lb/>
the right train in going to Anap-<lb/>
olis &amp; tell her to be very careful<lb/>
at Overton on her return. Papa<lb/>
hopes that her visit will be<lb/>
a delightful one- From the bot-<lb/>
tom of his heart, Papa wishes<lb/>
her dear mother &amp; her darling<lb/>
self a <del>happy</del> <add>Merry</add>, Merry Christ-<lb/>
mas and a happy, happy New Year.<lb/>
Boo! Boo! you precious joys!<lb/>
kisses &amp; love &amp; love &amp; kisses for my<lb/>
sweet, sweetest girls!</p>
