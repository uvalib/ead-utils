<pb n="1" id="f03328003"/>
<p>Before the yellow fever epidemic of 1878 in the City of<lb/>
Memphis, Tennessee the City had already suffered seriously<lb/>
from war, reconstruction, cholera, small-pox, and two previous<lb/>
epidemics of yellow fever (in 1867 and in 1873) and in the<lb/>
latter year over 2000 of the inhavitants had died. By the middle<lb/>
of August, 1878, it had become generally known that the dread<lb/>
disease had again reached the city. &ldquo;Business stopped,&rdquo; says<lb/>
the official report of the epidemic, "stores and offices were<lb/>
hastily closed. Men, women, and children poured out of the<lb/>
city by every avenue of escape. . . To the cities of the far<lb/>
north and the far west they fled, too many of them to die on<lb/>
the way like dogs, neglected and shunned as if cursed by God.</p>
<p>"By the last week of August it was estimated that there<lb/>
were about 3000 cases of the fever. . . An appalling gloom hung<lb/>
over the doomed city. At night it was silent as the grave, by<lb/>
day it seemed desolate as the desert. There were hours, es-<lb/>
pecially at night, when the solemn oppressions of universal<lb/>
death bore upon the human mind as if the day of judgment were<lb/>
about to dawn. . . Death prevailed everywhere. Trade and traffic<lb/>
were suspended. The energies of all who remained were enlisted<lb/>
in the struggle with death. The poor were reduced to beggary,<lb/>
and even the rich gladly accepted alms. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 14th of September, the day of the heaviest<lb/>
mortality, many buoyant natures succumbed. They looked about<lb/>
them for convalescents, but they were not to be found; a few of<lb/>
them were reported, but they seemed nearly all of them to have<lb/>
been permanently disabled. The cry for food, for clothing, for<lb/>
money, for doctors, for as many as a thousand coffins, went out<lb/>
by telegraph to the ends of the earth, and a prompt and generous<lb/>
response came back. . . . The medical estimate puts the total<lb/>
population, during the epidemic, at 19,000, and the total sick<lb/>
at 17,600, the deaths being 5,150, a little less than one-third.&rdquo;<lb/>
