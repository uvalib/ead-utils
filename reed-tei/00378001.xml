<p>OBITUARY: JESSE WILLIAM LAZEAR.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN:</p>
<p>Before we proceed with the programme this evening, I<lb/>
should like to say a few words about our dear friend Lazear,<lb/>
whose sad death at Quemados, Cuba, on September 25, is so<lb/>
fresh in our minds. Lazear was born just outside of Balti-<lb/>
more thirty-four years ago. He graduated at the Academic<lb/>
Department of the Johns Hopkins University in 1889, and<lb/>
three years later obtained the degree of M. D. from Columbia<lb/>
University, New York. After this he was an interne in the<lb/>
Bellevue Hospital for two years. After spending the greater<lb/>
part of the year in studying abroad, particularly in Paris, he<lb/>
returned in 1895 and became one of the medical staff of the<lb/>
Johns Hopkins Hospital. In the summer of 1896, Dr.<lb/>
Lazear was married and began the practice of medicine in<lb/>
Baltimore. At the same time, however, he was an assistant<lb/>
in clinical <unclear>microscopy</unclear> in the University, and in the laryngo-<lb/>
logical department in the Hospital dispensary. Last winter he<lb/>
obtained an appointment as assistant surgeon in the army<lb/>
with special laboratory duties, and was stationed in Havana.<lb/>
There he soon became interested in the study of yellow fever,<lb/>
and for several months he had been one of the commission<lb/>
appointed by the Surgeon-General, for the study of this dis-<lb/>

ease. He had been constantly exposed to infection, and<lb/>
finally, in the course of his duty, contracted his fatal illness.</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear was a man of few words but keen perception.<lb/>
He was an extremely careful and thorough worker. He kept<lb/>
his own counsel, asked few questions and little help of his<lb/>
associates, but he was a man who, when he started an under-<lb/>
taking, had the ability and enthusiasm to keep quietly at<lb/>
work until he accomplished his end. It was through his ex-<lb/>
cellent work that we were able several years ago to make our<lb/>
first positive intra vitam diagnosis of <unclear>septic&aelig;mia</unclear> due to the<lb/>
diplococcus of Neisser. His valuable studies upon the in-<lb/>
ternal structure of the malarial parasite, which I had the<lb/>
pleasure of bringing before this society last winter, are re-<lb/>
membered by all.</p>
<p>Personally, he was an exceptionally simple, high-minded<lb/>
and lovable man. He could not have failed to find in a short<lb/>
time a public position in which his unusual merits would have<lb/>
become more generally known.</p>
<p>I should like to suggest to the Society the adoption of the<lb/>
following resolutions:</p>
<p>"Whereas, On the 26th day of September, our beloved<lb/>
colleague and friend, Jesse William Lazear, lost his life in the<lb/>
discharge of his duty as a member of the United States<lb/>
Yellow Fever Commission;</p>
<p>"And whereas, His exceptional ability in his profession, his<lb/>

simplicity and modesty as a man, had greatly endeared him to<lb/>
all whose good fortune it was to know him;</p>
<p>"Be it resolved, That we, his former colleagues and asso-<lb/>
ciates, do hereby express our profound sorrow at the loss, to<lb/>
the community of one whose future was unusually rich in<lb/>
promise, to ourselves, of a dear friend and fellow student;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be it further resolved, That we express to his wife and<lb/>
family our warmest and most heartfelt sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The resolutions were unanimously adopted.</p>
