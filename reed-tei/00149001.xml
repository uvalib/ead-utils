<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>After mailing a letter to<lb/>
you yesterday afternoon, I went down<lb/>
to St. Bartholomew's Hospital and learned<lb/>
there that operations were held every<lb/>
day and that I would be admitted to<lb/>
the amphitheatre. They all admit foreign<lb/>
medical students, and seem glad to have<lb/>
them attend. I will now be able to<lb/>
see operations every day of my stay here.<lb/>
After leaving the hospital I took dinner<lb/>
at a restaurant on the Strand. Afterward<lb/>
I took a walk and near Charing Cross<lb/>
I met Doctor Wilson and had a little<lb/>
talk with him. He has been travelling<lb/>
around on the continent and will<lb/>
sail for home on August 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. I went<lb/>
to the &ldquo;Savoy&rdquo; and saw the &ldquo;Gondoliers&rdquo;.<lb/>
It was played better than in New York but<lb/>
the company might be improved, Geraldine<lb/>
Ulmar is not in it now. The theatre is<lb/>
small and is not to be compared with<lb/>
our Casino. The theatres here are arranged<lb/>
differently from in America. The orchestra<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00149002"/>
is divided into two and the back part of<lb/>
it is called the pit. The highest prices are<lb/>
charged for the front of the orchestra, then<lb/>
comes the dress circle and then the pit.<lb/>
I always go to the pit, you can see very<lb/>
well from there, much better than from<lb/>
the dress circle it seems to me. The only<lb/>
disadvantage is that they do not reserve<lb/>
the seats there and it is necessary to<lb/>
go early. They usually charge half-a-crown<lb/>
or sixty cents, <del>A</del> in some places only a<lb/>
shilling. This morning I took a good<lb/>
sleep which I was in need of and<lb/>
got up too late for church. I am going<lb/>
some place to-night, probably Westminster.<lb/>
I took a walk this morning down about<lb/>
St. James Park and saw \ Buckingham Palace<lb/>
St. James Palace and Marlborough House, the<lb/>
residence of the Prince of Wales, and then<lb/>
along Pall Mall to Charing Cross where I<lb/>
took lunch at one of Gatte's restaurants.<lb/>
While I was there I saw Prof Martin<lb/>
come in and I went up and spoke<lb/>
to him. He is an Englishman, you remember.</p>
<p>Wed. July 30</p>
<p>On Sunday night I did not go to church<lb/>
as I had intended but went to a band<lb/>
concert in Hyde Park. The Sunday concert<lb/>
is a new thing in London and I wanted<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00149003"/>
to see how it was taking with the people.<lb/>
There was a great crowd there and many<lb/>
of them seemed to appreciate the music.<lb/>
However the appreciative class seemed to<lb/>
be composed mostly of German and French,<lb/>
the Britons as a rule came for a frolic.<lb/>
On Monday I went to the Tower and<lb/>
inspected it thoroughly, I suppose it is<lb/>
the most historically interesting place<lb/>
in the world. I got a few leaves<lb/>
there which I send in this. The large<lb/>
ivy leaf is from the Bloody Tower.<lb/>
The small ivy leaf grew on a mound near<lb/>
the Beauchamp Tower where all<lb/>
those interesting carvings are found on<lb/>
the wall. The yellow leaf grew on<lb/>
a tree on Tower Green and it was<lb/>
lying on the <del>Va</del> scaffold where Anne<lb/>
Boleyn, etc were beheaded. Monday<lb/>
night, I went to the Shaftsbury Theatre<lb/>
and saw Willard play in &ldquo;Judah&rdquo;.<lb/>
Yesterday I was at Guy's Hospital all<lb/>
afternoon watching operations. In the<lb/>
evening I went to the Criterian and<lb/>
saw Charles Wyndows.</p>
<p>Norris came down from the Highlands<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00149004"/>
and took a room here yesterday.<lb/>
I am going with him to the National<lb/>
Gallery this morning. He will<lb/>
return to America on the same<lb/>
vessel with me.</p>
<p>I received your letter of the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> yesterday<lb/>
and enjoyed it very much. I will<lb/>
attend to those Neuralgia Crystals. I hope<lb/>
you found the weather more pleasant<lb/>
in Brownsville than in Pittsburgh.<lb/>
I received also a batch of papers, which<lb/>
I have commenced to read.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
