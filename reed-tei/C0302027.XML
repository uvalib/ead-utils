HRM<lb/>
TO THE SECRETARY GENERAL IN CHARGE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF<lb/>
PUBLIC HEALTH, MEXICO, D.F.<lb/>
</opener>
<p>I have the honor to inform you on the suspected case of yellow<lb/>
fever which I reported in my telegram on the 21st of this month:</p>
<p>Proceeding from Manzanillo where he had left on the 13th,<lb/>
Luis B. Corona arrived in this city suffering from no disease; but later<lb/>
he felt pains in the abdomen and legs, and soon thereafter fever develop-<lb/>
ed. The fever rose on each third day. On the sixth day he was given a<lb/>
saline purgative which caused abundant yellowish fetid and mucous evacua-<lb/>
tions, containing small traces of blood. This alarmed his family and it<lb/>
was decided to call for a doctor - Dr. Jo&sacute;e Ma. Herrera.</p>
<p>Dr. Herrera confirmed the above mentioned characteristics of the<lb/>
evacuations; pulse 130, temperature 38 C., abdomen soft to palpation and<lb/>
tympanic to percussion; hypertrophy of the liver and spleen, perfect men-<lb/>
tality; damp tongue having a dirty and uniform color; gums showed no<lb/>
changes. The patient did not complain of any disturbances other than those<lb/>
caused by the frequent evacuations. Arsenas quinine was prescribed.</p>
<p>After the administration of this drug, the evacuations became<lb/>
markedly hemorrhagic. On the 20th, Dr. Ciro Hurtado was summoned to see<lb/>
the patient. Dr. Hurtado found the patient with very weak pulse and in<lb/>
a very unrestful state, moving from side to side, with high temperature,<lb/>
and almost in a state of agony. He died three hours after Dr. Hurtado<lb/>
had seen him. The latter was informed that after Corona's death, the<lb/>
cadaver bled from the nose, and the body was markedly yellowish in color.<lb/>
The death certificate was issued as suspected yellow fever.</p>
<p>The undersigned was informed of this matter by Mr. Richardson.<lb/>
We immediately went to the patient's home; we took note of pertinent data.<lb/>
We were told that the cadaver had been taken to the cemetery. We went<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0302028"/>
- 2 -<lb/>
there arriving just as he was being buried.</p>
<p>I do not think that the appearance of the cadaver was that of<lb/>
yellow fever; Mr. Richardson agreed with me on this point. The hands<lb/>
had the usual yellowish color seen in cadavers; the face was swollen;<lb/>
there was ecchymosis of the eyelids, and abundant nasal hemorrhages. The<lb/>
autopsy showed profuse intestinal hemorrhages, fetid gases, pale liver,<lb/>
the cross section of which was hard and icteric. A fragment was collected<lb/>
which Mr. Richardson sent to your Department for study.</p>
<p>The undersigned will appreciate it very much and begs that the<lb/>
result of the examination of the specimen be communicated to him for his<lb/>
own knowledge and perfection in the fulfillment of his duty as a Sanitary<lb/>
Delegate.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>

Sanitary Delegate.<lb/>
