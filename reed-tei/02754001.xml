</dateline>
<salute>Dear D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Latimer;</salute>
</opener>
<p>In response to the request<lb/>
conveyed in your letter of February 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I<lb/>
take pleasure in communicating the following<lb/>
which is approximately accurate.</p>
<p>In obedience to the War Department order<lb/>
convening the board D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed and I sailed<lb/>
from New York June 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1900 and reached<lb/>
Havana June 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. The board was organized<lb/>
and work begun immediately. On August<lb/>
4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed returned to the United States, remained<lb/>
there about two months and then returned<lb/>
after the death of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lazear to collect data<lb/>
for the preliminary report. This required<lb/>
about a week or ten days after which he<lb/>
again returned to the United States to com-<lb/>
plete the report and present it at the<lb/>
meeting of the Am. Public Health Association<lb/>
as Indianapolis toward the end of October<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02754002"/>
2.<lb/>
About November 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> he sailed again for<lb/>
Havana, to take up the second series of<lb/>
experiments intended to be confirmatory of<lb/>
the first. His final departure from Havana<lb/>
was about February 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1901.</p>
<p>After his return to the United States<lb/>
his time was taken up with various<lb/>
matters of routine, among them correspondence<lb/>
with Major Gorgas who was then engaged<lb/>
in clearing Havana of yellow fever and under<lb/>
whom D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Guiteras was working to confirm<lb/>
the results of the Commission and establish, if<lb/>
possible the theory of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Finley that immunity<lb/>
against yellow fever could be conferred through<lb/>
the bites of recently contaminated mosquitoes<lb/>
and the subject escape any attack of the<lb/>
disease now and in the future; and further<lb/>
that the bite of a single insect would convey<lb/>
a mild attack while multiple bites would<lb/>
be followed by a severe attack. The opposite<lb/>
was shown to be the case.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f02754003"/>
<p>3.</p>
<p>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed was Professor of Bacteriology and<lb/>
clinical Microscopy at the Army Medical School<lb/>
and Professor of Bacteriology and Pathology at<lb/>
the Columbian University, Washington, D.C. He<lb/>
firmly believed that smallpox is conveyed by<lb/>
a biting insect and we made some attempts<lb/>
to <unclear>variolate</unclear> calves by causing them to be<lb/>
bitten by bed bugs that had previously been<lb/>
applied to patients suffering with small pox.</p>
<p>In regard to myself there is nothing<lb/>
of interest to be related, I have been a<lb/>
wandering good-for-nothing who fell in<lb/>
love at 14 and left home at 15, roughed it<lb/>
in the Canadian backswoods for several<lb/>
years and finally drifted into the Army.<lb/>
I have served twenty-four years as a<lb/>
soldier, four and a half years as a Contract<lb/>
Surgeon and two and a half in the Medical<lb/>
Corps as First Lieutenant and Assistant<lb/>
Surgeon, While still a soldier I studied<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02754004"/>
4.<lb/>
medicine at the University of the City of<lb/>
New York and the University of Maryland,<lb/>
graduating at the latter school, and took<lb/>
post graduate courses in Bacteriology and<lb/>
Pathology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital<lb/>
in the early nineties, before the establishment<lb/>
of the medical school.</p>
<p>The fact of which I am especially<lb/>
proud is that I was the first to succumb<lb/>
to experimental mosquito inoculation.<lb/>
D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lazear applied a single contaminated<lb/>
insect to my arm on August 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1900 and<lb/>
I was taken sick August 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> with an attack<lb/>
free from black vomit but so severe that on<lb/>
three successive days it was reported I would<lb/>
not recover. With a wife and five <hi>young</hi><lb/>
children at home my thoughts may be better<lb/>
imagined than described. This recollection<lb/>
brings back the look of terror in poor<lb/>
Lazear's eyes when he realized that black<lb/>
vomit was impending.</p>
<pb n="5" id="f02754005"/>
<p>5.</p>
<p>On the day that I was taken sick Lazear<lb/>
applied the same mosquito to a soldier who<lb/>
came down with a mild attack of yellow<lb/>
fever five days later.</p>
<p>A letter addressed to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Aristides<lb/>
Agramonte at the University of Havana or<lb/>
in care of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Finlay will surely<lb/>
reach him.</p>
<p>At the Surgeon General's Office I learn<lb/>
that the address of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. P. Cooke is,<lb/>
Boyce, Virginia.</p>
<p>The addresses of Kissinger and<lb/>
Moran I am unable to obtain there.</p>
<p>The two soldiers who slept in the in-<lb/>
fected clothing house with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cooke were<lb/>
Privates Folk and Jernegan. These three<lb/>
were followed by Privates Hanberry and<lb/>
Weatherwalks and these in turn by Privates<lb/>
Hildebrands and England. Folk, Jernegan<lb/>
and Hanberry afterward submitted to<lb/>
experimental inoculation and suffered<lb/>
(over)<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02754006"/>
6.<lb/>
attacks of yellow fever in consequence.</p>
<p>I am truly delighted though not<lb/>
surprised at the progress D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kelly is<lb/>
making and wish him the fullest<lb/>
measure of success. It will always afford<lb/>
me pleasure to give any aid within<lb/>
my power.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute>
<signed>James Carroll</signed>.
