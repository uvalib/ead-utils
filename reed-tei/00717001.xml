<salute>My Dear Mother:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is Easter Sunday just at night-<lb/>
My barges came back last night &amp; are now lying<lb/>
outside of the bar &amp; I will bring them in tomorrow.<lb/>
A great thing is water transportation- Three men (that would<lb/>
do) will bring a little over a mile the two flats<lb/>
with <hi>10</hi> cords of wood &amp; 10,000 f't of lumber it<lb/>
will be less than 4 hours work; about <hi>12</hi>.4 horse waggonloads<lb/>
&amp; if we have worst wind they will come of themselves.<lb/>
Glad am I to get them back, we have been idling<lb/>
here for three weeks waiting for them, with an abun-<lb/>
dance of work to do. The weather has cut me out of 8 days.<lb/>
Little Ed isn't well the past three days - a bad kind of<lb/>
diarrhea - although not a violent one. The others are<lb/>
all well- Laura is pretty well over her grippe,<lb/>
&amp; although not fully strong is getting so.<lb/>
We had a rough trip back from Biloxi went over<lb/>
before diseases - &amp; for the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> time this winter had to<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00717002"/>
stop for harbor, but stopped only one hour.<lb/>
I don't get sea sick but the travelling<lb/>
doesn't suit me. I am always tired &amp;<lb/>
confused the next day &amp; yet while afloat<lb/>
I am all right no matter how rough provided<lb/>
we are under way.</p>
<p>I do not expect to go ashore more than once more before the<lb/>
season opens - although I will probably spend two days at ship<lb/>
Island on the next trip of the sloop</p>
<p>Taken all things together I believe I will be glad when Q. begins<lb/>
I expect less work, but considerably more bother, especially about<lb/>
the beginning, than usual. I am expecting to hear from<lb/>
the steamer proposed to be furnished, but as things are here I had<lb/>
just as soon for her to stay away as to come. I will <unclear>if she comes</unclear><lb/>
have to discharge some of my old - &amp; good - employees, which<lb/>
is always a painful thing to do.</p>
<p>I will be able to pay the $400.00 by June 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> (or as soon thereafter<lb/>
as the May cheques came in) &amp; will be very glad to get it done.<lb/>
The big freezes of March 2 &amp; 16 seem to have been severe in<lb/>
Fla. What they did to me I have not heard, but seem to have<lb/>
been very hard on the vegetables - especially tomatoes &amp; early<lb/>
sweet potatoes &amp; water melons. Everything was full of young<lb/>
growth. It was colder in Jacksonsville than in <hi>Norfolk</hi><lb/>
&amp; reached <hi>24&deg;</hi> all around <hi> N.O. </hi> &amp; <hi>Mobile</hi>. Mr. Hendrix is<lb/>
a man to whom correspondence comes hard &amp; while I don't suppose<lb/>
any damage is done we cannot draw as favorable an <unclear>Angu-<lb/>
ry</unclear> from his not writing as if he were a readers writer<lb/>
the only risk is to the young trees &amp; to the blows for this years<lb/>
crop &amp; I rather expect that the young trees were not set<lb/>
out waiting for a rain - it has been <hi>a very</hi> dry year &amp;<lb/>
so that little or no harm is done. The grown orange tree is tough, when<lb/>
anywhere near dormant, but the young one is for more tender, &amp; a new<lb/>
planted are should<lb/>
be <hi>very</hi> easily nipped.<lb/>
However I will hear if any harm is done next week. The old trees I know<lb/>
are all right - although<lb/>
a short crop<lb/>
is probably<lb/>
for one<lb/>
year.</p>
<p>Rec' a letter from Mr. MD saying that Emma would start about April 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> &amp; asking<lb/>
when I could return the $400. <hi>Maybe</hi> I can by the early part of May, but by June I<lb/>
am certain.</p>
