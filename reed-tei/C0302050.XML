<salute>My dear Col. Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>So far we are &ldquo;making haste slowly&rdquo; but I am hoping that we<lb/>
shall be able to get our affairs arranged so that we can leave here on<lb/>
Saturday afternoon. We want to spend a day in Girardot as we go down<lb/>
for the purpose of finding out what their <hi rend="underline">Stegomyia</hi> index is and if<lb/>
there are any suspicious cases of sickness. From there we go to Barranca<lb/>
Bermeja where we will spend about two days, this for the purpose of find-<lb/>
ing out what is possible about the &ldquo;pernicious fevers&rdquo; reported, following<lb/>
which we will go to Bucaramanga.</p>
<p>As things appear now I doubt that the Bucaramanga region is of<lb/>
the greatest importance for the present. If the rumors which I have heard<lb/>
have any foundation, i.e. such as the report of cases dying with black vomit<lb/>
in Puerto Santos which is on the Le Brija River and in fairly easy and<lb/>
direct communication with Banco (population 5167) and other points on the<lb/>
Magdelena river, the problem then will be to save the large coast towns;<lb/>
Cartagena, Barranquilla and others. Calamar which is six hours from Bar-<lb/>
ranquilla by steamer going down the river, is a town of 6000 and over ac-<lb/>
cording to statistical reports. Up the river we have Honda with over 8000<lb/>
and Girardot with more than 10,000, some say 18,000.</p>
<p>If we find the fever in such outside points as Puerto<lb/>
Santos, Puerto Wilches and the Village of Barranca it is quite certain that<lb/>
the infection is actually being relayed towards the coast in many ways; such<lb/>

as travel from village to village in the canoes, small launches and passen-<lb/>
gers on the large steamers who go only from port to port, besides the peones<lb/>
who travel afoot and the different pack trains. It is useless to talk<lb/>
about a quarantine in a country of this kind, as it would be quite mislead-<lb/>
ing to depend upon it to control the spread of the fever. The serious side<lb/>
of this is that it appears that we shall be obliged to very considerably<lb/>
extend the sphere of our operations, and to make quite a decided change in<lb/>
what might be called the strategy of the campaign. To me it seems that if<lb/>
we wish to avoid the disaster of having the fever reach the coast a campaign<lb/>
should be commenced with as little delay as possible in the coast towns.<lb/>
Such a program will be expensive, principally due to the very high cost of<lb/>
all articles of equipment and the comparatively high wages which one has to<lb/>
pay the employees. It seems that the lowest paid inspector gets $60.00<lb/>
pesos per month. The native supervisors in Bucaramanga are getting from<lb/>
$80.00 to $100.00 per month. This about twice what I paid in Peru. Trans-<lb/>
portation is equally expensive and as slow as it is expensive. The problem<lb/>
is much more complex than I gathered from my conversations with Dr. White,<lb/>
and from the few experiences which I have had so far there is not such<lb/>
thing as being comfortable anywhere except here in Bogota, and as soon as<lb/>
we get our resolutions passed we will have very little occasion for being<lb/>
here, except once in a long while to attend some business matter.</p>
<p>The places which have had these rumored cases are all outside<lb/>
of the zone of activities of the Bucaramanga campaign, but are either on<lb/>
or sufficiently close to the river towns to start a series of relays. For<lb/>
the present Cucuta is a little importance as a factor of the spread of the<lb/>
fever in Colombia is concerned, and if it has been recently infected the<lb/>
mischief has already been done on the Venezuelan side. This I will investi-<lb/>
gate as soon as I have the Magdelena valley region organized.</p>

<p>Rents are high, and a house which could serve both as the main<lb/>
office and living quarters for the men who are away from home would cost<lb/>
from $150.00 to $200.00 per month.</p>
<p>The question of a secretary, which is indispensable, who knows<lb/>
something about both languages and short hand will cost from $200.00 to<lb/>
$250.00 per month and travel expense when away from home. These prices<lb/>
have rather stunned me, but it is no use to attempt work of this kind<lb/>
unless one does it right. If one is to succeed one must have the necessary<lb/>
help of the right kind, and poorly paid help very rarely is worth having.</p>
<p>When I consider the hardships of travel, and there will be a<lb/>
lot of it, $400.00 and all expenses is the minimum which can be offered<lb/>
to any worth while Inspector who we might need to bring in to help out in<lb/>
the organization of the work. Any good man who is brought in for less is<lb/>
going to feel that he has been imposed upon and will be a dissatisfied<lb/>
worker.</p>
<p>I shall be unable to report anything more definite until after<lb/>
the investigation in Bucaramanga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the probability of bringing my family down to this coun-<lb/>
try, I must say that it seems quite out of the question. The trip up the<lb/>
river would be far too hard for Mrs. Hanson and the little children. The<lb/>
food is such that the children would certainly get sick, and there is not<lb/>
a comfortable cabin on any of the boats. The only thing which I have considered<lb/>
would be the probability of getting a house for them if possible at some high<lb/>
cool point on Ancon Hill. Col Fisher and the Governor agreed to help me in<lb/>
this matter in case I decided to do so. I would be able to see them occasion-<lb/>
ally there as one could go from Puerto Colombia to Cristobal in two days.<lb/>
The idea of being here for two years with the family in the states is far<lb/>
from ideal. I have not heard a word from them since leaving Sioux City,<lb/>
Iowa.&rdquo;</p>
