<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your letter<lb/>
of July 21, this morning. I am<lb/>
very distressed to hear that you have<lb/>
been so sick. I hope you were<lb/>
really as much better as you say<lb/>
you were. This certainly must be<lb/>
a terrible summer in America. I saw<lb/>
by to-days London paper, that the thermometer in New York was 99&deg; and<lb/>
that there were many cases of prostration.<lb/>
I hope you are now in Brownsville.<lb/>
Even if you are back in Pittsburgh<lb/>
you will have a more comfortable room<lb/>
at uncle Tom's. I know I have been<lb/>
writing very ridiculous letters lately<lb/>
but I have to write them hurriedly<lb/>
and I am nearly always tired.<lb/>
This sight seeing business is very<lb/>
good as an education but there is<lb/>
very little pleasure in it. You cannot<lb/>
help rushing. To see everything here right<lb/>
would take a year.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00150002"/>
<p>On Wednesday morning I went to the<lb/>
National Gallery but I did not have<lb/>
time to go all over it, so I will have<lb/>
to go again <del>to-day</del> to-morrow  at half-<lb/>
past one I went over to St. Thomas'<lb/>
Hospital and watched operations<lb/>
- there all afternoon. In the evening<lb/>
I took a walk in the fashionable residence<lb/>
part of town near Hyde Park. On Thursday<lb/>
morning I went to the bank after letters<lb/>
but found that they were not distributed<lb/>
yet, so I had to go again this morning<lb/>
and even then I could not get the<lb/>
papers. There is a great deal of delay<lb/>
about this system of getting letters<lb/>
through bankers. After going to the<lb/>
bank yesterday I went to Sir John <unclear>Soame's</unclear><lb/>
Museum in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Here<lb/>
I saw two of Hogarth's series, the<lb/>
&ldquo;Election&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Rake's Progress&rdquo;.<lb/>
I had already seen the &ldquo;Marriage a la Mode at the National Gallery.<lb/>
In the afternoon Norris and I went<lb/>
through the Museum of the Royal College<lb/>
of Surgeons staying there four hours.<lb/>
It is the first medical museum in<lb/>
the world. In it is the skeleton of<lb/>
O'Brian the famous Irish giant of the last<lb/>
century. He was eight feet tall. There<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00150003"/>
are a great many dissections of normal<lb/>
bodies, besides pathological specimens<lb/>
abnormalities, monstrosities etc.<lb/>
In the evening we went to the French<lb/>
Exhibition where they have a Wild<lb/>
East show representing an Arab<lb/>
camp with fancy riding, fights, etc.<lb/>
There was a Frenchman there who<lb/>
-had four trained lions. It is hard<lb/>
to imagine trained lions but it is<lb/>
an actual fact that this man made<lb/>
these lions do a member of tricks<lb/>
such as see-sawing, making pyramids<lb/>
and driving in a chariot. The grounds<lb/>
at the Exhibition were beautifully<lb/>
decorated and lighted.</p>
<p>This morning I went up a monument to<lb/>
look at the city from above but it<lb/>
was not very satisfactory an account<lb/>
of the smoke. This afternoon I went<lb/>
to the Zoological Gardens. They have<lb/>
a magnificent collection of animals<lb/>
there. Norris and Knapp are at the<lb/>
Crystal Palace this evening, but as<lb/>
I was tired I concluded to take<lb/>
a night off. My time in London is<lb/>
drawing to a close and I have many<lb/>
things to see yet but I cannot do<lb/>
everything. I will go over to Paris<lb/>
on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<p>A letter was forwarded from Edinburgh<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00150004"/>
containing Prof. McColloms card and<lb/>
a letter from Uncle Tom. Prof. McColloms<lb/>
must have thought it strange that<lb/>
I did not call and I cannot write<lb/>
and explain to him as I do not know<lb/>
his regular address. I wish you<lb/>
would tell Uncle Tom about it and<lb/>
ask if he knows Prof. McCollom's<lb/>
address.</p>
<p>Saturday</p>
<p>I spent all this morning at the National<lb/>
-Gallery, and I enjoyed it thoroughly<lb/>
although it is very tiresome to go over<lb/>
a large gallery. Immediately after lunch<lb/>
I went to the old Guildhall. They have<lb/>
there a museum containing various<lb/>
articles dug up in London some of<lb/>
them Roman, also some old signs and<lb/>
just now a collection of paintings.<lb/>
Afterwards I went to the Royal Academy<lb/>
of Arts where the annual exhibition<lb/>
is being held. There were a great<lb/>
many fine paintings there including<lb/>
three of Alma Tadema, however I did<lb/>
not like these as well as the ones<lb/>
Mr. Walters has. They are all new of<lb/>
course, two of them are portraits.<lb/>
Altogether I have seen a vast<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00150005"/>
number of pictures to-day, there were<lb/>
2119 at the Academy and about as<lb/>
many at the <del>Nl</del> National Gallery. I<lb/>
would like to take more time and<lb/>
look carefully at a great many<lb/>
of them. I did go over the National<lb/>
Gallery carefully and I had been<lb/>
there before.</p>
<p>I hope you are taking good care<lb/>
of yourself and that the weather is<lb/>
not affecting <del>l</del> you unless it happens<lb/>
to be good weather.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>

<salute>Your affectionate son</salute>
