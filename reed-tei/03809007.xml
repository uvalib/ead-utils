<salute>My dear Mr. Bullard:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I do appreciate your autographing your pictures and returning<lb/>
them to me. Will you please remind me again in what year each of these<lb/>
pictures was taken? I believe you told me that the photograph of you<lb/>
all dressed up so nattily was in the year 1901. I don't quite remember<lb/>
when the rowing photograph was taken.</p>
<p>Enclosed you will find a talk I gave during the week of the<lb/>
American Medical Association meetings in Cleveland. The painting was<lb/>
not quite finished but it is really very nice and was unveiled by Walter<lb/>
Reed's daughter. Kissinger was there and most regretably had a very<lb/>
severe stroke thirty-six hours later, just after he returned home. He<lb/>
is unconscious much of the time, paralyzed on the right side and for<lb/>
a while was not expected to live but now seems to be at least holding<lb/>
his own. I don't know whether that is a blessing or not.</p>
<p>The audience at the time of the unveiling was small but very<lb/>
select and included the Mayor of Cleveland, the President and President-<lb/>
elect of the American Medical Association, deans of some medical schools,<lb/>
representatives from certain art institutions, as well as Miss Reed, the<lb/>
artist, Mr. Kissinger and myself. I have been so Peripatetic that I<lb/>
still haven't written out adequately my notes on your own story. I will<lb/>
try to do this as soon as I possibly can in the next few weeks, and get<lb/>
it to you for your corrections and amendation.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
