<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your reprint &ldquo;Yellow Fever in Peru&rdquo; several days ago<lb/>
but did not acknowledge the receipt of it as I wanted to have time<lb/>
first to read it over carefully from beginning to end, and this I have<lb/>
only been able to do recently.</p>
<p>The article is of especial interest to me after my experience on<lb/>
the West coast and especially in Peru, and I am sure it is a real con-<lb/>
tribution to our knowledge of yellow fever and brings out so well that<lb/>
stegomyia control is the fundamental thing, a fact which I find many<lb/>
people with yellow fever experience do not know or are not willing to<lb/>
concede.</p>
<p>I especially enjoyed your classification of society in Payta<lb/>
based on the number of water containers each possessed.</p>
<p>I have heard from Hansen several times, once a few weeks ago. He<lb/>
says he is willing to leave Latin America forever, but I doubt if he<lb/>
will be satisfied away from such a troubled existence after the experiences<lb/>
he has been through.</p>
<p>I hope sometime soon to be able to talk over with you a plan that I<lb/>
have regarding the Quarantine work of this station. As a plan it is yet<lb/>
rather hazy, but the principles are clear and are those that I advocated<lb/>
and finally started at Panama, and in which you always supported me. The<lb/>
basis is that the European Ports should act under the general direction<lb/>
of this Station and that our measures should be light or severe depending<lb/>
upon the manner in which precautions at European ports were taken. At the<lb/>
same time this station could be the center where the best methods to be<lb/>
taken at European Ports could be determined in order that the best methods<lb/>
could be actually determined and their use be standardized.</p>
<p>At present the measures put into effect at European ports and upon the<lb/>
voyage, while very much improved, are not standard, and are open to con-<lb/>
siderable improvement. I find it difficult to keep informed as to conditions<lb/>
and what is actually being done.</p>
