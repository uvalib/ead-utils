<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of October 28 and am sorry that illness<lb/>
prevented me from sending you a reply sooner.</p>
<p>I concur in the conclusions of your letter and your action<lb/>
concerning the program outlined by Pedro. The most astounding<lb/>
thing to me was that they left out Lazear's important work at<lb/>
Camp Columbia. Dean and Carroll, and also Dr. Pinto, certainly<lb/>
belong on Pedro's list. Lazear's work at that time furnished<lb/>
the real reason for <add>the</add> establishment of Camp Lazear for, in no<lb/>
other way, could it be definitely proven whether the mosquito<lb/>
was the carrier or not. Those experiments were just as important<lb/>
as the later controlling experiments which were done at Camp<lb/>
Lazear.</p>
<p>Pedro's remarks made about &ldquo;the inoculations by Carroll and Reed<lb/>
at Columbia Barracks with fresh, warm serum&rdquo; were those done by<lb/>
Carroll alone in Havana after Camp Lazear was closed. They had<lb/>
no connection with <del>that</del><add><unclear>thelatter</unclear></add> Camp and could well be left out of Pedro's<lb/>
program.</p>
<p>Pedro's list of persons to appear on the plaque I approve as you<lb/>
have done. However, in order to make it clear, I think the list<lb/>
of the men who took the fomite test (Cooke, England, Hildebrand)<lb/>
and the men who took blood inoculations (Andrus, Forbes, and Olsen)<lb/>
must be included.</p>
<p>I also feel that it is quite fitting to put Lambert's name on the<lb/>
plaque as he did splendid work for Ames. The only thing about him<lb/>
which I have criticized was his pernicious efforts to be placed<lb/>
on the Roll of Honor to which the law did not entitle him. These<lb/>
were my conclusions in my book, Pages 191-192.</p>
<p>I feel differently about Miss Warner for I am not competent to<lb/>
state whether she is entitled to this honor or not. While writing<lb/>
my book, my attention was called to her remarks in Kelly's book<lb/>
on Yellow Fever. She stated, I think, that Walter Reed left the<lb/>
Officer's Mess because of indecent remarks made by the younger<lb/>
officers. You will find this explained on Page 198 of my book.<lb/>
I think from information I obtained while investigating this<lb/>
matter, that she was one of the nurses who cared for Lazear<lb/>
during his illness. If so, I would favor placing her name on<lb/>
Pedro's list. But I could not prove it. Kean felt as I do<lb/>
about her remarks and I probably have his<lb/>
statement in his file of letters</p>

<p>Dr. Philip S. Hench</p>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>November 5, 1952</p>
<p>In regard to what you wrote me about John Peter Barstad, I have<lb/>
no recollection about him at all. He may have been a member of<lb/>
the Hospital Corps Detachment at Columbia Barracks, but he<lb/>
certainly was not one of the volunteers. You know as well as<lb/>
I do that the Board's final reports were complete in every<lb/>
detail about the men who volunteered to take the tests. A<lb/>
few years ago, someone sent me (and I remember you knew about<lb/>
the case at the same time) information about Dr. Paul Mazzuri<lb/>
who also claimed to have volunteered. He, likewise, could not<lb/>
have done that without its being published in the Board's report.<lb/>
I am enclosing the little card about Mazzuri for you to put in<lb/>
your files. He belongs to your &ldquo;pretender&rdquo; list.</p>
<p>You might write to the Editor of the Minneapolis Tribune that if<lb/>
they have any reliable information about Barstad's service in<lb/>
Cuba you would like to have it so that the matter could be investi-<lb/>
gated and tell them about what I said. I do not wish to rob a<lb/>
dead veteran of any honors due him but there is something wrong<lb/>
somewhere.</p>
<p>I feel highly honored to be included among those &ldquo;who cooperated<lb/>
too&rdquo;. Whether or not I am entitled to such distinction, I don't<lb/>
feel that I should comment. I think, however, that to that list<lb/>
should be added Stark's name because he was of great help to<lb/>
Reed in many ways and was just as enthusiastic, if not more so,<lb/>
than anybody else at Camp Columbia.</p>
<p>I hope the &ldquo;caseta&rdquo; is still standing and as the season for hurricanes<lb/>
is now about over for Cuba, it is probably safe for another year.<lb/>
I am afraid Pedro is not going to be able to finish the plaque<lb/>
properly with all of this haste and I should like to see the<lb/>
ceremonies postponed for a few months.</p>
<p>After seven months in the Letterman Hospital following that fall of<lb/>
mine in February, as I wrote you, I am back home and doing well<lb/>
but still badly crippled. In other respects I am quite well. Give<lb/>
my regards to Dr. Pedro Nogueira when you write him. He has been<lb/>
most faithful in his efforts to help you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
