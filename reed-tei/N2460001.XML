<p>What Surgeon General Sternberg Says.</p>
<p>Surgeon General Sternberg, U. S. A., is<lb/>
perhaps the highest living authority on<lb/>
yellow fever. For more than a quarter of<lb/>
a century he has made it a study, and to<lb/>
that task he has brought not only special<lb/>
equipment as a microscopist and bacteri-<lb/>
ologist, but the keen, original intelligence<lb/>
so indispensable to any useful exploitation<lb/>
of that equipment. Dr. Sternberg has not<lb/>
investigated yellow fever as a mere ab-<lb/>
straction. He has united theory with<lb/>
practice, and has cemented the union<lb/>
with long, careful, and enlightened inves-<lb/>
tigation. What he says upon this most<lb/>
important subject is therefore of the<lb/>
profoundest interest. It represents both<lb/>
authority and information, knowledge and<lb/>
brains.</p>
<p>The Surgeon General's address to the<lb/>
Social Science Association, Wednesday<lb/>
evening, was devoted to yellow fever. It<lb/>
was delivered without reference to notes<lb/>
or memoranda-unnecessary aids in his<lb/>
case--and was on that account all the<lb/>
more attractive and impressive. His hear-<lb/>
ers felt, of course, that he spoke of what<lb/>
he surely knew and understood, and had<lb/>
no missgivings as to his passing the bound-<lb/>
ary of ascertained and demonstrated<lb/>
fact. <hi>Thus, when he declared that the<lb/>
source, the germ, of the malady is un-<lb/>
known he disposed at once of the clamor</hi><lb/>
of a tiresome and noisy swarm of quacks<lb/>
who have for years past laid claim to<lb/>
this or that discovery and impudently be-<lb/>
sieged the public mind with their ridicu-<lb/>
lous and unwarranted pretensions. Dr.<lb/>
Sternberg has examined almost every one<lb/>
of these imagined scientific triumphs and<lb/>
found them without merit. Long ago he<lb/>
ranged himself with the leading yellow<lb/>
fever experts of the South, who, after a<lb/>
lifetime of patient and enlightened search,<lb/>
had rejected not only the germ, but the<lb/>
fifth theory and honestly confessed that,<lb/>
so far, they had sought in vain. He took<lb/>
no one's word, of course; he sought for<lb/>
himself, but the result was a repudiation<lb/>
of all the pretended discoveries. Again,<lb/>
Dr. Sternberg spoke for the most experi-<lb/>
enced yellow fever specialists in discard-<lb/>
ing the contagion hypothesis. No really<lb/>
intelligent observer--qualified by practice<lb/>
and opportunity--believes that yellow<lb/>
fever can be transmitted from one person<lb/>
to another by mere contact. The statis-<lb/>
tics of the great Gulf city institutions,<lb/>
such as the Hotel Dieu and the Charity<lb/>
Hospital of New Orleans, forbid the<lb/>
thought. The records of the parish prison,<lb/>
in the same city, show that no one ever<lb/>
contracted the disease because of proxim-<lb/>
ity, no matter how close, with a patient.<lb/>
The history of the Howard Association--a<lb/>
charitable society, founded fifty years ago,<lb/>
and having ramifications in every Gulf<lb/>
town formerly visited each year by yellow<lb/>
fever--this history shows that non-im-<lb/>
munes have nursed the fever's victims<lb/>
year after year, occupying the same room,<lb/>
often sleeping on their beds, without con-<lb/>
tracting the disease in consequence. Dr.<lb/>
Sternberg has compiled and analyzed these<lb/>
statistics, subjected them to the inquisi-<lb/>
tion of his perfected knowledge, and now<lb/>
confers upon them the sanction of his<lb/>
great authority.</p>
<p>Thus far The Post can fairly claim an<lb/>
independent and original concurrence with<lb/>
Surgeon General Sternberg. We have for<lb/>
years insisted upon both these points, and<lb/>
with no backing other than our own ex-<lb/>
perience, observation, and study of scien-<lb/>
tific declaration in the premises. <hi>To Dr.<lb/>
Sternberg's further pronouncement touch-<lb/>
ing the theory of transmission through<lb/>
the agency of the mosquito we naturally<lb/>
give our prompt adherence</hi>. We do not<lb/>
understand Dr. Sternberg as saying that<lb/>
the mosquito is the only medium of com-<lb/>
munication. Our reading of his statement<lb/>
is that he regards it as unquestionable,<lb/>
and <hi>from such a source this opinion is en-<lb/>
titled to acceptance on all hands</hi>. Touch-<lb/>
ing the future exploitation of this hypoth-<lb/>
esis, we claim no gift of prophecy. With-<lb/>
out question it should be exploited to the<lb/>
utmost. Meanwhile, Dr. Sternberg has<lb/>
rendered inestimable service to the cause<lb/>
of common sense and civilization. If we<lb/>
can only destroy the stupid and cruel su-<lb/>
perstitions upon which Southern quaran-<lb/>
tines have been conducted so long and so<lb/>
disastrously, we shall have taken a long<lb/>
step in the direction of the light.</p>
