<salute>My dear Col. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your last letter of Oct. 14 was rec'd<lb/>
on the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and gave me the good<lb/>
news that you would be relieved from<lb/>
duty at Hot Springs about Nov 10<lb/>
and go on a round of inspections<lb/>
of what they were doing at certain<lb/>
other General Hospitals. Then you<lb/>
would return to Hot Springs, pack up,<lb/>
and drive home where you would see<lb/>
the family &amp; leave the car, coming<lb/>
here in Dec to make your report &amp;<lb/>
return home for Christmas, I hope<lb/>
you arranged your program so you would<lb/>
be home for thanksgiving and that you<lb/>
are there now to see what the Army boy<lb/>

could do to the drumstick of a turkey<lb/>
yesterday- I wrote to you on 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Nov. that<lb/>
the Governors of the Club had ruled<lb/>
that rooms at the Club could not be<lb/>
let to non-members on Cards, in<lb/>
view of the demand for them by the<lb/>
members coming home from service<lb/>
abroad- But our upstairs <unclear>locataires</unclear><lb/>
have now departed and we can<lb/>
put you up here with us- Our<lb/>
house keeping is however of a light<lb/>
order with a part-time cook and<lb/>
dinner at 1 oclock with only soup<lb/>
and wine in the evening, so a good<lb/>
trencher man like you would probably<lb/>
prefer to get a real dinner down town.<lb/>
You will have a fine quiet upstairs<lb/>
to do your work however and we<lb/>
will love to have you under our roof<lb/>
I would love to have you rummage thru<lb/>

my disorderly files of papers and<lb/>
take any of them which you<lb/>
would want- We had last Mon-<lb/>
day the annual meeting of the Walter<lb/>
Reed Memorial Assn. I am not sure<lb/>
that I have ever told you of that<lb/>
very select self-perpetuating body.<lb/>
It was a group of Walter Reeds admir-<lb/>
ers who after his death raised a<lb/>
fund of $25,000 for a monument to<lb/>
him. But the interest was to be given<lb/>
to Mrs Reed during her life time<lb/>
and to Blossom Reed there after for<lb/>
her life- Of course Mrs Reed has her<lb/>
pension of $125.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> a month and a<lb/>
quite handsome additional sum given<lb/>
by an unknown donor so she has been<lb/>
well taken care of- Mr. Bell President<lb/>
in 1903 of the American Security &amp; Trust Co<lb/>
took a great interest in this fund and for<lb/>
his life time was the Treasurer- I am the<lb/>

Ac<lb/>
K<lb/>
4<lb/>
only <add>living</add> one of the original group of Incorpo<lb/>
rators, or Managers as they are now<lb/>
called, of the fund which is now about<lb/>
$35,000 and am the President. Gen.<lb/>
Ireland is V. P. and Col Siler is the<lb/>
Secy- The Treasurer is always an<lb/>
officer of the Amer. Security &amp; Trust Co.<lb/>
His name is Ireland but no relation<lb/>
to our friend- There were 21 Incorpo-<lb/>
rators but all the vacancies have not<lb/>
been filled- A vacancy occurred two<lb/>
days before our last meeting and<lb/>
you were elected to fill it- There are<lb/>
no dues or duties, except for the<lb/>
officers, and attendance at the annual<lb/>
meeting if in Washington- The date is on<lb/>
the date of death of Walter Reed-<lb/>
We regard it as quite an honor, and<lb/>
there is no doubt that you have earned<lb/>
it among the Managers present who<lb/>

voted unanimously for your election-<lb/>
I am sending you herewith the only<lb/>
printed matter which there has ever<lb/>
been in connection with this Corporate<lb/>
body- It was put together by me to<lb/>
be sent with a letter signed by<lb/>
Gen. George M. Sternberg, asking for<lb/>
contributions, to a small group<lb/>
who contributed the fund-</p>
<p>You can see the sort of men that ad-<lb/>
mired Reed from the list of Incor-<lb/>
porators- And I am sure that you<lb/>
will value this ancient document</p>
