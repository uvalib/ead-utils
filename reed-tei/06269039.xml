Dr. William Duffield Robinson,<lb/>
2012 Mount Vernon Street,<lb/>
Philadelphia.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Robinson:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just received your paper read before the Sydenham Coterie<lb/>
of Philadelphia on the subject &ldquo;Prolongation of Life&rdquo;. I thank you for it<lb/>
very much and note that you were most generous in giving credit to General<lb/>
Ireland and myself for helping you obtain some data with regard to disabil-<lb/>
ities that were found to exist during the examination of the draft during<lb/>
the war. In reading the paper over, however, I notice one statement which<lb/>
begins at the foot of page 5 and is carried over to page 6, which I think<lb/>
inadvertently you have not made quite correctly. You say --</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too great honor cannot be given to General Gorgas for his<lb/>
effort resulting in the discovery of the means by which the<lb/>
yellow fever germ is propagated and distributed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What really happened was this: Some time during the eighties Dr. Carlos<lb/>
Finlay of Havana, Cuba, advanced the theory that in his opinion yellow fever<lb/>
was probably a mosquito borne disease. However it was only an opinion and<lb/>
<hi>he never did anything</hi> either to prove or disprove it. The U. S. Yellow Fever<lb/>
incorrect<lb/>
Commission, of which Walter Reed was the Chairman, conducted experiments in<lb/>
<del><unclear>1899 and</unclear></del> 1900 <add>and 1901</add> which absolutely proved that yellow fever was transmitted by a<lb/>
mosquito (Stegomyia fasciata) and in no other way. Of course those experiments<lb/>
are known to you and all other well informed medical men and were classical.<lb/>
Based on the discovery of Walter Reed and his co-workers that the mosquito was<lb/>
the only transmitting agent, Gorgas, at that time Chief Health Officer of the<lb/>
Port of Havana, Cuba, inaugurated sanitary measures which lead to the eradica-<lb/>
tion of yellow fever from Havana at that time. There was a brief outbreak again<lb/>
about 1906, which was quickly wiped out under the administration of Colonel Kean,<lb/>
then Sanitary advisor to the Provisional <unclear>Government</unclear> of Cuba. General Gorgas con-<lb/>
tinued his excellent practical sanitary measures in the Panama Canal Zone and<lb/>
of course it was that work which made it possible to build the Canal, although<lb/>
the actual construction was carried out by engineers.</p>
<p>I am sure you will not think me presuming to bring to your attention the<lb/>
incorrectness of the statement you made in your article, but having full knowl-<lb/>
edge of the facts I feel certain you would wish me to do so. The fact that<lb/>
Reed and his co-workers made the actual discovery of the cause and method of<lb/>
transmission of yellow fever does not in any way detract from the monumental<lb/>
work of General Gorgas. There is truly glory enough for all. I think your<lb/>
article is most interesting and quite timely.</p>
<p>With <unclear>kindest</unclear> regards,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Fraternally yours,</salute>

Surgeon General</signed>
