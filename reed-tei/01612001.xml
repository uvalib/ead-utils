<salute>Miss Emilie,</salute>
</opener>
<p>It may appear a little late in the<lb/>
day, but I will venture to wish you &ldquo;a happy,<lb/>
thrice happy New year&rdquo;! may it bring you<lb/>
much happiness and many friends!<lb/>
The old year passed away so calmly and<lb/>
quickly and the New Year followed in its<lb/>
footsteps so softly, that I was not<lb/>
aware of the change for several hours<lb/>
thereafter. In fact, balmly sleep had made<lb/>
me totally oblivious to all changes.<lb/>
I can remember the time when I would<lb/>
have been ashamed to make such<lb/>
an acknowledgement; for it was<lb/>
my custom to sit and watch the<lb/>
hands of the old clock as they slowly,<lb/>
but surely, neared the hour of midnight,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01612002"/>
and when that important moment, at<lb/>
last, arrived, I would jump to my feet<lb/>
and give three hearty cheers for the<lb/>
New Year; or, if influenced by a more<lb/>
sober mood, would remain on &ldquo;ben-<lb/>
ded knee&rdquo;, silently praying that my<lb/>
record for the New Year might be<lb/>
better and more acceptable than it<lb/>
had been during the old.<del>year</del>. But, of<lb/>
late, I have lost much interest in bid-<lb/>
ding farewell to the &ldquo;old&rdquo; or in welcom-<lb/>
ing the &ldquo;New.&rdquo; The night of the 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of December, as far as I am concerned,<lb/>
has no more importance attached<lb/>
to it than any other night in the year.<lb/>
I have been absent from home and<lb/>
friends, so many years, that I even<lb/>
forget to celebrate Christmas, a day<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01612003"/>
which in times gone by was to me the<lb/>
pleasantest of all. Very many times<lb/>
circumstances have been such as to<lb/>
prevent me from entering into the joys<lb/>
of the occassion, as happened during<lb/>
the Christmas just passed- I had to<lb/>
work and leave to others less arduous<lb/>
duties. Yet this is not such as I would<lb/>
have it be. It is far, very far from<lb/>
expressing my desires. I think there<lb/>
is no more fitting occassion than<lb/>
Christmas week for the reunion of<lb/>
the scattered members of a family,<lb/>
and for the renewal of those pledges<lb/>
of friendship and love which are <add>so</add><lb/>
sweet to every heart. In this &ldquo;vale of<lb/>
tears&rdquo; where there <add>are so</add> many burdens to bear,<lb/>
so many annoying trivialties to harrass,<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01612004"/>
it is but following our natural impulses<lb/>
to long for some hour or day when we<lb/>
can cast aside all cares and exchange<lb/>
our frowns for smiles, our sighs for<lb/>
songs. I have much cause to fear that<lb/>
such an occassion will never again<lb/>
present itself in my father's family-<lb/>
Like unto the chaff before the winds, we<lb/>
are scattered even unto &ldquo;the four cor-<lb/>
ners of the earth&rdquo;! Still mingled with<lb/>
these feelings of regret, I yet possess<lb/>
some consolation, some comfort- I<lb/>
have a vivid consciousness of a<lb/>
love for my <del>p</del>brothers and sisters as<lb/>
pure as the love of angels, over which<lb/>
nor time nor distance has any power;<lb/>
of a veneration for my parents as<lb/>
noble as the noblest; of a memory<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01612005"/>
of my sainted mother as pure as the crys-<lb/>
tals in Heaven's great dome; yes, thank<lb/>
God, so holy and bright is this memory<lb/>
that neither storm, nor fire, nor flood,<lb/>
nor time, nor eternity can ever dim<lb/>
its lustre! These things are left to<lb/>
me as &ldquo;my portion&rdquo; -- these are my<lb/>
treasures which I hide in my heart<lb/>
of hearts and defy the powers of worlds<lb/>
known and unknown to rob me of one<lb/>
&ldquo;jot or tittle&rdquo; of their preciousness!<lb/>
Possessed of such jewels as these, though<lb/>
lost in earth's dreariest desert, I could<lb/>
yet know some happiness.</p>
<p>But to retrace my steps a little.<lb/>
I was saying that the old year's de-<lb/>
parture was by me unobserved, yet<lb/>
when I awoke on the morrow and found<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01612006"/>
that such was the fact, many thoughts<lb/>
flooded my brain-thoughts similar<lb/>
to those expressed by yourself. Surely, if<lb/>
<hi>you</hi> have occassion for sadness, <hi>I</hi><lb/>
should forever hide my head from the<lb/>
light of day. Truly, I cannot recall<lb/>
a year so full of sorrow, and yet, in<lb/>
some respects, so happy, as the past<lb/>
one. Paradoxical as this may sound,<lb/>
it is nevertheless true. Anguish,<lb/>
remorse! oh! feeble words to express<lb/>
what I have almost daily experienced.<lb/>
God, Himself, can only know what<lb/>
tortures I have borne; by what &ldquo;dark<lb/>
waters&rdquo; I have sat! And in this mid-<lb/>
night of sorrow among the stars that<lb/>
shed a gladsome ray upon my<lb/>
path, there was one particularly<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01612007"/>
bright and beautiful- Can you not<lb/>
imagine to what I refer? Even to your<lb/>
acquaintance, which I trust may yet<lb/>
grow into true friendship. This re-<lb/>
minds me that just one year has passed<lb/>
since I first met you. Yes, one year<lb/>
ago, I visited your little city. I only<lb/>
trust that before another year has<lb/>
elapsed, I may possess your esteem<lb/>
more than I do at present; that I<lb/>
may conduct myself so fairly and<lb/>
honestly, that should anyone say, in<lb/>
your presence, that my words are<lb/>
flattering &amp; my statements deceptive,<lb/>
you would be prepared to deny the<lb/>
assertion, or, at least, <add>to</add> know in your<lb/>
own heart, that it was false.<lb/>
Since then the old year witnessed our<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01612008"/>
acquaintance, I still cling fondly to<lb/>
its memory with all its griefs and burdens-<lb/>
Its dark days I blot out from my re-<lb/>
membrance, to-night, and <add>only</add> recall its<lb/>
brightest moments. Thank Heaven, I can<lb/>
and <hi>do</hi> forget the things of the Past-<lb/>
My broken resolutions, my shattered<lb/>
hopes, all, all, I bury, and begin the<lb/>
New Year as free from care as a bird!<lb/>
Did I say free from care? Ah! no! one thought<lb/>
bids me recall that expression, and that is<lb/>
my lack of religion. Though in my early<lb/>
childhood it was my privilege to daily<lb/>
kneel and receive instruction at the feet<lb/>
of a Christian mother, now sainted; and<lb/>
though during my boyhood it was my<lb/>
good fortune to be surrounded by<lb/>
Christian influences; and from boyhood<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01612009"/>
to manhood to be guided by the wise<lb/>
consels of a kind father; yet I find my-<lb/>
self, to-night, far from leading a pious<lb/>
life. Would to Heaven that I could utter<lb/>
other words! But since I begun the Old<lb/>
Year by making so many good resolutions,<lb/>
&amp; e're it ended, had broken them all, I<lb/>
shall begin the present year with not so<lb/>
much as one. Perhaps it will be just<lb/>
as well. My only aim shall be to seek<lb/>
after truth and knowledge; to avoid<lb/>
the evil &amp; cleave to the good, and in all<lb/>
things, as far as <del>in</del> I am able, to conduct<lb/>
myself as a Christian man and a Southern<lb/>
gentleman. To follow the words of the Poet;<lb/>
&ldquo;who misses or who wins the prize,<lb/>
Go lose or conquer as you can;<lb/>
But if you fall or if you rise,<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01612010"/>
Be each, pray God, a gentleman&rdquo;!</p>
<p>I was glad to hear that<lb/>
Messrs Longfellow and Bryant arrived<lb/>
safely and proved acceptable. I am not<lb/>
sufficiently well acquainted with the wri-<lb/>
tings of either author to be able to refer<lb/>
to their best poems, but if my memory<lb/>
serves me correctly, there is a short<lb/>
poem by Bryant called the &ldquo;Rivulet&rdquo;<lb/>
which struck me as being very beautiful<lb/>
&amp; expressive. I know that I read it over<lb/>
&amp; over again &amp; each reading pleased<lb/>
me the more. If you will refer to it, I<lb/>
think you will agree with me as to<lb/>
its beauty. There were many others by<lb/>
the same Author which I much admired,<lb/>
but my treacherous memory does not<lb/>
permit me to recall them.<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01612011"/>
You will perceive, by noticing the<lb/>
number &amp; st. from which I write, that<lb/>
I have changed my residence. This<lb/>
occurred somewhat suddenly, though<lb/>
not unexpectedly. There had been an<lb/>
undercurrent of dissatisfaction between<lb/>
myself &amp; my most worthy landlady, dating<lb/>
from the time of my sickness. But I<lb/>
had hoped to avoid any open disturbance,<lb/>
&amp; bore with Job-like patience every un-<lb/>
pleasant word or act. This course of pro-<lb/>
ceedings conveyed no lessons of instruction<lb/>
to my landlady, but rather led her to think<lb/>
that I was <add>a</add> meek mortal upon whose<lb/>
neck she could place her foot, with<lb/>
impunity. Poor, deluded creature!<lb/>
She little dreamed that she <add>was</add> walking<lb/>
through a powder magazine with a <add>lighted</add><lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01612012"/>
match in her hand! But she knows bet-<lb/>
ter to-day, for I opened my mouth, at<lb/>
last, and she knows, this morning,<lb/>
what I think of Homeopathy, Unitarian-<lb/>
ism, Abolitionism, Spiritualism ect, for<lb/>
these are all included in her creed!<lb/>
But I leave her to an ignominious fate!<lb/>
I am very pleasantly located, so pleas-<lb/>
antly located that <add>I</add> really think <del>that</del><lb/>
I am ready &amp; willing that you should<lb/>
not abandon the use of &ldquo;metaphor&rdquo; in<lb/>
your letters! I am sure that I could<lb/>
understand you, freed, as I am, from<lb/>
my former annoyances. I should state<lb/>
that, out of consideration for the Board of<lb/>
Health, I have had my examination postponed<lb/>
to the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> day of February- You will please excuse<lb/>
all miserable scribbling, since I wrote with<lb/>
the paper on my lap.</p>

P.S.<lb/>
   The paper on which I write is so<lb/>
transparent, that, in order to protect<lb/>
the contents of my letter from the<lb/>
gaze of the <hi>curious</hi> (for there are such)<lb/>
I have thought it best to wrap<lb/>
about it an extra sheet.<lb/>
Sincerely yours,<lb/>
