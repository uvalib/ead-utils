<hi>No. 20.</hi><lb/>
<salute>My precious wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your sweet<lb/>
letter of July 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> came, last<lb/>
evening- Aunt J. Mott's and<lb/>
the cyclone are a <hi>great</hi><lb/>
pair! Give Sis Mottsey<lb/>
<hi>time</hi>, and she will come<lb/>
Moseying along after a<lb/>
while! Of course, she is<lb/>
going to stop long enough<lb/>
in the wild West to say<lb/>
howdy to old &ldquo;Brer Cy-<lb/>
clone&rdquo;! She is bound to be<lb/>
&ldquo;perlite&rdquo;! But she'll make<lb/>
her appearance! Trust her for that:<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02058002"/>
Have just had a telephone<lb/>
message from Lawrence.<lb/>
He is alright, only a little<lb/>
restless over not hearing<lb/>
from his Commission- There<lb/>
seems to have been some<lb/>
delay in the proceedings<lb/>
of the Board reaching<lb/>
Washington - Yesterday,<lb/>
we had the pleasure of<lb/>
entertaining Drs Durham<lb/>
&amp; Meyers, two English phy<lb/>
sicians, who have been<lb/>
sent out by the School<lb/>
of Tropical Medicine <add>at Liverpool</add>, to<lb/>
study yellow fever. They<lb/>
are going to Brazil, and<lb/>
came down to Havana<lb/>
just to make our<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02058003"/>
acquaintance &amp; to ascertain<lb/>
what, if anything, we had<lb/>
discovered. I enjoyed meet-<lb/>
ing them very much, as<lb/>
they were two of the most<lb/>
typical English men, &ldquo;don't<lb/>
you know&rdquo; that one could<lb/>
possibly meet. We have<lb/>
placed our laboratories<lb/>
at their disposal during<lb/>
the ten days they will be<lb/>
in Havana. I send my<lb/>
sweet little Farmer-lady<lb/>
a little sweet-pea which grows<lb/>
in large numbers on the<lb/>
parade. They look very<lb/>
pretty in the early morning.<lb/>
I hope that your row <add>of peas</add> are<lb/>
doing well and giving many<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02058004"/>
pretty bouquets for the Centre<lb/>
table- Don't let the <hi>mint-bed</hi><lb/>
suffer on account of the lack-<lb/>
of rain, sweet-heart, for<lb/>
I shall be very thirsty when<lb/>
I get back. <hi>Let Aunt Jane<lb/>
have the job of keeping it<lb/>
good and moist</hi>! It will <del>be</del><lb/>
give her some thing to keep<lb/>
her mind working, but<lb/>
don't let her begin <hi>to pull<lb/>
up any weeds</hi>! As a weed-<lb/>
puller, she is first-cousin<lb/>
to old Brer cyclone! You<lb/>
know that by experience!<lb/>
Keep her out of grotto Park!<lb/>
How I wish that some of the<lb/>
nice rain that is falling, this<lb/>
afternoon, could be sprinkling<lb/>
down on your garden and lawn!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02058005"/>
We have splendid showers<lb/>
nearly every afternoon<lb/>
and could spare lots of mois-<lb/>
ture for the drier parts<lb/>
of the earth- Some of the storms<lb/>
which <add>pass</add> out of sea, a few<lb/>
miles from the shore, are<lb/>
superbly grand! The <del><unclear>destroy</unclear></del><add>play</add><lb/>
of the lightning is something<lb/>
wonderful to see- Certainly<lb/>
August will be a <hi>wet</hi> month,<lb/>
since July has been so dry<lb/>
with you- It would be too<lb/>
bad to have our lawn much<lb/>
injured, but I suppose that<lb/>
there isn't much danger<lb/>
of that at this late day.<lb/>
I do hope that the <hi>well</hi> won't<lb/>
give out; but as you have<lb/>
not mentioned it, I suppose that<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02058006"/>
it is alright so far-<lb/>
<hi>Thursday morning</hi> - <hi>July 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>.<lb/>
How is the sweetest oomsey<lb/>
in the land this morning? Have<lb/>
you had a <hi>shower</hi> - bath yet?<lb/>
I have just emerged from<lb/>
mine and it was glorious!<lb/>
And such a beautiful morn-<lb/>
ing! Last evening, just before<lb/>
dinner, we took a drive over<lb/>
the new military road to<lb/>
Vedado and were chased home<lb/>
by a storm coming from<lb/>
sea-ward. After it passed,<lb/>
the air was so cooled, that<lb/>
I had to take off my linen<lb/>
blouse and put on my blue<lb/>
one that I came very near not<lb/>
bringing- Such a night for<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02058007"/>
sleeping, too! I get into my<lb/>
little couch at about 9.15 P.M.<lb/>
and snooze like a top until<lb/>
6 a.m.- And such an appetite<lb/>
as I manage to keep up is<lb/>
really surprising- Am getting<lb/>
a stomach on me like a St.<lb/>
Louis Brewer! I do believe<lb/>
that I have gained 5 lbs,<lb/>
since I arrived- Of course, I<lb/>
am dreadfully sun-burned; but<lb/>
that had taken place before<lb/>
I had been here a week.<lb/>
This morning, we will drive<lb/>
out to Havana in order to<lb/>
return the call of our Eng-<lb/>
lish Confre'res, who are stop-<lb/>
ping at La Florida Hotel.<lb/>
While there I must go to the<lb/>
Chief Quartermaster's office<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02058008"/>
and find out when the next<lb/>
Transport will leave New<lb/>
York for Havana- I have heard<lb/>
that one would leave on July<lb/>
25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, which would bring it here<lb/>
on July 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. If so, she would<lb/>
probably sail the next day<lb/>
&amp; reach New York about<lb/>
August 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- Wouldn't that<lb/>
be <hi>jolly</hi>? I hope that it is<lb/>
so, as I would like to see<lb/>
my precious children so soon<lb/>
again and would <add>also,</add> like to see<lb/>
what havoc the West Wind<lb/>
ha<del>d</del>s played with my fat Far-<lb/>
mer-lady's ranch. Much love<lb/>
to dear aunt Jane and to Helen-<lb/>
Regards to Mr Moore and Jacob-<lb/>
Take good care of your precious<lb/>
selves and don't sit up too late or<lb/>
rise too early! Boo! Boo! Kisses &amp; love<lb/>
for my darling girls-</p>

<salute>Devotedly,</salute>
