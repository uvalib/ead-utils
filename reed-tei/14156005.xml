<p>I feel that the sketch of Dr. Reed's<lb/>
life would not be complete<lb/>
<unclear>were</unclear> not some mention made<lb/>
of a pet c<del>h</del>at that for the<lb/>
last nine years of his life<lb/>
was a loving &amp; beloved member<lb/>
of our house hold. When we<lb/>
were first married Dr's <unclear>aser-<lb/>
sion</unclear> to the feline race was<lb/>
most pronounced, but as I<lb/>
would not give up the pets<lb/>
of my girl-hood he gradually<lb/>
became reconciled to their pre-<lb/>
sence &amp; finally as the years<lb/>
passed by he became quite<lb/>
as advocate of their much <del>as</del><lb/>
<unclear>maligned</unclear> intelligence &amp; affec-<lb/>
tion. Whenever orders came for<lb/>
the breaking up of our army<lb/>
home our cats would be given<lb/>
to people whom we fell assured<lb/>
would kindly care for them &amp;<lb/>
it was he who would most<lb/>
often secure our new pets.<lb/>
But of all the numerous<lb/>
cats we had, &ldquo;Flirt&rdquo; a beautiful<lb/>
tawny tobby held the peace of<lb/>
honor in our affections-<lb/>
He was a gift to our little <add>daughter</add><lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14156006"/>
2<lb/>
after our arrival in Washing-<lb/>
ton, when he was no more than<lb/>
a <unclear>wee</unclear> ball of fun. Although<lb/>
the entire family made a<lb/>
great pet of him his love<lb/>
for his master became more<lb/>
&amp; more pronounces as he<lb/>
attained his great size &amp;<lb/>
beauty- When the meals were<lb/>
served he was always at Dr's<lb/>
side, with his <unclear>first</unclear> paws upon<lb/>
the table, standing on his hind<lb/>
feet in confident anticipation-<lb/>
for he never failed to receive<lb/>
the loving caress in the shape<lb/>
of the choicest tid-bit from his<lb/>
beloved friend no matter hard<lb/>
how great the latter's haste<lb/>
might be- After dinner as we<lb/>
assembled in the library, al-<lb/>
though a bright &amp; warmly lived<lb/>
basket occupied a cosy corner<lb/>
by the open fire nothing would<lb/>
satisfy Flirt but Dr's lap, and<lb/>
often when I would remonstrate,<lb/>
knowing that the cat's heavy<lb/>
weight was too great a burden,<lb/>
Dr. Reed would look at me<lb/>
<del></del> with his sweet smile<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14156007"/>
3<lb/>
saying, &ldquo;but, mother, &lsquo;<hi>son</hi>&rsquo; wants<lb/>
to stay &amp; what can I do about<lb/>
it?&rdquo; In this way he would sit<lb/>
reading for hours, unless his book was<lb/>
too heavy &amp; then with an apol-<lb/>
ogy ge would gently lift the<lb/>
cat down.</p>
<p>During Dr. Reed's long absences<lb/>
from home occasionally some<lb/>
gentleman friend would call<lb/>
who evidently reminded Flirt<lb/>
of his master &amp; with a little<lb/>
cry of delight he would jump<lb/>
up in the visitor's lap &amp; settle<lb/>
himself in great comfort.<lb/>
Generally he would admit of<lb/>
no advances from strangers<lb/>
&amp; his tiger-like kiss was<lb/>
most unfriendly-</p>
<p>All through Dr's busy work<lb/>
in Cuba when his mind<lb/>
&amp; body were both under such<lb/>
a tremendous strain in the<lb/>
left hand corner on the front<lb/>
page of my tri-weekly letters<lb/>
would be, &ldquo;a kiss&rdquo; or my love<lb/>
to &ldquo;Doogy Johnson&rdquo; The last<lb/>
being a pet name of his<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14156008"/>
4<lb/>
bestow<del>ly</del> that in some way<lb/>
meant more to him than<lb/>
merely Flirt.</p>
<p>On one occasion the cat was<lb/>
fast asleep on a friend's<lb/>
lap in the 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> story of a board-<lb/>
ing house (our temporary home)<lb/>
where the sound of mens' voices<lb/>
had no disturbing effect upon<lb/>
his<unclear>ning not</unclear>. Suddenly<lb/>
there was the sound of Dr's<lb/>
voice in the front hall beloved<lb/>
(having just arrived in a late<lb/>
train after an absence of several<lb/>
months in Cuba) and with a<lb/>
lighting like spring down the<lb/>
<del>three</del><add><del>two</del></add> flights of stairs Flirt was<lb/>
the first to welcome him-<lb/>
loudly purring at his feet.</p>
<p>We always took him to our<lb/>
summer home, and after the<lb/>
first trip by sail he seemed<lb/>
to anticipate all of the pleasures<lb/>
that were awaiting him &amp; did<lb/>
not demur against being shut<lb/>
up in his basket-</p>
<p>Dr. took great delight in early<lb/>
rising while in his little visits<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14156009"/>
5<lb/>
to us from the city &amp; would<lb/>
take his love &amp; wend his way<lb/>
to the garden always accompa-<lb/>
nied by Flirt who followed him<lb/>
faithfully from plot to plot.<lb/>
When called in to breakfast Dr.<lb/>
would often say to me, &ldquo;Doogy<lb/>
&amp; I have had a beautiful time&rdquo;<lb/>
In all of our wanderings over<lb/>
the place the cat would be<lb/>
with us &amp; would cry to be car-<lb/>
ried in Dr's arms if the<lb/>
walk was too long- In our<lb/>
moon light strolls his little<lb/>
shadow would flit here &amp; there<lb/>
he sometimes running ahead<lb/>
&amp; then again right at Dr's feet.<lb/>
Sad summer and there <del>we</del><lb/>
were no week's end comings<lb/>
of his master to gladden<lb/>
all of our hearts, I knew<lb/>
that he too was a partaker<lb/>
of our summer, for his<lb/>
spirits left him and<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14156010"/>
6<lb/>
he would steal quietly away<lb/>
&amp; spend the day all alone<lb/>
in some spot that had never<lb/>
before been a favorite haunch<lb/>
of his-</p>
<p>That November he too was<lb/>
laid to rest and who<lb/>
knows but what it was of<lb/>
a broken heart - for had<lb/>
not he also lost his best<lb/>
loved friend &amp; protector?</p>
