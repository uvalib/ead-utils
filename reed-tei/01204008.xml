<salute>SIR.</salute>
</opener>
<p>I HAVE THE HONOUR TO SUBMIT THAT SINCE COMMUNICATING TO YOU MY OBSERVATION<lb/>
ON FORCED AEDES AEGYPTI BREEDING IN MUD PUDDLES I HAVE NOTICED THE FOLLOWING,<lb/>
WHICH MAY BE OF INTEREST TO YOU.</p>
<p>IN THIS COUNTRY THE POORER CLASSES MAKE THEIR HOUSES OUT OF POLES LASHED<lb/>
TOGETHER AND PLASTERED WITH MUD, WHICH THEY DIG OUT OF THE EARTH USUALLY<lb/>
A FEW YARDS AWAY FROM THE BUILDING, WHICH LEAVES A HOLE LIKE THE BEGINNING<lb/>
OF A WELL AND WHICH SERVES AFTERWARDS AS A REFUSE DUMP.</p>
<p>ONE OF THESE I CAME ACROSS ON JUNE 1st FOUR FEET DEEP WITH STRAIGHT EARTH<lb/>
SIDES AND CONTAINING 1 FOOT OF RAIN WATER.</p>
<p>THERE WAS NO DEBRIS IN THE WATER WHICH WAS MUDDY, AND FROM WHICH I PROCURED<lb/>
LARVAE, WHICH ON BREEDING OUT GAVE 13 CULEX FATIGANS, 2 MALE AND 3 FEMALE<lb/>
AEDES AEGYPTI AND 2 MALE A. NUMBUS (THEOBALD). THE WATER HAD A Ph OF 7.<lb/>
THE NEGRO WHOSE SHACK IT WAS, TOLD ME THAT THE HOLE HAD BEEN DUG A YEAR<lb/>
BEFORE AND THAT IT ONLY HAD HAD WATER SINCE THE FIRST OF MAY, AND VARIED<lb/>
IN DEPTH ACCORDING TO THE RAINS.</p>
<p>THE DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE WAS 7 YARDS, AND THERE WAS NO OTHER WATER NEARER<lb/>
THAN 30 YARDS, WHICH WAS OVER A HEDGE IN A NEIGHBOURS YARD, HE ONLY SLEEPING IN<lb/>
THE HOUSE, AND DOING NO COOKING AND, FROM HIS APPEARANCE NO WASHING.</p>
<p>I ALSO GOT AEDES AEGYPTI OVAE FROM THE EARTH SIDES 3in. ABOVE THE WATER<lb/>
FROM WHICH I BRED 4 MALES AND 1 FEMALE.</p>
<p>ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT A TECHNICAL MUD PUDDLE IT FULFILLS SOME OF THE<lb/>
CONDITIONS OF A MUD PUDDLE AND APPEARS TO INDICATE THAT THE AEDES AEGYPTI<lb/>
WILL BREED UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS IF NO OTHER WATER IS NEAR.</p>

<p>CAIXA POSTAL, N.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 41</p>
<p>THE WATER IN WHICH I BRED THE LARVAE AND OVAE WAS THE SAME WATER IN WHICH I<lb/>
FOUND THEM, AND HAD A TEMPERATURE OF 25 CENTIGRADE.</p>
<p>THE TYPE OF EARTH IS A SANDY DARK RED CLAY AND THE SIDES WERE PACKED HARD.<lb/>
MAY I ASK IF IT HAS BEEN NOTICED BEFORE THAT, ON BREEDING OUT FROM EGGS, THAT<lb/>
THERE IS NOT ONLY A CONSTANT PREPONDERENCE OF MALES, BUT ALSO THAT THE FIRST<lb/>
ADULTS ARE ALWAYS MALES?. MUCH LITERATURE IS NOT AVAILABLE HERE, BUT I THINK THAT<lb/>
THIS MAY HAVE A BEARING ON THE QUESTION OF THE <unclear>CESSATION</unclear> OF YELLOW FEVER AFTER<lb/>
A CERTAIN INDEX IS REACHED, IN TERMS OF THE LAW OF CHANCE.</p>
