<p>I am under the weather since Saturday<lb/>
morning, not sick, but with a surgical<lb/>
trouble, which I brought from Panama. It got<lb/>
worse suddenly &amp; I had a small operation done<lb/>
Saturday morning-<unclear>Coco&auml;ine</unclear>-&amp; am pretty<lb/>
well out of the woods now. Made sick call<lb/>
this morning. But I will not be entirely<lb/>
to my self<add>for</add>-say-for 7 or 10 days. It is a<lb/>
nuisance about not being able to attend<lb/>
to my flowers. I mind that most. The Roses<lb/>
<hi rend="underline">ought</hi> to have stopped blooming-but they<lb/>
have not. I got about 40 this morning<lb/>
&amp; same beautiful ones are Lyons &amp; a num-<lb/>
ber of Pres. Carnot 's, Killarney's &amp; Detroits.<lb/>
The Gladioli too are the best of any<lb/>

<p>Oh. I will send you the Geographic Mag-<lb/>

get a copy of the American Magazine<lb/>

<p>Dear L.</p>
<p>I enclose your Rxs. The mixing the <unclear>Sodu</unclear><lb/>
Bicarb &amp; the chloroform as you do it can-<lb/>
<hi rend="underline">n</hi>ot possibly have any effect</p>
<p>The <del>cii</del> acid mixt. is only 2&sol;3 as strong<lb/>
as the one you had-as I recollect it. Of<lb/>
the other, as I recollect, you took a full tea-<lb/>
spoonful only in emergencies-which was<lb/>
15 drops a teaspoonful of this is <hi rend="underline">10</hi> drops.<lb/>
Regulate your-dose then by what you<lb/>
need <hi rend="underline">20</hi> drops is not an excessive dose<lb/>
&amp; the acid can do <hi rend="underline">no</hi> harm except to your<lb/>
<hi rend="underline">teeth</hi>: Note that a <hi rend="underline">tea</hi> spoonful is <del>4 cub-</del><lb/>
<del>ic</del> <hi rend="underline">4</hi>. Cubic centimeters-in this bottle<lb/>
not <unclear>5</unclear> as in the last as I wrote this <hi rend="underline">Rx</hi> in <del>a-</del><lb/>
English measures: Hence <hi rend="underline">5</hi> C.C. of it is<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="fC0127020"/>
10+<unclear>10&sol;4</unclear> = <hi rend="underline">12&frac12; drops</hi>: Regulate your dose to 50 as<lb/>
to get <hi rend="underline">about</hi> <hi rend="underline">10</hi>. to if needed <hi rend="underline">15</hi> drops or <hi rend="underline">20</hi><lb/>
<hi rend="underline">at</hi> a dose.</p>
<p><del>I would take</del> As long as you have acid stomach<lb/>
or fermentation of (apparently) bacterial <del>or yeast</del><lb/>
(or yeasty)origin <add>in the morning before breakfast</add> I would take the spirits of<lb/>
chloroform in doses of 20 to 30 drops &amp; re-<lb/>
peat, if necessary to 2 or even 4 doses: <hi rend="underline">not</hi><lb/>
using too much water for this. That is you don't<lb/>
want to dilute it any more than enough to<lb/>
not burn your mouth or throat. It is a good<lb/>
germicide &amp; a slight stimulant. My recollection is<lb/>
that 12 drops of it contains 1 minim of chloroform<lb/>
so <hi rend="underline">36</hi> would be only 3 minim = 3 <hi rend="underline">water</hi> drops in size.<lb/>
I find see Dispensatory it is <hi rend="underline">6%</hi> chloroform. So <hi rend="underline">30 drops</hi><lb/>
contains <del>1.8</del> 1 8&sol;10 drops = 9&sol;10 of a minim chloroform. You can<lb/>
<hi rend="underline">t</hi>ake <del>4</del> 2 to 3. C. Centimeters without any damage<lb/>
If the <del>morning</del> fermentation or an empty stomach</p>

<p>Form 1765.</p>
<p>TREASURY DEPARTMENT.</p>
<p>doesn't stop get a little fine carbolic acid<lb/>
half an ounce or <hi rend="underline">one drachum </hi>is enough, &amp; take<lb/>
about <add>3 to</add> 5 drops in about 10 C.C. of water instead of<lb/>
the chloroform. I would give much if you were<lb/>
entirely well. Yet I am reasonably sure that<lb/>
<hi rend="underline">you</hi> can be made so</p>
<p>I think Ned is telling the truth<lb/>
am sorry you won't see the Whitings &amp; am<lb/>
sorry Mrs. Leys could not have you. Too<lb/>
<hi rend="underline">c</hi>rowded I judge.</p>
<p>I wrote yesterday, to Kinyoun: Anderson &amp; White<lb/>
that you would be in Washington. Am not sure<lb/>
White is there &amp; am afraid that the wives<lb/>
of the others may be out of towns also wrote to<lb/>
Glennan-telling him. I was entirely willing to<lb/>
go to H. or - anywhere else the Bureau thought neces-<lb/>
sary but whether I &ldquo;wished for this detail&rdquo; <unclear>getting</unclear><lb/>
his letter <del>deform</del> I could not say until I know<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="fC0127022"/>
more about it. Then gave him some<lb/>
general advice. I am in no <unclear>way</unclear> 1-<lb/>
verse to remaining here. I would have<lb/>
<hi rend="underline">one</hi> more year of flowers &amp; then I could<lb/>
forego them for a long while. It is like<lb/>
having ones &ldquo;fling&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You will be in Portsmouth before Tumb-<lb/>
sey returns I fear as I presume you will not<lb/>
stay long in Washington. You ought to tell<lb/>
Ethel that you know Straub &amp; if she told<lb/>
him you were there it would be all right.<lb/>
He is rather a big man-<del>he</del> in his corps now<lb/>
The representative of the Med. corps as the<lb/>
general staff. He is an able man too.<lb/>
Although he &amp; Dr. Gorgas never got along.<lb/>
Hasta la Vista carissima. Don't take up your<lb/>
time with long letters &amp; sent a letter or postal to<lb/>
<unclear>Miss Fox</unclear> who Ned says is <hi rend="underline">mad</hi> because Mrs. M. has heard<lb/>
from you &amp; not she herself.</p>
