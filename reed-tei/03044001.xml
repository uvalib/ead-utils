<salute>Dear Dr. Derivaux:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am wondering if there is anything we can do to<lb/>
expedite the forwarding of our postal cards from this office.<lb/>
I am extremely discouraged with this part of my work, first,<lb/>
by the Bureau sending the entire supply of cards here, and<lb/>
second- the wrangling I have with the Express Co., to call<lb/>
for the packages. I have phoned the Express Co., everyday<lb/>
since the 27th ult. and as yet they have never called. They<lb/>
tell me over the phone that they &ldquo;will call tomorrow&rdquo; but<lb/>
&ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; never comes. Yesterday they told me that it was<lb/>
not their fault if they could not get out this far, that if<lb/>
I wanted them to go any sooner than they could call I would<lb/>
have to send them to the Express office myself. I had the<lb/>
same trouble last month. They, then, reach the Doctors so<lb/>
late it is to be supposed that little attention is paid to<lb/>
the card.</p>
<p>If you attend the Malaria meeting please do<lb/>
not fail to speak of this work. There have been delays and<lb/>
confusion all along. <del><unclear></unclear></del><lb/>
Delay in printing cards; confusion in sending them to this<lb/>
office instead of to the Health Officers direct, the supply<lb/>
of which did not reach here until the first week of Sept. On<lb/>
Sept. 4, the June, July and August cards were reshipped to<lb/>
the respective states. If we are to take up this work for<lb/>
1919, I do hope that it can be handled more satisfactorily<lb/>
or else drop it altogether as the results do not seem to jus-<lb/>
tify the expense, time, etc.</p>
<p>I am in a quandary as to what to do about order-<lb/>
ing cards for next year. Dr. Carter said that he wanted to<lb/>
speak to Mr. Dublin, Statistician, in regard to the form he<lb/>
(Dublin) has for collecting statistical data, at the coming<lb/>
meeting, as he believes we can improve on the form we are now<lb/>
sending out. He just mentioned this off hand when I told him<lb/>
that it was now time to make our request for the supply for<lb/>
the coming year; the many interruptions and his sudden depar-<lb/>
ture prevented me from taking the matter up with him again.<lb/>
Do you think I should write Dr. Carter, asking that he advise<lb/>
positively if we are to defer making requisition until after<lb/>
the meeting. If you remember, the Bureau has requested that<lb/>
our order for cards be given at least two months in advance.<lb/>
If Dr. Carter has thought over the matter and decided not to<lb/>
change our form, I should like to get my requisition in at<lb/>
once.</p>
<p>Very best wishes, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely</salute>
