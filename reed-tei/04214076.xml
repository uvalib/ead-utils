DR. PHILIP S. HENCH<lb/>
DR. CHARLES H. SLOCUMB<lb/>
General Frank R. McCoy<lb/>
1633 - 31st Street, N. W.<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General McCoy:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I had a delightful time in Cuba. In order to organize the re-<lb/>
sults of my visit and largely for my own information, I wrote out a con-<lb/>
fidential memorandum which is chiefly personal; however, because of certain data<lb/>
therein, I had two or three extra copies made, one to show General Kean,<lb/>
one for General Truby and I should like to enclose a copy for you. You<lb/>
probably will not care to read it all but may I call your attention es-<lb/>
pecially to Page 10. I enclose some photographs with notes on the back and<lb/>
thought you would like to have the enclosed map which may bring back memories<lb/>
of former years.</p>
<p>General McCoy, I shall be in Washington May 11 and 12 in connection<lb/>
with the International Congress on Tropical Medicine. Would it be possible<lb/>
for me to spend some hours going over General Wood's diary in the Library of<lb/>
Congress? Will I need a letter from you introducing me to a certain official<lb/>
in the Library? I scribbled someone's name on a piece of paper in your office<lb/>
before I went to Cuba but I have misplaced it in the voluminous mass of data<lb/>
that I collected in Cuba. As I understood it, your secretary was going to write<lb/>
General Wood's daughter and get permission for me to peruse the diary and I<lb/>
should like to spend most of the afternoon of May 11, part of May 12 and pos-<lb/>
sibly also part of May 13 going over the diary.</p>
<p>I started to write you a card from Cuba, then couldn't remember your<lb/>
address. I enclose the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;. In Cuba I found some old photographs. I<lb/>
made photostatic copies of two of them which I enclose. The one photo was<lb/>
simply labeled &ldquo;General Scott and Mr. Steinhardt&rdquo;. Can you identify the<lb/>
officer in white? I don't imagine it is you but if it is, by all means keep<lb/>
one of these photostats. Are the furnishings of the parlor in the palace<lb/>
roughly as you remember them?</p>
<p>You will remember that I asked you to give me your opinion as to<lb/>
whether General Wood actually was largely responsible for having Surgeon<lb/>
General Sternberg appoint the Yellow Fever Board. This was news to me until<lb/>
I saw the enclosed photostats. I would appreciate it greatly if you would<lb/>
send me for my files just a comment, perhaps a paragraph on that; as I under-<lb/>
stand it, you believe that General Wood did make this suggestion to Sternberg.<lb/>
I hope to find corroborating evidence thereof in Wood's diary.</p>

<p>April 29, 1948</p>
<p>The other point we discussed was a statement that on two occasions<lb/>
Reed was about to be recalled to Washington but Wood &ldquo;saved&rdquo; Reed for the<lb/>
yellow fever work. I never saw that statement anywhere else and have run<lb/>
across no memoranda, telegraphic or written orders or other confirmatory<lb/>
data in my perusal of the records of Reed, Sternberg and others in the National<lb/>
Archives</p>
<p>I enclose a carbon of a letter I have written to the Minister of<lb/>
Public Works regarding the preservation of Camp Lazear. I hope they will<lb/>
really do something about it now.</p>
<p>General McCoy, if you have the time and inclination, I would be<lb/>
extremely grateful if you could dictate an additional paragraph of your<lb/>
recollections concerning General Wood's interest in Reed's work and of your<lb/>
own relationship to it as budget officer for General Wood.</p>
<p>Incidentally, why was the building next to General Wood's office<lb/>
called the Segundo Cabo? Nobody in Cuba seems to know.</p>
