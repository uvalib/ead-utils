BACKGROUND OF EVENTS<lb/>
------------------------<lb/>
BY PAUL V. COLLINS.<lb/>

<p>Dean Swift little thought that he<lb/>
was speaking more truth than poetry<lb/>
when he wrote:</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Naturalists observe a flea</l>
<l>Hath smaller fleas that on him prey.</l>
<l>And these have smaller still to bite 'em.</l>
<l>And so proceed ad infinitum.</l>
</lg>
<p>That was written nearly two cen-<lb/>
turies ago, but it waited until the<lb/>
last decade for verification by men<lb/>
of science.</p>
<p>Pasteur demonstrated more than<lb/>
40 years ago the foundations of bac-<lb/>
teriology, proving that ferments and<lb/>
putrification did not produce new ani-<lb/>
mal life, as was generally taught up<lb/>
to that time, but that everywhere<lb/>
there exisited bacteria, with great<lb/>
functions in nature, producing<lb/>
changes in matter, causing diseases,<lb/>
but sometimes contributing invaluable<lb/>
aid in food production. Pasteur's dis-<lb/>
coveries set scientists at work along<lb/>
entirely new lines of research, but<lb/>
neither he nor his successors for 30<lb/>
years after his demonstration knew<lb/>
that the immeasurably small bac-<lb/>
teria which play such a part in dis-<lb/>
ease themselves have parasites like<lb/>
&ldquo;smaller fleas to bite 'em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>One of the greatest achievements<lb/>
in medical research since Pasteur's<lb/>
day was accomplished by a Washing-<lb/>
tonian, Dr. Henry Rose Carter, as-<lb/>
sistant surgeon general of the United<lb/>
States Public Health Service, who<lb/>
died in this city a fortnight ago. In<lb/>
the official review of Dr. Carter's<lb/>
career, issued by the Public Health<lb/>
Service, following his death, it is<lb/>
stated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the most notable of his<lb/>
sanitary and scientific achievements<lb/>
may be mentioned: The determination<lb/>
of the period of extrinsic incubation<lb/>
of yellow fever, a foundation on which<lb/>
the brilliant work of Walter Reed and<lb/>
his commission rested, and for which<lb/>
Dr. Carter was nominated for the<lb/>
Nobel prize by the distinguished Eng-<lb/>
lish physician and sanitarian, Maj.<lb/>
Donald Ross. He was intimately as-<lb/>
sociated with Gorgas and Reed<lb/>
throughout the greater part of their<lb/>
careers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Gen. Gorgas and Dr. Walter<lb/>
Reed testified to the greatness of Dr.<lb/>
Carter's work as a pioneer in finding<lb/>
the secret of yellow fever, the mos-<lb/>
quito, as the host carrying the fever<lb/>
germs. Kitasato, the famous Japa-<lb/>
nese scientist, says of Dr. Carter's<lb/>
work: &ldquo;It is the only advance in mari-<lb/>
time quarantine since the time of the<lb/>
Venetians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>What wonders have really been<lb/>
accomplished in sanitation and pro-<lb/>
longation of human life in recent<lb/>
years! The Carter achievement,<lb/>
based on Pasteur's work, is one ex-<lb/>
ample. Other research has combined<lb/>
to raise the average life from 39.8<lb/>
years, in 1855, to 55 years and 2<lb/>
months in 1920. Science thus donates<lb/>
16 years, on an average, to all humans<lb/>
in civilized countries.</p>
<p>The United States Public Health<lb/>
Service, as is pointed out by its chief,<lb/>
Dr. Cummings, has eradicated small-<lb/>
pox in the Philippine Islands, where<lb/>
it had been epidemic for centuries;<lb/>
has controlled cholera in the same<lb/>
region, and completely annihilated it<lb/>
in continental United States. It has<lb/>
checked bubonic plague in California,<lb/>
Texas, Louisiana and Florida. It has<lb/>
helped demonstrate the transmission<lb/>
of typhus fever by body parasites. It<lb/>
has given the first demonstration that<lb/>
beriberi was caused by eating polished<lb/>
rice, deficient in certain vitamines.<lb/>
It has shown that the plague was<lb/>
kept alive by germs carried by ground<lb/>
squirrels. It has developed a method<lb/>
of treating oysters from polluted beds<lb/>
so as to make them safe for food.<lb/>
It has identified the American hook-<lb/>
worm and, by the Carter research,<lb/>
conquered yellow fever.</p>
<p>We no longer fear cholera or small-<lb/>
pox, yet as late as 1873 there was a<lb/>
serious cholera epidemic in the United<lb/>
States, and it was a novel idea put<lb/>
forth by Dr. Woodworth, supervising<lb/>
surgeon of the Marine Hospital Serv-<lb/>
ice, in his report to Congress, to the<lb/>
effect that cholera came from &ldquo;unor-<lb/>
ganic poison gaining entrance through<lb/>
the alimentary canal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1902 there were in the Philippines<lb/>
166,252 cases of cholera with 109,461<lb/>
deaths. In that year 4,000,000 died<lb/>
of cholera in India. So thoroughly<lb/>
has the disease been conquered that<lb/>
while in 1911 many ships arrived bear-<lb/>
ing cholera cases, only two cases re-<lb/>
-------------------------------------<lb/>
sulted in Brooklyn, one in New York<lb/>
and two in Boston.</p>
<p>All these medical victories are attrib-<lb/>
uted directly to bacteriology.</p>
<p>No less serious than cholera was<lb/>
yellow fever. Prior to the Civil War<lb/>
yellow fever was continuous in New<lb/>
Orleans and other Southern cities,<lb/>
so that it was assumed to be endemic<lb/>
there. While the disease cannot be<lb/>
traced back earlier than the seven-<lb/>
teenth century, in 1793 it killed one-<lb/>
tenth of the population of Philadel-<lb/>
phia and one-twentieth of the people<lb/>
of New Orleans. In 1905 an epidemic<lb/>
of yellow fever in New Orleans killed<lb/>
one-tenth of the patients. Then Dr.<lb/>
Carter began his investigations, re-<lb/>
sulting in proving that a mosquito<lb/>
was the carrier of the germ, and the<lb/>
wholesale killing of mosquitoes has<lb/>
saved millions of human victims of<lb/>
the scourge. Yellow fever is wiped<lb/>
out.</p>
<p>Now comes a recent discovery that<lb/>
mankind has an ally in the fight<lb/>
against the bacteria germs of disease.<lb/>
It is called &ldquo;bacteriophage,&rdquo; which<lb/>
means, literally, that it is something<lb/>
which &ldquo;eats up bacteria,&rdquo; a parasite<lb/>
of bacteria which destroys them. This<lb/>
was not known prior to 1917, and is<lb/>
scarcely yet recognized even by ad-<lb/>
vanced scientists as an important fac-<lb/>
tor in future fighting of disease.</p>
<p>Entomologists have long recognized<lb/>
that the best way to fight an insect<lb/>
pest is to make use of the natural<lb/>
enemies of the insect. Sanitarians<lb/>
will, by research, discover possibilities<lb/>
of fighting microbes by the &ldquo;smaller<lb/>
fleas to bite 'em.&rdquo; Like Paul Jones,<lb/>
they &ldquo;have just begun to fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>The first publication regarding bac-<lb/>
teriophages was in 1917, by Monsieur<lb/>
F. d'Herelle of the Pasteur Institute,<lb/>
Paris, and the first English transla-<lb/>
tion of the book. &ldquo;The Bacteriophage:<lb/>
Its Role in Immunity,&rdquo; was published<lb/>
in 1922 by George H. Smith, Ph. D., of<lb/>
Yale University.</p>
<p>To illustrate briefly the action of<lb/>
bacteriophage, the test was made with<lb/>
two specimens of water containing<lb/>
&ldquo;vibrio cholerae.&rdquo; The first specimen,<lb/>
filtered through porcelain, contained<lb/>
2,500 organisms per cubic centimeter;<lb/>
after three hours no organism re-<lb/>
mained. The second specimen was fil-<lb/>
tered and boiled. The boiling killed the<lb/>
enemy of the bacteria--the bacterio-<lb/>
phage--so that, starting with 5,000,<lb/>
after three hours it contained 10,000;<lb/>
after 40 hours, 36,000. The water of<lb/>
the Jumna River in India, during the<lb/>
last cholera epidemic, left the town<lb/>
of Agra containing 100,000 germs per<lb/>
cubic centimeter, but 5 kilometers<lb/>
downstream it had so purified itself<lb/>
by its bacteriophage that it contained<lb/>
only 90 to 100 per cubic centimeter.</p>
<p>Until 1915 such cleansing was<lb/>
thought to be due to &ldquo;a volatile some-<lb/>
thing in the water which disappeared<lb/>
by boiling.&rdquo; Now it is recognized to<lb/>
be &ldquo;ultramicrobes,&rdquo; called bacterio-<lb/>
phage, so infinitely small that not<lb/>
even when dyed can they be seen<lb/>
through any microscope, even though<lb/>
microscopes can make visible the elec-<lb/>
trons of an atom.</p>
<p>Just as bacteria are made more<lb/>
virulent by scientific cultures, so a<lb/>
new possibility may be found in de-<lb/>
veloping the enemies of all microbes<lb/>
by culture of bacteriophage until they<lb/>
will be so powerful as to be able to an-<lb/>
nihilate any germs. That opens a new<lb/>
method of attack of disease without<lb/>
drugs.</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>All animals (including humans) are<lb/>
loaded with bacteria, at all times, but<lb/>
each animal contains resistance pow-<lb/>
ers against his own bacteria--subject<lb/>
to being overpowered in cases of physi-<lb/>
cal weakness. But one man's mi-<lb/>
crobes, thus held harmless upon him,<lb/>
may be virulent if transferred to an-<lb/>
other person who is unimmunized<lb/>
against it. Hence the danger of<lb/>
coughing in the presence of other per-<lb/>
sons, which might carry <unclear>germs to</unclear><lb/>
them. Russian Soviets are reported<lb/>
recently to have forbidden all hand-<lb/>
shaking and kissing because of the<lb/>
danger of the practice.</p>
<p>A surgeon connected with the<lb/>
United States Public Health Service<lb/>
is authority for the statement <unclear>that it</unclear><lb/>
is more important to glove the hands<lb/>
than it is to wear a mask in surgical<lb/>
operations. With the mask the sur-<lb/>
geon is obliged to touch it more or<lb/>
less with his hands, each touch carry-<lb/>
ing germs to the mask. With gloves<lb/>
on the hands, handshaking is warned<lb/>
off. He agrees with the Russians that<lb/>
handshaking is dangerous.</p>
<p>It has long been argued that public<lb/>
handshaking by the President, or by<lb/>
other public men, should be abolished<lb/>
from a sanitary standpoint. The same<lb/>
is applicable to promiscuous hand-<lb/>
shaking and kissing, at least unless<lb/>
accompanied with a sufficient regi-<lb/>
ment of active bacteriophages to at-<lb/>
tack the germs, for every little germ<lb/>
has a bacteriophage of its own.</p>
