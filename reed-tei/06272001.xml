DR. ARISTIDES AGRAMONTE<lb/>
CALLE K. ENTRE 15 Y 17<lb/>
VEDADO, HABANA <date value="1928-03-12">Mar 12th, 1928</date>

Col. J. R. Kean, U.S. Army, Ret.<lb/>
Army Medical Museum,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Col. Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It has been a great pleasure to me to read the<lb/>
report made by you to the Committee on Military Affairs, upon<lb/>
the Copeland-Wainwright Bill. Please accept my heart-felt thanks<lb/>
for the kind and just manner in which you handle that part<lb/>
referring to my connection with<del>t</del> the Army Board's work.</p>
<p>I had knowledge of this Bill since March and always thought<lb/>
that it was rather illogical in rewarding the men who had already<lb/>
been paid for their part, in the same measure as the Members of<lb/>
the Board who had received no special reward for theirs; but,<lb/>
of course, it was not my place to meddle in the matter, which,<lb/>
after all may have a more political that philanthropic spirit.</p>
<p>When the pension was proposed for Mrs. Wood in our Congress,<lb/>
it did not meet with a single dissenting vote. We must recognize, how-<lb/>
ever, that as far as generosity and open-heartedness is concerned, the<lb/>
Nordic cannot compare with the Latin character. I, also, have my<lb/>
doubts as to the Bill becoming a Law at any time, much as such<lb/>
a thing would mean to me.</p>
<p>At the meeting of the American College of Physicians, (New<lb/>
Orleans, March 5th to 10th,) I gave an address that received an<lb/>
ovation, the evening of the fifth, upon a &ldquo;Review of Yellow-fever<lb/>
Research&rdquo; and on the ninth I read a paper (&ldquo;Considerations upon<lb/>
the Etiologic Agent in Yellow fever&rdquo;) in which I laid Noguchi's<lb/>
<hi>leptospira</hi> in its grave, alongside of Sanarelli's <hi>bacillus</hi> and<lb/>
Seidelins <hi>Pyroplasma</hi>. The work of Stokes, Bauer and Hudson, in<lb/>
West Africa, where they have done with Asiatic monkeys what we<lb/>
did with our human subjects, without finding <hi>leptospira icteroi-<lb/>
des</hi>, is most conclusive. Dr. Stokes must have died from an acci-<lb/>
dental mosquito bite, <del><unclear></unclear></del> the insect having been in-<lb/>
fected either from the experimental monkeys or from a case of<lb/>
yellow fever. Blood, unless purposely sent into the circulation,<lb/>
will not produce infection; otherwise, &ldquo;fomites&rdquo; would be infect-<lb/>
ive and nobody can accept that now, I am sure.</p>
<p>It will please you to know that, while in New Orleans, I re-<lb/>
ceived the Degree of Doctor of Laws from Tulane University; also<lb/>
a gold placque, from the N. O. Association of Commerce and a life<lb/>
membership. Everybody was extraordinarily kind and made my stay<lb/>
in the Gulf City a never-to-be-forgotten week.</p>
<p>With best wishes, I remain, gratefully,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours,</salute>
