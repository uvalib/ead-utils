<p>1. See bottom page 6 -</p>
<p><unclear>Gorgas</unclear> had nothing to do with the physical cleaning of<lb/>
Havana during the year 1899 or until Feb. 10, 1900. He was<lb/>
Chief Surgeon but the Sanitary Officer reported not to him<lb/>
but directly to General Ludlow. He never at any time had<lb/>
anything to do with cleaning the streets which was under<lb/>
General (then Major) Wm. M. Black, C.E.</p>
<p>2. See page 10 -</p>
<p>Carroll's infection was not due to carelessness but<lb/>
was a carefully planned and executed inoculation. He was<lb/>
bitten at 2 p.m., August 27, 1900 by a mosquito who had<lb/>
bitten a severe case of yellow fever on the second day of<lb/>
the attack 12 days before. See Reed's Preliminary Note p.8.</p>
<p>3. See page 10 -</p>
<p>No Cubans. They were all believed to be immune.</p>
<p>4. See page 11 -</p>
<p>The military surgeons, Reed, Havard and Kean were<lb/>
quite familiar with the modus operandi of the warfare<lb/>
against mosquitos. This warfare had been begun at Quemados<lb/>
on Oct. 15, 1900 and in the other military camps around<lb/>
Havana in consequence of G.O. No. 6 Dept. of Cuba Dec. 21st<lb/>
which was before the conversion of Gorgas. His acceptance<lb/>
of the role of the mosquito as of importance was certainly<lb/>
after Feb. 1st, 1901. Mosquito work in Havana began in<lb/>
March, 1901.</p>
<p>5. See page 20 -</p>
<p>Dr. Chas. A. L. Reed's visit was not fortuitous though<lb/>
very fortunate. He was sent down by Secretary Taft.</p>
<p>6. See page 29 -</p>
<p>General M. W. Ireland was Surgeon General at the time<lb/>
of the Armistice, November 11, 1918. General Gorgas was retired<lb/>
under law when he reached his 64th Birthday on October 3, 1918.<lb/>
He was placed on active duty from October 4th to December 1st so<lb/>
that he could write his report, etc. but not as Surgeon General<lb/>
or having any authority of command.</p>
<p>7. See page 27 -</p>
<p>There is no record in the Adjutant General's Office or the<lb/>
Surgeon General's Office of his having been made an Honorary<lb/>
Major General in the British Army.</p>
