My dear General Truby:</p>
<p>I was sure I had written you something about my Cuban trip, and am<lb/>
much ashamed to find that I did not. Let me tell you briefly that <hi>without<lb/>
a shadow of doubt</hi> we located Camp Lazear and the remains of Building #1,<lb/>
rickety but still standing. I bought the building and hope to raise money<lb/>
to buy the rest of Camp Lazear site and properly memorialize it. I have<lb/>
had a few repairs made (very carefully) to the building. I enclose some<lb/>
photographs which I took inside and outside the building. The governmental<lb/>
authorities in Cuba completely accepted my report; Ramos wrote me a typical<lb/>
sugary Cuban letter. Doctor Recio, secretary of sanitation, viewed the spot<lb/>
and building, and enthusiastically endorsed our verification. I will write<lb/>
later more of my plan to raise money.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, let me send you (what I was sure I had sent) a copy of<lb/>
my Cleveland talk and a copy of a photo taken at the unveiling. <hi>Please<lb/>
<unclear>return</unclear> the photo</hi>, but keep the talk. However, it will be published with<lb/>
colored illustrations in Hygeia in October, and I will send you as many<lb/>
reprints as you wish. By the way, two days after the Cleveland affair<lb/>
Kissinger had a stroke and nearly died. He has made a pretty good recovery<lb/>
and is now walking about the house some.</p>
<p>Thanks loads for helping on the matter of a name for the anonymous<lb/>
figures in the painting. They may not accept our suggestions, but we gave<lb/>
'em! I just heard again from General Kean, who favors inserting Pinto<lb/>
rather than Ames, but he told Kellogg that he would abide by your sugges-<lb/>
tion favoring Ames.</p>
<p>As always, gratefully yours,<lb/>
P. S. Hench, M. D.<lb/>
psh:pw<lb/>
Enc.<lb/>
P. S. How is your manuscript coming? Can I help in any way? Do<lb/>
you have a publisher?</p>

Addendum:</p>
<p>As you may have noticed I found Dr. Lazear's death certificate made<lb/>
out by you. This I found in the National Archives. You may not have a<lb/>
copy and I had one made for you. When I was in Havana I saw an advertisement<lb/>
in the Havana papers of the Trotcha Hotel. I recalled the happy times you<lb/>
had had (at the Trocha Hotel in 1900, noted in your manuscript). I asked<lb/>
Moran if it could be the same despite the slightly different spelling.<lb/>
In our wanderings we drove around there and talked to the present <unclear>pro-<lb/>
prietor</unclear>. He said it was the same old hotel so for auld lang syne I took<lb/>
a snapshot of it for you. Do you recognize it? It is now almost completely<lb/>
filled with European exiles, domiciled in Cuba or waiting to come to the<lb/>
U. S. (It is at 7th and 2nd St., Vedado, I think).</p>
<p>With the help of an architect-friend here I am trying to transpose<lb/>
the old buildings of Columbia Barracks onto the current (1940) map of the<lb/>
Military Hospital, Ciudad Militar so that all those interested in medical<lb/>
history will know exactly where Reed's laboratory, the officers' quarters,<lb/>
etc. were in relation to the buildings now there. When I get this done, I<lb/>
will send you the result.</p>
<p>I was delighted with the frank and helpful comments you and Gen.<lb/>
Kean wrote on my Hemmeter photostats. When I see you this next spring I'll<lb/>
tell you of the very strange reception I got from Carroll's son. Have you<lb/>
ever read Dominguez' book on Finlay? It is in French but I have an English<lb/>
translation and if you'd care to read it I'll lend it to you gladly.</p>
