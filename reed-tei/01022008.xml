<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have, in a measure, answered the question in your letter of<lb/>
March 2nd. in my Memorandum to the I. H. B. of the same date, enclosing<lb/>
nearly the same letter from Pareja.</p>
<p>There is this in continuation to be said:</p>
<p>1/ The report of the cases is too defective to allow much of a<lb/>
conclusion to be based on it.</p>
<p>That all save one occurred in seranos and all occurred in what<lb/>
one might call the endemic yellow fever zone of Ecuador might seem sus-<lb/>
picious of yellow fever. On the other hand, there is nothing to show<lb/>
how long these people have lived in that zone and thus we can formu-<lb/>
late no idea whether they have been immunized (by previous attack of<lb/>
yellow fever).</p>
<p>There was yellow fever at Santa Rosita also in 1918 or '19, whence<lb/>
Peru is believed to have derived it, but this place has not been habit-<lb/>
ually infected.</p>
<p>2/ We do not know whether these cases (ictero-hemorrhagica)<lb/>
have only occurred in this Stegomyia infested area. The statement a-<lb/>
bout Dr. Arcos at Quito rather implies the contrary, but it is only an<lb/>
implication. Of course, if he is finding the same disease on the high-<lb/>
lands of Ecuador it would negative, for them at least, the diagnosis of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01022009"/>
<p>yellow fever.</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>3/ The fact that, from the grouping of the cases, there is no<lb/>
evidence of one leading to (infecting) another, if reasonable investi-<lb/>
gation has been made, would go far to negative yellow fever. If these<lb/>
reports were made in good faith--there is no questioning Pareja's in-<lb/>
tegrity--and search has been made for secondary cases, I would count the<lb/>
diagnosis of yellow fever negatived. It may be, however, that some<lb/>
Ecuadoreans would be loth to report yellow fever on account of the com-<lb/>
mercial damage that would be done. Americans, as you know, have felt<lb/>
the same way in the U. S.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think--I say this with some reserve, however,<lb/>
that a number of physicians are looking for ictero-hemorrhagica and<lb/>
therefor seeing it.</p>
<p>I am enclosing a copy of a second letter from Dr. Pareja. I<lb/>
have Carbos' reprint.</p>
<p>In the hospital cases, I wonder if the first date given is the<lb/>
date of attack or that of entrance to hospital? I presume the date<lb/>
of attack, but the 6th. case rather implies the latter. Naturally, any<lb/>
certain deduction from the duration of the dying cases is dependent on<lb/>
this knowledge.</p>
<p>If it be yellow fever or any communicable disease it should show<lb/>
up very soon--indeed should have done so before, because no Stegomyia<lb/>
work has, I think, been done in the out-lying places--Milagro: Bucay etc.-<lb/>
and one would suppose that since 1919 they would have accumulated a cer-<lb/>
tain number of susceptible people.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
Enclosure.<lb/>
