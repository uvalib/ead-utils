<p>Kean disagrees with Hench's proposal for the yellow fever painting. He also describes Finlay as an honest man but lacking a truly scientific mind.</p>

<salute>My dear Dr Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been a very poor correspondent<lb/>
lately. I have not been well, and the income tax<lb/>
has been a burden for so poor a man. Mrs. K. has<lb/>
besides this house a couple of little ones which the<lb/>
rents and so Rents &amp; Royalties with its schedules of depre-<lb/>
ciation, repairs, mortgates, &amp;c. has been a headache.<lb/>
But that is now over, tho. there is another for the city<lb/>
due at the end of the month. I have just waked<lb/>
up to the fact that you will start in your journey<lb/>
a week from Today so I will get this off by<lb/>
air mail today to wish you <hi>Bon Voyage</hi>. Your<lb/>
last letter was <add>rec'd</add> on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and you had not re-<lb/>
ceived <del>my</del> of course my letter mailed on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
inclosing my letter to his Exc. Dr. Domingo Ramos<lb/>
and the copy of your memo. for him which is so<lb/>
complete and convincing as to remove any<lb/>
possibility of doubt on the question at issue.<lb/>
The Copy of the True <unclear>Comies</unclear> came yesterday and<lb/>
was interesting and very amusing. To see<lb/>
Lazear without his black beard &amp; dead old Dr.<lb/>
Finlay, who was 67 in 1900, looking like a young<lb/>
Cavalry man &amp; without his side whiskers (Burnsides)<lb/>
which he always wore, pointing at that large<lb/>
mosquito (which is by the way an anopheles, standing on<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06302028"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
2<lb/>
her head to bite, and not a stegomyia) But the essen-<lb/>
tial points are near enough to the truth to be very<lb/>
educational. As regards Mr. Kellogg and Mr. Corn-<lb/>
well and the proposed picture I am of an uncer-<lb/>
tain mind. As a picture I cannot see Walter<lb/>
Reed arranged with his assistants, as if for a photo-<lb/>
graph, with Lazear putting the mosquito on Carroll.<lb/>
The historical verities are too much opposed to<lb/>
such a picture. I cannot but feel that Cornwell has<lb/>
the best group if he will only have Lazear (who was the<lb/>
mosquito expert) by Reed's side, both of them full<lb/>
face, while Dr. Finlay might be in profile and Dr.<lb/>
Delgado omitted. I wonder if Carroll &amp; Agramonte<lb/>
were really with Reed on that occasion? It doesn't<lb/>
matter though, they would have to be in the picture<lb/>
anyhow. As an artistic group I see always in<lb/>
my mind's eye Reed talking to General Wood<lb/>
in the embrasure of the palace window on Oct. 12<lb/>
and telling him that the mystery of the ages has been<lb/>
solved. But of course we cannot leave out Finlay<lb/>
and Lazear and we cannot put them into<lb/>
that picture. I ran across a letter which I<lb/>
wrote 14 years ago to Dr. Gorge Le Roy the Editor of<lb/>
Le Boletin Oficial de Sauidad on the Finlay-Reed<lb/>
controversy, and I am surprised to see how<lb/>
accurately it expresses my feeling Today.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f06302029"/>
<p>3</p>
<p>I am now not quite as positive that he may not<lb/>
some how have a case of yellow fever among his<lb/>
104 experiments, the Jesuit Padre Urra, or another,<lb/>
as I was there and I have been intending to take<lb/>
a day or two off and study Dr. Finlay's very<lb/>
careful and honest records. He was an absolutely<lb/>
honest man in every way, but was given to<lb/>
wishful thinking and lacked the wary scepticism<lb/>
of the truly scientific mind. I could tell you of some<lb/>
amusing instances if I could see you &amp; have a chat.<lb/>
His claim that the bites of <hi>unripe</hi> infected stegomyia<lb/>
would cause immunity, or a very wild immunizing<lb/>
fever, is I think disproved by several of the cases<lb/>
of which he had cognizance-Moran for instance<lb/>
who was bitten twice in Nov. but was not immune on Dec 21<lb/>
when he went into Building No. 2. Of course too he had<lb/>
to stretch his period of incubation to excessive length<lb/>
(25 days) to bring in some of them. But he was an<lb/>
excellent clinician and his diagnoses was usually<lb/>
accepted by the other members of the yellow fever Board<lb/>
while they yet rejected his mosquito theory.<lb/>
I am sorry that you have not been able to carry<lb/>
out your original plan of going via San Francisco.</p>
