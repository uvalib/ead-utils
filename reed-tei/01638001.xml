<salute>My darling Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wonder if<lb/>
you have received the vari-<lb/>
ious epistle that I have in-<lb/>
dited to you since the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
day of this month. When you<lb/>
write tell me just what let-<lb/>
ters you have received, so<lb/>
that I may know whether<lb/>
any are lost or not. Believe<lb/>
me, I have been very prompt,<lb/>
for how could I be other-<lb/>
wise when I regarded it<lb/>
as such a pleasure to<lb/>
write to my dear little E.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01638002"/>
Bless your sweet life! you<lb/>
are not forgotten, if you are<lb/>
far away by the waters<lb/>
of the &ldquo;amber-colored&rdquo; Meher-<lb/>
rin- and I look forward<lb/>
with eagerness to the day<lb/>
for writing to you-</p>
<p>In my last letter I said<lb/>
that I would give you<lb/>
some description of my<lb/>
Post in my next- I trust<lb/>
that I may be able to give<lb/>
you some slight idea<lb/>
by the following descrip-<lb/>
tion. The fort stands on<lb/>
Long Island &amp; hence on the<lb/>
Southern side of Long Islan<add>d</add><lb/>
Sound- The Sound, at this <del>part</del><lb/>
part, is not more than 1<lb/>
mile wide &amp; on the opposite<lb/>
shore from us is Fort<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01638003"/>
Schuyler, another military<lb/>
Post- On the immediate<lb/>
shore stands a large<lb/>
granite fort some 600<lb/>
ft. in length- In the rear<lb/>
of this &amp; rising to a greater<lb/>
altitude are earth works,<lb/>
at least 100 ft. in thick-<lb/>
ness at the base &amp; the<lb/>
top about 30 ft. thick-<lb/>
These earth works are<lb/>
beautifully turfed &amp; the<lb/>
latter is kept so nicely<lb/>
trimmed that it <add>has the</add> appear-<lb/>
ance of a green carpet-<lb/>
These works are protetced<lb/>
by immense cannon &amp;<lb/>
from their top can be<lb/>
obtained a most en-<lb/>
chanting view- Below<lb/>
you lies the Sound, cov-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01638004"/>
ered with sailing vessels<lb/>
of every description, while<lb/>
in the distance may be<lb/>
seen the beautiful pala-<lb/>
sades of the Hudson River.<lb/>
A short distance away &amp;<lb/>
on either side of willet's<lb/>
Point is a bay, which adds<lb/>
much to the beauty of the<lb/>
scene- Leaving the fortifi<lb/>
cations &amp; the water, we<lb/>
trace our way for a dis-<lb/>
tance of about 500 yards<lb/>
&amp; reach the barrac<add>k</add>s &amp; Offi-<lb/>
cers' Quarters- The Offi-<lb/>
cers' Quarters are built<lb/>
on the three sides of a<lb/>
level &amp; nicely turfed <del>sqare</del><lb/>
square- On the south side<lb/>
stands the Residence of the<lb/>
Commanding General-<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01638005"/>
<del>and</del> on the <del>the</del> east side,<lb/>
there are 4 dwellings for<lb/>
officers &amp; on the west side<lb/>
2 others for the same- All<lb/>
of these dwellings are 3 story<lb/>
frame buildings &amp; are <del>are</del><add>all</add><lb/>
double houses- So that<lb/>
there are in each house<lb/>
two complete sets of rooms-<lb/>
Each set consisting of eight<lb/>
rooms- Each house has<lb/>
a wide veranda extending<lb/>
around the front &amp; two<lb/>
sides,- which adds very<lb/>
much to their appearance-<lb/>
The residences are in fact<lb/>
quite pretty &amp; as good<lb/>
as I should ever care<lb/>
to own- There is a very<lb/>
nice walk &amp; roadway ex-<lb/>
tending around the <add>central</add> square,<lb/>
which is also bisected<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01638006"/>
by a gravel walk- This<lb/>
ground serves as the par-<lb/>
ade ground, where each<lb/>
evening I witness the par-<lb/>
ade &amp; hear the music of an<lb/>
excellent band- On the north<lb/>
side of the square, but removed<lb/>
to a considerable<del>e</del> distance<lb/>
are the barracks for the sol-<lb/>
diers- Taking all in all, Willet's<lb/>
Point is a beautiful place-<lb/>
The grounds are large -- are<lb/>
well laid off &amp; decorated<lb/>
with shade trees of various<lb/>
kinds- I am told that it is<lb/>
regarded as one of the most<lb/>
desirable posts in the<lb/>
service. One thing is quite<lb/>
certain &amp; that is I am<lb/>
more than<del>e</del> pleased &amp; would<lb/>
like to remain several years.<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01638007"/>
My duti<del>s</del>es are very light-<lb/>
I rise in the morning at<lb/>
6.30 o'clock &amp; attend the &ldquo;sick-<lb/>
call.&rdquo; The bugle sounds &amp; those<lb/>
men who are sick are broug<add>ht</add><lb/>
to the Hospital by the Sear-<lb/>
geants of their respective com-<lb/>
panies, and are there pre-<lb/>
scribed for- I next go around<lb/>
my Hospital wards &amp; see<lb/>
the few patients who are sick<lb/>
enough to be confined to their<lb/>
beds- The number of sick is<lb/>
very few, as the post is de-<lb/>
cidedly a healthy one. After<lb/>
sick call, comes breakfast-<lb/>
Between breakfast, at 7 to<lb/>
8 A.M. &amp; lunch from 12 <add>M.</add> to 1 P.M,<lb/>
I have nothing to do- In fact<lb/>
nothing else during the<del>n</del><lb/>
entire day- Dinner comes<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01638008"/>
at 7 P.M. We live well &amp; the gen-<lb/>
tlemen composing the mess are<lb/>
quite agreeable- Most of the Of-<lb/>
ficers at the Post have called<lb/>
on me- One of them came by with<lb/>
his buggy &amp; horse &amp; gave me a<lb/>
very pleasant ride. I live in<lb/>
the same house with Dr Byrne,<lb/>
my senior, &amp; find him very pleas-<lb/>
ant- We have 8 rooms, which<lb/>
are sufficient, if a body can't<lb/>
get any more! I do not have<lb/>
to drill except on Sunday<lb/>
Inspection- I have become<lb/>
quite used to my military<lb/>
clothing &amp; feel just like an<lb/>
old soldier- Have an abun-<lb/>
dance of time <del>e</del>for reading &amp;<lb/>
have already got well to work-<lb/>
will write on Monday &amp; will then<lb/>
tell you some good news-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Goodbye, my darling- Ever your<lb/>
devoted</salute>
