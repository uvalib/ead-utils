<hi>Friday night</hi>,<lb/>
<dateline>
Columbia Barracks,<lb/>
<date value="1901-01-18">January 18, 1901.</date>

<salute>My precious wifie dear:</salute>
</opener>
<p>What was that<lb/>
you were telling me about your fine<lb/>
weather in the U. S. in your last letter<lb/>
of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>? Well, surely you have<lb/>
had a touch of winter now, for yes-<lb/>
terday, a norther, accompanied by a drench-<lb/>
ing rain, set in, and oh! ye little<lb/>
fishes! how it did blow last night!<lb/>
I thought certainly that the roof would<lb/>
come off! To-night, as I write, I am<lb/>
sitting in my room with my over-<lb/>
coat on, while the termometer stands<lb/>
at 64&deg;! Now doesn't that sound<lb/>
perfectly absurd, that a mortal<lb/>
should need an overcoat at 64&deg;?<lb/>
Nevertheless, it is true on this<lb/>
Pearl of the Antilles- The wind<lb/>
blows so constantly that it cools<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02424002"/>
one off until his marrow-bones<lb/>
fairly chill! This morning, when I<lb/>
want in to take my shower-bath, the<lb/>
water was so cold that it made<lb/>
me fairly yell- Tomorrow, if the sun<lb/>
comes out, it will be so warm<lb/>
that we will <add>soon</add> forget all about<lb/>
our <hi>blizzard</hi>! In the meanwhile,<lb/>
you must have been having it<lb/>
dreadfully cold in the States. Do pray<lb/>
keep your toes warm this kind<lb/>
of weather- Don't bother any more<lb/>
about my coming by way of Tam-<lb/>
pa- The other route is alright &amp;<lb/>
I will get through in very good<lb/>
shape I am sure- You must<lb/>
know that I am a better sailor<lb/>
than I used to be- What a <hi>fashionable</hi><lb/>
lady, not to be rising until 10 o'clock<lb/>
in the morning- Great Scott! I<lb/>
get up at 7 a.m. every day! I am<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02424003"/>
certain that you must have en-<lb/>
joyed Maud Adams so much- How<lb/>
I would like to have seen her with<lb/>
you and the fat girls- I refer, of course,<lb/>
to Miss Lucy and Miss Anna-polis-<lb/>
Did you give our sweet scholar, mother<lb/>
dear, <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>1.00 for her dear father? Don't for-<lb/>
get that, for her report richly de-<lb/>
serves it- We hear that the Army<lb/>
Reorganization bill has passed the<lb/>
senate! I only get 4 files, but that<lb/>
helps out about one year in my<lb/>
promotion, so I am not going to<lb/>
growl any- I would <add>have</add> liked 14 files<lb/>
better- But we must be satisfied<lb/>
with what we get. It's too bad<lb/>
that you are having La Grippe<lb/>
again in Washington- I wonder if<lb/>
it is really true- I do so hope that<lb/>
you and precious joy will escape-<lb/>
Why shouldn't our good friend, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02424004"/>
Hoff be made Surgeon General? He<lb/>
would make an excellent one-<lb/>
He came to Washington to take D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
Bushnell's place, and since the latter<lb/>
had to go, on account of his health,<lb/>
a better selection could not have<lb/>
been made- I hear that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bache<lb/>
is not well at all- I am so sorry<lb/>
to hear it- He is such a nice, com-<lb/>
panionable man- Well, I have finished<lb/>
writing the paper which we will pre-<lb/>
sent here in February -- and am glad<lb/>
to get it off my hands -- our last cases<lb/>
are now Convalescent- Am going down<lb/>
to see Gen. Wood on business in the<lb/>
morning -- and to give him a short abstract<lb/>
of our results for his annual Report,<lb/>
Good-night, you sweet joys! Take<lb/>
good care of your darling selves<lb/>
during this <add>cold</add> weather- Boo! Boo! Love<lb/>
&amp; kisses &amp; kisses &amp; love for my precious,<lb/>
precious girls-</p>
