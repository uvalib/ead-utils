<salute>Dear White:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Lyster was here last night and this is what he said:</p>
<p>That he regarded the district of Tuxpan as the most dangerous<lb/>
area now left in Mexico. Not Tuxpan itself, but the area adjacent<lb/>
thereto between the mountains and the sea: That he regarded it as<lb/>
having been a permanent endemic area, like that on the Papaloapam<lb/>
River: That he had sent Vaughan into this district in 1920, but had<lb/>
to draw him out on account of the outbreak in British Honduras and<lb/>
had intended to send him and at least one--if possible two others--<lb/>
back into the Tuxpan district until it was cleared up.</p>
<p>He spoke of it being a hard country to live in and very difficult<lb/>
to get about in after the rains begin and said that he thought your<lb/>
plan would be to concentrate as many men as you could in this district--<lb/>
<hi>brigadas volantes-</hi>-and press the Stegomyia control during the dry<lb/>
weather, holding, as he said you are doing, the districts of Vera Cruz<lb/>
and Tampico with indices below the point of fever spreading if intro-<lb/>
duced: That you could take men from distant sectors, clear of yellow<lb/>
fever and not in communication with this district, for this work.</p>
<p>I am telling you all this, not knowing what it may be worth to<lb/>
you, or if it be worth anything. You should be able to evaluate it.<lb/>
I, naturally, cannot.</p>
<p>Lyster was not &ldquo;knocking.&rdquo; He came to consult me about writing<lb/>
a paper on yellow fever for the next meeting of the American Tropical<lb/>
Society--asked for by Dock--and decided not to do so. He spoke most<lb/>
highly of you. He seemed, and I believe is, as much interested in<lb/>
the elimination of yellow fever as you are or as I am.</p>

<p>am.</p>

<p>I am leaving for a few days' stay in N. C. to-morrow night, but<lb/>
hope to be back in time to see you while you are in Washington.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly your friend,</salute>
</closer>
