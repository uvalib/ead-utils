<salute>Dear Miss Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your very kind letter<lb/>
enclosed with our from your father<lb/>
came to me as I was starting on a<lb/>
tour of the Northern cities of Brazil, as<lb/>
far as <unclear>Mansos</unclear>.</p>
<p>I had just time to answer Dr Carter<lb/>
in regard to Schistomiasis. Mansoni<lb/>
and wait until my return to answer yours.<lb/>
It was with mixed feelings that it left<lb/>
me to made my tour of study.</p>
<p>Your happy pride in Dr Carter's pride<lb/>
in &ldquo;carrying on&rdquo; to the end, gave birth<lb/>
to a silent vow within myself-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01227021"/>
C1<lb/>
B2<lb/>
but it also filled me with a realization of<lb/>
a great common loss which we shall<lb/>
sustain, and personally, a lasting regret<lb/>
that should be mine were I not to have<lb/>
his blessing before his last <unclear>great</unclear><lb/>
adventure into the unknown.</p>
<p>What the others of us have felt. I know not-<lb/>
but without the encouragement of his letters<lb/>
and example in his disheartening fight,<lb/>
not so much against Aedes Aegypti as<lb/>
against ignorance and prejudice, I think<lb/>
I should have given up.</p>
<p>My first meeting with Dr Carter was by proxy<lb/>
in Mobile, Alabama, in 1923. When I was<lb/>
inspecting the Anti-mosquito measures in that<lb/>
city. I had been challenged to find a breeding<lb/>
place showing larvae, by one of the inspectors<lb/>
who had worked under your father, (another<lb/>
Scot. whose name I cannot recall), and had<lb/>
almost abandoned the search, but finally<lb/>
late in the day, came upon one, much to my<lb/>
National brother's disgust, who stamped his<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01227022"/>
feet and said. &ldquo;Man you're as bad as<lb/>
Dr Carter&rdquo; What greater compliment could<lb/>
a young mosquito knight have had? in<lb/>
fact. I felt I had won my golden spurs.<lb/>
Since then the ideal has been to try and<lb/>
<unclear>enumerate</unclear>.</p>
<p>I have just heard of Darlings death in<lb/>
beautiful <unclear>Beyrouth</unclear> which I know well.<lb/>
I owe him much and feel his loss very<lb/>
personally, for it was he who set my feet on<lb/>
the path, a great gap has been made<lb/>
in the front ranks</p>
<p>And alas there seems few to take the<lb/>
places of the great Yellow fever Crusaders.<lb/>
So few who love the fight for the fights<lb/>
sake, as they did and do and yet always<lb/>
kept the Second Commandment as their<lb/>
watch word.</p>
<p>That I shall, as soon as I reach New York<lb/>
take my way to Washington as to a<lb/>
Mecca, needs no saying and that it shall<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01227023"/>
be to sit at the feet of the man who inspired<lb/>
and not to lay a humble tribute on a grave,<lb/>
is my earnest hope.</p>
<p>I cannot express to you how much your<lb/>
letter meant, and is meaning to me, it was<lb/>
so thoughtful in the most of your really<lb/>
sacred labours, and so needed by the one<lb/>
who received it for the <unclear>instruction</unclear> &ldquo;be not<lb/>
<unclear>ye weary</unclear> with <unclear>well</unclear> doing&rdquo; needs constant<lb/>
reiteration in this sad land.</p>
<p>I hope <unclear>shortly</unclear> to see my other hero Dr White<lb/>
who is such a Stonewall Jackson to our<lb/>
small army with the yellow flag he has<lb/>
given a high significance to that colour.<lb/>
but for his sake I wish the fight were over in<lb/>
Brazil.</p>
<p>With sincere and respectful remembrances to<lb/>
Dr Carter and my best compliments to<lb/>
yourself.</p>
