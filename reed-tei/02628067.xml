<p>Agreement between the History of Yellow Fever<lb/>
and its Transmission<lb/>
By the Culex Mosquito (Stegomyia of Theobald)<hi rend="superscript">1) y 2)</hi></p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>The early history of yellow fever, notwithstanding the scarcity and<lb/>
vagueness of the data referring to the first 150 years after the discovery<lb/>
of America enables us to establish a very plausible connection between the<lb/>
earliest undoubted epidemics of yellow fever, described by Du Tertre and by<lb/>
Cogolludo in the fourth decade of the seventeenth century, and the previous<lb/>
ones which, under the names of &ldquo;plague&rdquo;, &ldquo;pestilence&rdquo; and &ldquo;malignant<lb/>
fevers&rdquo;, usually attacked the newly-arrived Spaniards at Santo Domingo,<lb/>
Terra Firma and Vera Cruz, ever since the conquest of Mexico in 1519, as<lb/>
also between those same fevers and the &ldquo;modorra-illness&rdquo; or &ldquo;pestilential</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>1) Read on Feb. 19, 1902, before the Pan American Sanitary Congress.<lb/>
A pamphlet.</p>
<p>2) My own experiments of yellow fever inoculation, ever since 1881, when I<lb/>
decided to submit my mosquito theory to a practical test, have always been performed<lb/>
with the domestic day mosquito of Havana. I had previously consulted the distin-<lb/>
guished Cuban naturalist, D. Felipe Poey, about the classification of the samples which<lb/>
I showed him, and the informed me that from similar samples which he had taken to<lb/>
Paris in 1817 or 1820, the species had been named &ldquo;culex mosquito&rdquo; by Robineau<lb/>
Desvoidy. D. Felipe had previously called the insect &ldquo;mosquito de Cuba&rdquo; (Cuban<lb/>
mosquito). The experiments made by Drs. Reed, Carroll, Agramonte and Lazear were<lb/>
started in June, 1900, with a brood hatched from eggs of the identical insect which,<lb/>
at Dr. <hi>Lazear's request</hi>, I had handed to him. All the successful experiments have<lb/>
hitherto been made with that particular mosquito.<lb/>
&check;<lb/>
<add>I carried<lb/>
them <unclear>to Lazear<lb/>
(Carter)</unclear></add></p>
<p>From a medical point of view. it would be quite illusory to admit, <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>, that<lb/>
other mosquitoes, whose external and functional characteristics differ materially from<lb/>
those of the culex mosquito of Desvoidy, share with the latter the faculty of trans-<lb/>
mitting yellow fever, even though they should happen to belong--from the naturalist's<lb/>
standpoint--to a common group or species, such as the Stegomyia fasciata, of Theobald.</p>
<p>So far as I can judge from the written descriptions by former classifiers, the<lb/>
culex mosquito (Desv.) culex teniatus (Wied.), and culex elegans (Fic.) represent but<lb/>
one identical insect, and must therefore be considered as the &ldquo;yellow-fever mosquito&rdquo;.<lb/>
About the other synonyms included in the Stegomyia fasciata species, in the absence<lb/>
of direct experiments of inoculation, the faculty of sexual reproduction between males<lb/>
and females classed under different headings, should be resorted to before prejudging<lb/>
their capability of transmitting the disease.<lb/>
