<title>Letter from John M. Gibson to Philip Showalter Hench, September 24, 1951</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Gibson discusses his research on Sternberg. He thinks that Sternberg, along with Gorgas, was at first skeptical about the mosquito theory. However, he reconsidered that view before Reed went to Cuba. Like Hench, Gibson has not seen any confidential notes between Sternberg and Reed concerning the Yellow Fever Board.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciate your letter of September 21, which has just arrived.<lb/>
And of course I was much interested to learn that you were at work on a book<lb/>
on the history and final conquest of yellow fever.</p>
<p>I have turned up a great deal of material on Sternberg since I have<lb/>
been at work on this research, but, frankly, I have done very little more<lb/>
than pick up items of interest here and there and store them away. And<lb/>
there is still a great deal of ground for me still to cover. I have hardly<lb/>
had an opportunity to stand off and take a good look at the man and his achieve-<lb/>
ments as a whole.</p>
<p>My impression, however, is that Sternberg was skeptical of the mosquito-<lb/>
transmission theory for a long time, along with Gorgas and many others. But my<lb/>
impression <add>also</add> is that, somewhere, I have seen a speech of his showing that he<lb/>
thought of that mode of transmission some time before Walter Reed and the others<lb/>
went to Cuba. I am also pretty strongly under the impression that he expressed<lb/>
himself as believing, or half-believing, that a submicroscopic organism was<lb/>
responsible for yellow fever.</p>
<p>At the present stage of my researching, I am afraid I cannot give you<lb/>
any satisfactory answers to any of the four questions you asked. My impression,<lb/>
however, is that the Yellow Fever Board was Sternberg's idea. (At least his friends<lb/>
give him credit for it.) As you know, he spent some time in Havana some years be-<lb/>
fore he became Surgeon General and traveled extensively to explode other men's<lb/>
theories about the origin of the disease. He is credited with entertaining serious<lb/>
doubts about the Sanarelli bacillus, even though it had been given the blessing of<lb/>
two or three U.S. medical authorities, and he is said to have organized the Yellow<lb/>
Fever Board primarily for the purpose of finding out who was right, he or Sanarelli.</p>
<p>I have seen no confidential notes between Sternberg and Reed concerning the<lb/>
creation of the Yellow Fever Board. I do not know whether any are in existence.<lb/>
But I am inclined to agree with you that most of the communications between them<lb/>
was on an informal, word-of-mouth basis. I have nothing yet in the way of messages<lb/>
between them while Reed was in Cuba. I was hoping that your store of Reed material<lb/>
would fill that yawning gap.</p>
<p>I certainly cannot blame you for not wishing to let someone else publish<lb/>
letters which will prove extremely valuable to your own book. However, if you<lb/>
have any material that you know definitely you will not use (if such a thing is<lb/>
possible), I'll welcome it. And, if I can be of any assistance to you without im-<lb/>
pairing my own work, I'll be happy to.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
