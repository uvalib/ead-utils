<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am still carrying your letter back and<lb/>
forth to the house wanting to write you personally,<lb/>
and now comes this other one from you in New York<lb/>
City. I find the surest way to write is to write<lb/>
immediately and I want to add a few notes in answer<lb/>
to this letter.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the dope on the<lb/>
shows. I have seen &ldquo;Life with Father&rdquo;, and your<lb/>
reports on &ldquo;George Washington&rdquo; and &ldquo;Louisiana Purchase&rdquo;<lb/>
confirm what I have heard. I do want to see Ed Wynn<lb/>
in &ldquo;Boys and Girls Together&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In answer to your question about the article.<lb/>
The purpose of this article is not to reproduce your<lb/>
speech on Lazear. The purpose of it is to publicize<lb/>
your discovery of the shack, the information about it,<lb/>
and your plan for the building of a memorial in the<lb/>
hopes that it will excite interest and perhaps<lb/>
support. In dealing with newspapers, no one can tell<lb/>
how much they would publish, but I should think that<lb/>
six hundred words would be the outside limit and that<lb/>
four hundred and fifty would be more likely to get in.<lb/>
I think that it might be possible to get a couple of<lb/>
cuts in our Red and Black and I am sure that we could.<lb/>
Then we could have the reprint which you suggest with<lb/>
both the article and the cut, and as many such reprints<lb/>
as you would want. My suggestion would be to see what<lb/>
you could do in a paper dispatch type of article written<lb/>
in the third person about yourself and this cabin and<lb/>
the memorial plan in about six hundred words, sending<lb/>
the photographs which you would choose to have in with<lb/>
it, say two of them, and we will try to get a nice setup<lb/>
in the college paper reproduced also in the town paper,<lb/>
and then as many reprints as possible. We will also<lb/>
send it out to other papers and see if we can get it on<lb/>
the associated press wire.</p>

<p>I have sent a memorandum to Mr. Brewer today<lb/>
telling him that he is to send you five copies of each<lb/>
of the photographs.</p>
<p>Your discoveries in the New York Public Library<lb/>
are perfectly amazing. You ought to be in the research<lb/>
business exclusively.</p>
<p>We all send our regards to you and I will be<lb/>
writing more later. I am working hard now getting ready<lb/>
for our semi-annual Board Meeting.</p>
