<p>EXPLAINS FLYING<lb/>
RESISTANCE OF<lb/>
MOSQUITOES</p>
<p>Malaria Mosquito Will Fly Against<lb/>
8-Mile Breeze For Distance of<lb/>
Two Miles and Across Mile of<lb/>
Open Water, Dr. Byrd Claims</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>That the malaria mosquito or<lb/>
Anopheles will fly against an eight-<lb/>
mile breeze for a distance of two<lb/>
miles across a mile of open water,<lb/>
is the conclusion reached by Dr.<lb/>
J. L. Byrd, Health Officer of Cris-<lb/>
tobal - Colon, after extensive flight<lb/>
observations at Manzanillo Island.<lb/>
Data from a paper ready by Dr. Byrd<lb/>
before the 198 meeting of the Med-<lb/>
ical Association of the Canal Zone<lb/>
at the Ancon Hospital May 18, on<lb/>
the anti-malarial campaign at<lb/>
Cristobal-Colon, was obtained Sat-<lb/>
urday at Balboa Heights.</p>
<p>Dr. Byrd pointed out that Cris-<lb/>
tobal-Colon once known as one of<lb/>
the most unhealthy seaports in the<lb/>
world, is situated on Manzanillo<lb/>
Island, near the Atlantic entrance<lb/>
to the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>Once a Tidal Swamp</p>
<p>The Island was once a tidal<lb/>
swamp but has been largely filled.<lb/>
In 1905 General Gorgas and his<lb/>
co-workers eradicated yellow fever<lb/>
from this area and by 1917 the<lb/>
anti-malaria works had been extend<lb/>
ed to about half a mile from the<lb/>
inhabited section. This belt was<lb/>
thoroughly sanitated, all vegetation<lb/>
being kept closely trimmed, the<lb/>
swampy areas were either filled or<lb/>
drained and the drains oiled at re-<lb/>
gular intervals of seven days. This<lb/>
eliminated anopheles breeding from<lb/>
Manzanillo Island and the adjoin-<lb/>
ing part of Mount Hope District.<lb/>
Nevertehless, malaria continued.</p>
<p>On investigation it was found<lb/>
that countless numbers of anophe-<lb/>
lines were being bred in the ex-<lb/>
tensive swamps which surround the<lb/>
city on three sides and during 1917.<lb/>
<hi>1918 and 1919 appeared in such</hi><lb/>
quantities on the screens at Colon<lb/>
Hospital and the Washington Hotel<lb/>
at the beginning of the rainy sea-<lb/>
son and for the following three<lb/>
months that it was necessary to<lb/>
detail a laborer to kill them with lar-<lb/>
vacide applied with a knapsack<lb/>
spray.</p>
<p>These mosquitoes came from the<lb/>
swamps two miles distant across<lb/>
Manzanillo Bay, a mile of open<lb/>
water. Flight observations clearly<lb/>
indicate that they would fly against<lb/>
an eight mile breeze for a distance<lb/>
of two miles. The drainage of these<lb/>
swamps by sea-level canals in 1920-<lb/>
21 did away with this annual vis-<lb/>
itation of anophelines. Very little<lb/>
oil was used in controlling mos-<lb/>
quito breeding in the swamps in<lb/>
question. Trochas (paths) six feet<lb/>
wide were cut through the swamp<lb/>
at intervals of 50 yards and- sea<lb/>
level drains about eight inches wide<lb/>
dug along their center. The drains<lb/>
were kept free of vegetation. This<lb/>
method was not expensive and has<lb/>
proven very effective, malaria be-<lb/>
ing successfully controlled and prac-<lb/>
tically eradicated from Cristobal-<lb/>
Colon.</p>
