<salute>Dear Mrs. Reed.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your: Very, welcome<lb/>
letter was received.</p>
<p>I, canot begin to tell you<lb/>
how pleased Mr. Kissinger was<lb/>
to hear from you,<lb/>
he is not able to write<lb/>
only. a very little so I have<lb/>
to do his coresponding for<lb/>
him he is feeling real<lb/>
poorly at present.</p>
<p>has a cold and <unclear>act</unclear> to<lb/>
me like the flue.</p>
<p>We are very glad Indeed.<lb/>
That Prof: Peabody gave you<lb/>
our adress.</p>
<p>We feel that he is a<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03106002"/>
very good friend and.<lb/>
spending lots of his<lb/>
very valueble time in<lb/>
our behalf.</p>
<p>Mr. Kissinger has always<lb/>
been an admirer of<lb/>
Major Reed and had<lb/>
felt had he lived things<lb/>
would have been very<lb/>
different- Than they are<lb/>
we have had some very<lb/>
nice letters from Dr. Agramonte<lb/>
of Cuba. The only one that<lb/>
is living of. the yellow<lb/>
fever board.</p>
<p>he has offered any<lb/>
service or Influence<lb/>
he might have in our behalf,<lb/>
you say you have had.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03106003"/>
to bear the Indifrence.<lb/>
of Congress. It Seems' to bad<lb/>
and great <unclear>pity</unclear> that Congress<lb/>
cannot see or seem to<lb/>
realize what these men<lb/>
have given<lb/>
<hi>No</hi> not for one moment<lb/>
does Mr. Kissinger regret<lb/>
that he had the privalage<lb/>
of Voluntering himself. To<lb/>
Major Reed for the experiment<lb/>
but <unclear>re Joieces</unclear> in his own<lb/>
heart that he had a little<lb/>
part in helping. Medical<lb/>
Science and Humanity<lb/>
but does regret that his<lb/>
health is such that he<lb/>
has to depend on the <unclear>governed</unclear><lb/>
and friends for our<lb/>
suport, for he has felt<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f03106004"/>
at times as though he<lb/>
had lost his Citizenship<lb/>
because he dare not<lb/>
express his opinion in<lb/>
regards to some acts of,<lb/>
the <unclear>Gavment</unclear>.<lb/>
or for what he regards<lb/>
as right such. as upholding<lb/>
the <unclear>Lazear</unclear> Law, he fought<lb/>
against that <hi><unclear>Demon of Liymana</unclear></hi><lb/>
and the friends of It said<lb/>
they would cause him, Trouble<lb/>
and It seems' as if the<lb/>
ones' in Washington was only<lb/>
to glad to listen to them-<lb/>
and placed him under<lb/>
Humiliation,</p>
<p>Mr. Kissinger heard last<lb/>
eve that one of the Boys that<lb/>
was in the <unclear>expemet</unclear> had just<lb/>
died- in Chicago but did<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f03106005"/>
not find out which one,<lb/>
we, are having a real.<lb/>
cold spell and snow. <unclear>storm</unclear><lb/>
but have had very nice<lb/>
weather.</p>
<p>now dear Mrs Reed we,<lb/>
were both very glad to hear<lb/>
from you and hope we may<lb/>
have another letter, from you<lb/>
this letter seems' to me, mixed<lb/>
up but Its rather hard<lb/>
to write for some one else<lb/>
so hope you excuse. all the<lb/>
mistakes.</p>
<p>Mr. Kissinger joins me<lb/>
in Kinds regards and<lb/>
best wishes.</p>
