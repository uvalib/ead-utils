<p>Reed is astonished that yellow fever remains unrecognized at Pinar del Rio. He recommends measures taken to avoid an epidemic, and the use of human experimentation to study the disease.</p>

<salute>My dear Gen. Sternberg;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I returned<lb/>
from Pinar del Rio, on Sunday<lb/>
evening, where I had gone at<lb/>
the earnest request of Dr<lb/>
Stark and Gen. Lee- I suppose<lb/>
that Stark has already written<lb/>
you about the stupid blunder<lb/>
in diagnosis of which God-<lb/>
frey and his assistants, at<lb/>
Pinar del Rio Barracks, have<lb/>
been guilty- It seems bad<lb/>
enough when medical officers<lb/>
insist upon confounding<lb/>
Typhoid fever and malaria;<lb/>
but when they deliberately,<lb/>
in spite of symptoms, fail-<lb/>
ure of quinine, and the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02064002"/>
presence of distinctive Post-<lb/>
mortem lesions present in<lb/>
every case, persist in calling<lb/>
Yellow fever &ldquo;pernicious<lb/>
malarial fever&rdquo;, and that, too,<lb/>
on the Island of Cuba in the<lb/>
month of June, it about<lb/>
reaches the sublimest heights<lb/>
of obtuseness! Agramonte<lb/>
had already preceded me<lb/>
and had autopsied one case,<lb/>
in the presence of these med-<lb/>
ical officers, and had found<lb/>
marked fatty degeneration of<lb/>
liver and fluid blood in stom-<lb/>
ach &amp; upper Intestine.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, Godfrey<lb/>
&amp; A.A. Surg. Presnell, upon<lb/>
my arrival, had the sublime<lb/>
impudence to tell me that<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02064003"/>
they wished it distinctly<lb/>
understood that they differed<lb/>
with Dr Agramonte &amp; still con-<lb/>
sidered these cases as pernicious<lb/>
malarial fever! At 3 o'clock,<lb/>
the afternoon of my arrival,<lb/>
Agramonte &amp; I autopsied<lb/>
the Commissary Serg't, who had<lb/>
died after <add>a</add> 3 days illness-<lb/>
The stomach contained consid-<lb/>
erable black-vomit material<lb/>
&amp; the liver was typical--<lb/>
body fairly well jaundiced-<lb/>
In the presence of this case,<lb/>
these gentlemen reluctantly<lb/>
yielded- I find that the<lb/>
cases (11 had died) had all<lb/>
presented unmistakable symp-<lb/>
toms of yellow fever, except<lb/>
in the matter of albumen<lb/>
in the urine, which test<lb/>
Godfrey had left in the hands<lb/>
of one of his steward's, who<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02064004"/>
was quite incompetent for<lb/>
the work. Of course it <hi>was</hi> pres-<lb/>
ent, but under such a careless<lb/>
arrangement, was not detec-<lb/>
ted till during the last days of<lb/>
life, when any idiot could have<lb/>
found it- These cases had<lb/>
been treated in the wards<lb/>
of the hospital like other<lb/>
patients, without any particular<lb/>
disinfection of bed-linen &amp; clothing<lb/>
except that on the bed, when the<lb/>
patient died, in the latter case,<lb/>
sheets &amp; pillow slips went into<lb/>
bichloride and mattrass was<lb/>
sponged over with trichloride.<lb/>
The soldiers bedding &amp; equipment<lb/>
were left in the barrack room<lb/>
of course, to be turned into the<lb/>
company store-room, after<lb/>
the man's death!</p>
<p>At the time of my inspection,<lb/>
after a careful consideration,<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02064005"/>
C1<lb/>
B4<lb/>
I concluded that the disease<lb/>
had been acquired in Pinar<lb/>
del Rio, the city being very<lb/>
close to the Barracks, and<lb/>
that probably both the Quartel,<lb/>
in which the Infantry were quar-<lb/>
tered, and the Post Hospital<lb/>
were infected- Nothing re-<lb/>
mained but to get the garrison<lb/>
out as soon as possible.<lb/>
This was accomplished the<lb/>
following morning (Sunday)<lb/>
the troops going into Camp<lb/>
about 3 miles from the City-<lb/>
I feel confident that by<lb/>
strict quarantine, another<lb/>
week will end the trouble.<lb/>
I do not know how to char-<lb/>
acterize Dr Godfrey's con-<lb/>
duct in the presence of his<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02064006"/>
repeated fatalities- His lack<lb/>
of diagnostic acumen sur-<lb/>
passes all understanding.<lb/>
I am of the opinion that<lb/>
he should never again be<lb/>
placed in any position<lb/>
of responsibility- To again<lb/>
place the lives of officers<lb/>
and enlisted men in his<lb/>
keeping, at least on this<lb/>
Island, would be well<lb/>
nigh criminal!</p>
<p>Our laboratories are now<lb/>
in good working order-<lb/>
We have<del>ing</del> been able to<lb/>
carefully study 7 cases since<lb/>
our arrival -- of these one<lb/>
recovered (a severe case) and<lb/>
six died -- neither during<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02064007"/>
life nor after death, have we<lb/>
been able to isolate b. icteroides,<lb/>
although our 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> autopsy, which<lb/>
occurred day before yesterday,<lb/>
can not be definitely repor-<lb/>
ted upon as yet-</p>
<p>Drs Durham and Meyers<lb/>
arrived about a week<lb/>
ago &amp; promptly called on us,<lb/>
I placed both of the labora-<lb/>
tories at their service, during<lb/>
their stay <add>in Havana</add>, and we have done<lb/>
everything to make their visit<lb/>
a profitable one, by showing<lb/>
them cases &amp; c- They sail<lb/>
for New York on saturday<lb/>
next- I shall return<lb/>
by transport leaving here<lb/>
about August 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> -- in order<lb/>
to finish my other work.<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02064008"/>
There is plenty of material<lb/>
in Havana, with every prob-<lb/>
ability <add>for</add> <del>of</del> its rapid increase-<lb/>
our last case here died on<lb/>
Monday -- we will therefore ex-<lb/>
pect to transfer our field<lb/>
of work to Military Hospital<lb/>
No. 1- Lazaer, Carroll and<lb/>
Agramonte are all deeply<lb/>
interested in the problem,<lb/>
Personally, I feel that only<lb/>
can <del><unclear></unclear></del> experimentation<lb/>
on human beings serve to<lb/>
clear the field for further<lb/>
effective work -- with one or<lb/>
two points cleared up, we<lb/>
could then work to so much<lb/>
better advantage.</p>
<p>With kindest regards,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Walter Reed</signed>.
