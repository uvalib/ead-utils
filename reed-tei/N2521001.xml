<p>Sept 8 1901</p>
<p>TOPICS OF THE TIMES.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>----Dr. CHARLES FINLAY of Havana evi-<lb/>
dently feels that he is not getting quite as<lb/>
much credit as he deserves for having defi-<lb/>
nitely and publicly declared many years<lb/>
ago that the relation between yellow fever<lb/>
and mosquitos was about what it has re-<lb/>
cently been proved to be by the brilliantly<lb/>
successful experiments of the Government<lb/>
board. In a letter to The Medical Record<lb/>
he not only denies that such facts as he<lb/>
was able unaided to learn made against<lb/>
the acceptance of his theory, as one mem-<lb/>
ber of the board has stated, but he says,<lb/>
in effect, that if the official investigators<lb/>
had availed themselves of the results of<lb/>
his researches and deductions they would<lb/>
have avoided the fatalities which followed<lb/>
some of their recent inoculations. It has<lb/>
long been Dr. FINLAY'S opinion that the<lb/>
severity of the infection conveyed by the<lb/>
mosquito's bite was proportioned to the<lb/>
length of time during which the insect<lb/>
had harbored the germs of the disease, and<lb/>
also that bites comparatively safe in Win-<lb/>
ter were positively dangerous in Summer.<lb/>
&ldquo;Two unexpectedly severe cases,&rdquo; writes<lb/>
Dr. FINLAY, in conclusion, &ldquo;which ended<lb/>
fatally with black vomit, have thus oc-<lb/>
curred at the experimental station, and<lb/>
furnish a warning not to place too much<lb/>
reliance upon previous results obtained in<lb/>
a different season, and evidently justify<lb/>
my former reluctance to experiment, on<lb/>
my sole responsibility, with mosquitos<lb/>
whose contamination had been allowed to<lb/>
reach its fullest development. There are<lb/>
yet many important points to be accurate-<lb/>
ly determined before any one of us can<lb/>
consider himself in a position to discredit<lb/>
the other's work.&rdquo; Here, evidently, is ma-<lb/>
terial for a controversy of no small bitter-<lb/>
ness, for in effect Dr. FINLAY charges that<lb/>
fatal terminations were to be apprehended,<lb/>
if not to be expected, in circumstances like<lb/>
those of the recent inoculations, and that<lb/>
places a large responsibility on the doctors<lb/>
who conducted the experiments.</p>

<p>Dr. Finlay is referring here<lb/>
not to the experiments of the<lb/>
Reed Board but to those<lb/>
of the Gorgas-Guiteras<lb/>
series which came later<lb/>
after the Camp Lazear<lb/>
series had been closed<lb/>
and its conclusions drawn.<lb/>
The G-G series, as has been Said,<lb/>
only demonstrated that y. f. is<lb/>
a very dangerous disease-</p>
