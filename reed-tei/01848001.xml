<salute>Dear People.</salute>
</opener>
<p>I got both of your letters in the same mail<lb/>
and was very glad to hear from home, they came<lb/>
the same day that the dear Paymaster did and<lb/>
it is a very close shave which was the most<lb/>
acceptable, Father spoke of the disagreeable part<lb/>
of camp life, well I should say that we are getting<lb/>
a little touch of the rough side of it, on account<lb/>
of the cold, as the thermometer stands about 50&deg; in<lb/>
the day and goes down as low as 10&deg; at night<lb/>
as for myself I am very comfortably fixed, I<lb/>
will give you a little descreption of the inside<lb/>
of my tent. On the right hand side I have<lb/>
a bed, made by my own hands filled with<lb/>
straw which I sleep on with 3 blankets.<lb/>
1 shelter tent, 1 poncho, 1 pr. pants. 1 coat, and<lb/>
one over coat over me at nights and at that<lb/>
the water freezes in the buckets in the center<lb/>
at the back end in my box with all my clothes<lb/>
and on the left hand side is all the battery<lb/>
ammunition, which takes up the entire side<lb/>
on the top of these is my toilet outfit &amp; my mess<lb/>
stuff. I brought my lamp with me and it <unclear>comes</unclear><lb/>
in beautifully, and the little oil stove which I<lb/>
got in Savanah is the one thing I admire.<lb/>
I tell you I burn oil in high style, 1 gallon per<lb/>
each 36 hours. at the rate of <unclear>15&cent;</unclear> per gallon<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01848002"/>
and I suppose you know as well as I do what<lb/>
an addition it is to ones tent. It has been raining<lb/>
ever since yesterday noon, and it is now 7 P.M.<lb/>
Sunday I took dinner at Miss Sullivans and<lb/>
enjoyed myself ever so much and I took<lb/>
in the Ladies German Tuesday night in full<lb/>
dress. There was no getting out of it as Mr &amp; Mrs<lb/>
Sullivan insisted until I could no longer<lb/>
refuse. I have been to town 3 times since I<lb/>
have been here and we have been here 2 weeks<lb/>
tomorrow, I have a very mean cold but I<lb/>
suppose I am like the rest of the mob.</p>
<p>I spend all my money on tobacco, oil, butter<lb/>
&amp; bread &amp; it takes every cent to run the ranch<lb/>
I have quite a nice little spread except at<lb/>
breakfast and then I simply freeze to death-<lb/>
We get up at 7 AM and drill all day so much so<lb/>
that Ive only seen Bob McMillane a few times<lb/>
since we have been here-</p>
<p>As I must clean up for inspection tomorrow<lb/>
I will close, Dont worry about the Lieut to<lb/>
be, as he is O.K. and happy</p>
<p><unclear>Jill Mable</unclear> I would love to hear from her<lb/>
with dearest love for you all and<lb/>
with a bright view to my commission</p>
<p>I close Your <unclear>aff</unclear></p>
