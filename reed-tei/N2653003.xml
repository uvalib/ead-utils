<p>THE LATE<lb/>
MAJOR WALTER REED.</p>
<p>To the Editor of The New York Times:</p>
<p>On Nov. 23 there died in Washington a<lb/>
man whose heroic work for the welfare of<lb/>
humanity deserves more than passing ap-<lb/>
probation from the citizens of this country.</p>
<p>One among the many reasons given for<lb/>
our interference with Spanish rule in Cuba<lb/>
was our desire to eliminate through modern<lb/>
sanitary measures the perpetual menace to<lb/>
our Southern States by yellow fever. How<lb/>
well this has been accomplished is now one<lb/>
of our most creditable records.</p>
<p>Soon after our occupancy of the Island of<lb/>
Cuba there was appointed by the Govern-<lb/>
ment a board for the investigation of yel-<lb/>
low fever. The presiding officer of that<lb/>
board was Major Walter Reed of the<lb/>
United States Army, whose recent death is<lb/>
so deeply mourned by all who know him<lb/>
and his works.</p>
<p>The details of the work of Reed and his<lb/>
associates in Cuba need not detain us at<lb/>
this time. They are all now matters of his-<lb/>
tory. It suffices to say that, as a result of<lb/>
those labors, in which Reed was the direct-<lb/>
ing mind, yellow fever, the dread pestilence<lb/>
of the South, has been robbed of its mys-<lb/>
teries and terrors; the alarming annual<lb/>
mortality from it has been reduced to prac-<lb/>
tically nothing during the past two sea-<lb/>
sons of its usual greatest epidemicity, the<lb/>
annual expenditure of millions of money for<lb/>
quarantine and its accessories shown to be<lb/>
in large part if not wholly needless, and<lb/>
the disquieting apprehension that existed<lb/>
annually throughout our Southern States<lb/>
from the beginning to the end of the yel-<lb/>
low fever season put once and for all at<lb/>
rest.</p>
<p>Had we been told so short a time as three<lb/>
years ago that through the agency of man<lb/>
a Summer might be passed in Havana<lb/>
without the customary epidemic occurrence<lb/>
of yellow fever the statement would have<lb/>
been received with justifiable skepticism.<lb/>
Yet all this has come about, as the records<lb/>
for the Summers of 1901 and 1902 show.</p>
<p>Had we been told that the elaborate and<lb/>
expensive system of maritime quarantine<lb/>
against yellow fever, the commerce <unclear>de-</unclear><lb/>
stroying and annoying practices of railroad<lb/>
and shotgun quarantine were needless and<lb/>
powerless since they were projected in the<lb/>
wrong direction, we would have hesitated<lb/>
for some time before believing. Yet this,<lb/>
too, we now know to be true, all through<lb/>
the services of the small company of men,<lb/>
with Reed at their head, who, regardless of<lb/>
the menaces to health and life, took up<lb/>
their abode in the very hotbed of the dis-<lb/>
ease and remained there (save those who<lb/>
died in the cause) until they had definitely<lb/>
solved a problem that had baffled all pre-<lb/>
vious investigators.</p>
<p>Were the discoveries concerning the prop-<lb/>
agation and spread of yellow fever, with<lb/>
their outcome, the suppression of yellow<lb/>
fever in Havana, the single advantage from<lb/>
our war with Spain, they would have been<lb/>
cheaply purchased had their price been the<lb/>
entire cost of that war.</p>
<p>In view of the magnitude of the services<lb/>
rendered by Major Reed to his country and<lb/>
to humanity, it is a source of regret to all<lb/>
good citizens that Major Reed did not leave<lb/>
any property, and that his heirs are at the<lb/>
moment by law entitled to a pension of<lb/>
just $25 per month, neither more nor less.</p>
<p>As one who enjoyed an intimate personal<lb/>
acquaintance with Major Reed, who was<lb/>
familiar with his high-minded ideals and<lb/>
ambitions for the advancement of knowl-<lb/>
edge, for the good of mankind<unclear>.</unclear> I am justi-<lb/>
fied in saying that the question of mate-<lb/>
rial reward for his work occupied but a<lb/>
small part of his attention. But that is<lb/>
not the point. The services rendered de-<lb/>
mand of those who enjoy their advantages<lb/>
a fitting and lasting testimonial, and no<lb/>
more acceptable legislation by Congress<lb/>
could at this time be considered than that<lb/>
aiming to appropriately recognize the mag-<lb/>
nificent work done by one of the country's<lb/>
most loyal, capable, and distinguished citi-<lb/>
zens.</p>
