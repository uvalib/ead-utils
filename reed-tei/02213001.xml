<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Although it<lb/>
is nearly 11 o'clock, I can't go<lb/>
to bed until I have written,<lb/>
if only a line, to my sweet oom-<lb/>
sey with the Gout in her darl-<lb/>
ing foot and &ldquo;toseys&rdquo;. Mr Mantee,<lb/>
in the midst of his work, has<lb/>
thought of you so many times<lb/>
today and wondered whether<lb/>
his sweet wifie was suffer-<lb/>
ing any pain or not, and whether,<lb/>
while darling joy had gone<lb/>
to school, there was anybody<lb/>
to rub her leg and so take<lb/>
the pain away. I am so<lb/>
anxious for Saturday to come<lb/>
so that I can hear that you<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02213002"/>
are so much better and able<lb/>
to get along on your<del>s</del> feet once<lb/>
more. Dear Me! those cakes of<lb/>
old Mrs. Greer's were too rich<lb/>
for your blood entirely! Does-<lb/>
n't Dr Nash allow you any<lb/>
of those horrid &ldquo;cock-tails&rdquo;, that<lb/>
you used to try to give me?<lb/>
I guess that &ldquo;cocktails&rdquo; with &ldquo;cake<lb/>
and <unclear>sich</unclear>&rdquo; have done the &ldquo;gouty<lb/>
business&rdquo;- or didn't you man-<lb/>
age to give your foot or leg<lb/>
a <hi>twist</hi> of some kind, that you<lb/>
have forgotten? Tell me all<lb/>
about it when you next<lb/>
write.</p>
<p><hi>Friday</hi> - <hi>Novr 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi></hi>. I couldn't write<lb/>
any more, last night, but<lb/>
must jot down a few words<lb/>
this afternoon- I hope<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02213003"/>
that my sweet oomsey is<lb/>
much better, to-day, or entire<lb/>
ly recovered from her gouty<lb/>
affliction. The days pass very<lb/>
rapidly here, but there is<lb/>
very little that I can do-<lb/>
my experimental station is<lb/>
complete except one of the<lb/>
buildings. I have five amer-<lb/>
ican non-immunes, three of<lb/>
whom are ready to try any<lb/>
kind of experiment I shall<lb/>
propose, while the other two<lb/>
will try the infected bed-<lb/>
ding test- I have, also, 6<lb/>
spanish immigrants, recently<lb/>
arrived who are working<lb/>
as laborer's around the<lb/>
camp - whether when we<lb/>
make the offer to them, they<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02213004"/>
will be willing to accept<lb/>
and give their written con-<lb/>
sent, I don't know- Already<lb/>
some anonymous correspon-<lb/>
dent has been writing to<lb/>
one of the Spanish papers in<lb/>
Havana, telling about what<lb/>
we propose to do, and this paper,<lb/>
&ldquo;La Discussion&rdquo;, is calling upon<lb/>
the authorities to stop the &ldquo;<hi>hor-<lb/>
ror</hi>&rdquo;, as it designates our ex-<lb/>
periments- We have thought<lb/>
it best to have the Spanish<lb/>
consul interviewed, there-<lb/>
fore, and he very properly<lb/>
takes a sensible view of the<lb/>
matter, &amp; sees no reason<lb/>
why the observations should<lb/>
not be made on any one<lb/>
who gives his full written<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02213005"/>
consent, after the danger<lb/>
has been explained to him.<lb/>
So that as far as Spain's rep-<lb/>
resentative is concerned,<lb/>
we need give ourselves<lb/>
no bother. Of course, the<lb/>
newspapers here are just<lb/>
like those in the U.S- any-<lb/>
thing, however false, so that<lb/>
a sensation is produced<lb/>
and the paper sold.<lb/>
The Havana Post, the only<lb/>
English paper in town, has<lb/>
made no comments so<lb/>
far and I have no reason<lb/>
to think that it will-<lb/>
However, I shall pay no<lb/>
attention to any of them<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02213006"/>
<hi>Friday night</hi>. I have just returned<lb/>
from making my party call on <add>Dr</add><lb/>
&amp; Mrs. Stark, and found them sitting<lb/>
in their little quarters and looking<lb/>
very happy and contented. Mrs.<lb/>
Stark is a very charming<lb/>
girl and makes life lots brighter<lb/>
at this end of the garrison than<lb/>
it would otherwise be- I<lb/>
took a glass of sherry and a<lb/>
bite of cake with them-<lb/>
Perhaps my sweet wifie<lb/>
will be afraid that <hi>I</hi> <add>too</add> will<lb/>
get the <hi>gout</hi>, if I don't stop<lb/>
taking so much punch, cham-<lb/>
pagne and sherry; but there<lb/>
is really very little danger<lb/>
for I indulge very lightly in<lb/>
these things. I hope that<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02213007"/>
Dr Nash has made you throw<lb/>
away those horrid cock-tails,<lb/>
or had my sweet oomsey<del>s</del> drunk<lb/>
them all before her attack<lb/>
of misery in the foot!</p>
<p>This afternoon, I went with<lb/>
Dr Agramonte to the experimen-<lb/>
tal station and had him talk<lb/>
with the Spaniards about our<lb/>
experimental proposition.<lb/>
To my surprise, they were all<lb/>
quite willing to undergo<lb/>
any form of experiment. They<lb/>
said that they had never had<lb/>
so much to eat or been treated<lb/>
so kindly in all their lives, and<lb/>
that they expected to get yel-<lb/>
low fever anyway, when they<lb/>
went to Havana. So that we<lb/>
will not lack for material<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02213008"/>
on which to make our obser-<lb/>
vations- If it were only August<lb/>
23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> instead of <hi>Novr 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi></hi>, we could<lb/>
soon be able to arrive at some<lb/>
very interesting results. As it<lb/>
is, I can't help thinking that the<lb/>
parasite will develop much more<lb/>
slowly, during this weather, in the<lb/>
bodies of the mosquitoes, and that<lb/>
we must keep the latter alive<lb/>
at least 18-20 days, if we would<lb/>
get any results- Time will tell<lb/>
however, and I feel greatly encour-<lb/>
aged. <hi>Saturday Morning 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>. Good<lb/>
morning, my sweet wifie, dear! Did you<lb/>
sleep well last night? And had no<lb/>
pain? I sincerely hope so. I didn't retire<lb/>
till after eleven, &amp; hence I am still sleepy,<lb/>
but I had to jump up and close this<lb/>
patchwork of a little letter to my precious<lb/>
oomsey, &ldquo;wid de Gout&rdquo;! Boo! Boo! no<lb/>
toddies, no mother Greer's cakes, but <hi>lots</hi> of<lb/>
<hi>mineral water</hi>! Love &amp; kisses for my dear girls.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Devotedly,</salute>
<signed>Papa</signed>.
