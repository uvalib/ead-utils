Brig. General Albert Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco, California<lb/>
<salute>Dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just heard from a friend back East that you<lb/>
now reside in California, so being close by in Berkeley, thought I would<lb/>
write to you.</p>
<p>It is quite unlikely that you will remember me out of<lb/>
the thousands of Hospital Corpsmen you have been in contact with during<lb/>
your long service in the Medical Department of the Army, but as I served<lb/>
under you during your first command, at Columbia Barracks, Cuba, and<lb/>
remember you quite well and favorably, I am going to write to you anyway.</p>
<p>I was at Pinar del Rio during the Yellow Fever<lb/>
(diagnosed Pernicious Malaria) episode there, and later came to Columbia<lb/>
Barracks and served there from beginning to end of the experiments of<lb/>
Major Reed's Board. So I served under you and Captain Stark.</p>
<p>I was a clerk at Pinar del Rio and held the same<lb/>
job at Columbia Barracks Hospital, keeping the S. &amp; W. Reports,<lb/>
Pay Rolls, etc. I was studying for Asst. Hospl. Steward at the time<lb/>
and passed with a very high percentage, but was rejected because the<lb/>
examining board, (Contract Doctors) found I had slight mitral insufficiency.</p>
<p>Captain Stark told me that no Regular Army Board would<lb/>
have ever considered that sufficient reason for rejection, and if so,<lb/>
would not have allowed me to take the rest of the examination, which this<lb/>
Board did.</p>
<p>I am one of the men in the picture in which you appear,<lb/>
taken on the hospital steps at Columbia Barracks. I was sent to Fort<lb/>
Bayard, N. M. from Quemados and reenlisted there. There I came down with<lb/>
a bad case of Bacillary Dysentary, brought in my system from Cuba. Major<lb/>
Appel, Hospital Commander, said it was the worst case he ever saw that<lb/>
survived. I was his pet show-off to other doctors for quite awhile.</p>
<p>I took all dictation from doctors at monthly examination<lb/>
of tubercular patients and made out all the charts. Later was personal<lb/>
clerk to Major Appel.</p>
<p>I have read all the books written about the Yellow<lb/>
Fever experiments, and your book, I am happy to say, is the only real,<lb/>
factual account of that great event. Most of the others were written<lb/>
by people who were not there.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06501063"/>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>I was in a position there to learn a great deal about<lb/>
things, and knew everyone connected with the experiment, and in my<lb/>
opinion no one has written so truthfully and comprehensively of this<lb/>
event as yourself.</p>
<p>I read the book at the Public Library here. You<lb/>
know, I'd give anything to have a copy of that book for myself as<lb/>
a momento of that great time. Honestly, I hate to write this, but<lb/>
I wonder, I wonder, if you have a copy of it you could spare?<lb/>
You can realize what it would mean to me to have a copy signed by<lb/>
yourself. It would surely be a treasured possesion.</p>
<p>I congratulate you on your achievements in the<lb/>
Army and your deserved promitions to the highest rank, and it<lb/>
makes me feel like old times to know that my old C. O. is in the<lb/>
same great State of California with me.</p>
<closer>
<salute>With very best wishes,<lb/>
Cordially &amp; Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>&sol;s&sol; Paul L. Tate</signed>
