<salute>My dear Dr Hench-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have intended writing you<lb/>
for some time, to <unclear>acquaint</unclear> you <unclear>with</unclear> Blossom's<lb/>
illness, but for some <add><del><unclear></unclear></del></add> accountable reason I<lb/>
failed to do so.</p>
<p>Blossom began to show symptoms<lb/>
of her old trouble shortly after Mother's death.<lb/>
At first Dr <unclear>Bredgers</unclear> hoped he could pull her<lb/>
through up at The Summit, <unclear>but</unclear> he finally<lb/>
decided it would be far better to have her<lb/>
come to the W. R <unclear>Hosp<hi rend="superscript">l</hi></unclear></p>
<p>Three weeks ago today I went up<lb/>
to the Summit to see Blossom to <unclear>invite</unclear> her<lb/>
down to visit me for a while, Dr. <unclear>Bredgers</unclear><lb/>
thought that a change might turn the trick,<lb/>
but she simply would not come, said she had<lb/>
too much to do to leave at that time-</p>
<p>I could tell she was not herself<lb/>
but could not get her to tell me what her<lb/>
troubles were although I strongly suspected<lb/>
that it was financial worries-</p>
<pb n="2" id="f04343002"/>
<p>AC</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>I had previously explained to her, that<lb/>
now that her income was drastically cut,<lb/>
she could overcome the difficulty by renting<lb/>
her cottage and spending the winter with<lb/>
me. This she <unclear>fiercely</unclear> declined to do-</p>
<p>The next Wednesday (2 1/2 weeks ago)<lb/>
Dr. <unclear>Bredgers</unclear> called me by phone and said<lb/>
I better get the W R Hosp<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>to send an<lb/>
ambulance, The W. R. H. sent a Dr and a<lb/>
nurse along and she came down quite<lb/>
willingly and she is now in the N. P. <unclear>Section</unclear></p>
<p>Her Doctors seem to think she<lb/>
is progressing satisfactorily-</p>
<p>This is Blossom's fifth (5)<lb/>
attack in the last 9- years- In 41<lb/>
she was in the W R <unclear>Hosp<hi rend="superscript">l</hi></unclear> Ward 4 (open<lb/>
ward) about 3 mo. In <del><unclear></unclear></del> 42 she was<lb/>
in the N P. Sect of the W R <unclear>Hosp<hi rend="superscript">e</hi></unclear> and St<lb/>
<unclear>Elizabeth-</unclear> from Oct to Feb 1. Since then<lb/>
she has had two minor attacks both of<lb/>
which she recovered from without being<lb/>
hospitalized<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f04343003"/>
MAJOR GENERAL WALTER L. REED<lb/>
2810 THIRTY SIX PLACE<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
This present attack appears to be less<lb/>
severe than the two other occassions when<lb/>
she had to be hospitalized-</p>
<p>Her second attack and this one<lb/>
appear to be due to financial difficulties-<lb/>
It has always been hard for her to face<lb/>
financial difficulties she prefers to take<lb/>
the line of least <unclear>resistance</unclear>, believing &ldquo;The<lb/>
Lord will provide&rdquo;</p>
<p>While her present financial <del><unclear>difficulty</unclear></del><lb/>
problem is a little difficult it is by no means<lb/>
hopeless- unless she simply refuses to see<lb/>
that her <unclear>income</unclear> has been cut to the point<lb/>
where she must change her mode of living-</p>
<p>Of course she is terribly sentimental<lb/>
and has a peculiar false idea that she is enlisted<lb/>
to <unclear>this role</unclear> I have tried to dissuade her of<lb/>
many of her ideas &amp; dreams but to no appreciable<lb/>
effect- Therefore the time has come when her<lb/>
Drs &amp; I must lay the law down to her so><lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f04343004"/>
Ac<lb/>
R<lb/>
firmly that she will (I hope) have to<lb/>
realize <unclear>whats what</unclear> and I live accordingly</p>
<p>So long as I am alive she<lb/>
should <unclear>not</unclear> have to worry but in her<lb/>
present instability Im not so <del><unclear>she</unclear></del> sure<lb/>
how she <unclear>will</unclear> take it-</p>
<p>She has in the <unclear>past</unclear> spoken of<lb/>
selling this, that and the other- I have told<lb/>
her she has nothing that has any real<lb/>
value (other than her house) I'm afraid<lb/>
she will bother you &amp; Col Siler with<lb/>
her ideas, thats why I have written<lb/>
in such detail, so you will better<lb/>
understand and not take her too seriously</p>
<p>I will keep you informed, from<lb/>
time to time how she is doing</p>
<p>Please pardon this lengthy letter-</p>
<p>Kindest regards to you both</p>

<salute>Most Sincerely-</salute>
