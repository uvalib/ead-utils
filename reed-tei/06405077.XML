<salute>Dear Colonel Hench:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was pleased to get your<lb/>
letter of Dec. 31. It contained so much<lb/>
info. of interest to me, as well as<lb/>
the news about your activities. It must<lb/>
seem good to get back to your old<lb/>
home and to your work at the clinic.<lb/>
However, no matter how much you have<lb/>
been put out by your army experience,<lb/>
you will eventually look back on it<lb/>
with pleasure and feel, too, that it<lb/>
was worth while. I do hope you will<lb/>
eventually clear up some of the real<lb/>
problems of your specialty, and that your<lb/>
work in the army has aided in solving<lb/>
them.</p>
<p>I was glad to hear of the Keans, Irelands,<lb/>
Reeds and others. Wish I could have<lb/>
been at the Hotel Staller dinner too.<lb/>
Of course, I was much interested in<lb/>
what you said about your paranoid friend--<lb/>
Carroll. I am confident that he has the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06405078"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
Lazear note book &amp; other papers that<lb/>
should have been left by his father in<lb/>
his lab. at the Army Med. School. That is where<lb/>
Reed left them. Years ago, either Ireland or<lb/>
Kean, told m<unclear>e</unclear> that &ldquo;The Lazear note book<lb/>
mysteriously disappeared <del>after</del><add>at</add> Carroll's death&rdquo;<lb/>
I hope you will be able to get someone;<lb/>
like Mr. C.L. Reed, who can succede in<lb/>
getting things from Carroll. The notebook<lb/>
in probably the only thing of value, but any<lb/>
of Reed's letters would contain important<lb/>
data. I do hope to see that <hi>note book</hi> and<lb/>
see how near right I have been in<lb/>
my statements. So keep after it.</p>
<p>Now, I want to bother you about a little<lb/>
professional information. In the Feb. '46<lb/>
issue of the Reeder's Digest, Paul de Kruif<lb/>
has an article about the <hi>wonderful</hi><lb/>
results of <hi>prostigmin</hi> in relieving the<lb/>
spasticity in various forms of spastic<lb/>
paralysis and even in some forms of<lb/>
arthritis. As the spacticity which I still<lb/>
have is <del>my</del><add>the</add> only thing that bothers me, I<lb/>
would like to know what you people think<lb/>
of it. I have never seen the things which<lb/>
de Kruif has written about live up to his<lb/>
landatory reports, so I have more or less<lb/>
discredited him. How the profession feels about<lb/>
him I dont know. If there is anything in<lb/>
his claims about prostigmin I would like<lb/>
to give it a trial, unless there are contraindicati<unclear>ons</unclear><lb/>
to its use. de Kruif never mentions things<lb/>
which interfere with the use of the drugs<lb/>

San Francisco, California<lb/>
he lauds <del>to the <unclear>skies</unclear></del> so highly.</p>
<p>I asked Hillman, at the Letterman,<lb/>
about it and he did not know-<lb/>
further, he has no one who is up<lb/>
on such things. The Letterman is now<lb/>
almost entirely a surgical outfit.</p>
<p>I am in fine shape and really feel<lb/>
fine. I still have trouble with my leg<lb/>
and relief from the spasticity would<lb/>
practically relieve me of all trouble<lb/>
I dont think that any of my brain cells were destroyed<lb/>
Any information you can give me<lb/>
on the subject would therefore be<lb/>
much appreciated.</p>
<p>From what I can learn the A.M.A.<lb/>
will meet here in S.F. in July (1-5)<lb/>
So it is nice to know that you<lb/>
are scheduled to be present. It will<lb/>
be fine to see you out here again.<lb/>
Plan to stay an extra day to talk<lb/>
with me about Y.F. There are still<lb/>
plenty of things to mull over.</p>
<p>My son Jack is in Tokyo. He graduated<lb/>
from West Point last June. He is one<lb/>
of the officers on Mac A's staff on Counter<lb/>
Intelligence work. He enjoys it<lb/>

my oldest daughter is now living<lb/>

her home again.</p>

your charming family</p>
