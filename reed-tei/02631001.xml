Washington DC. Sept. 9, 1902.</p>
<p>Respectfully forwarded to the Sur-<lb/>
geon General, U. S. A. This applicati-<lb/>
on meets with my most earnest ap-<lb/>
proval. Dr. James Carroll, Contract<lb/>
Surgeon U. S. A., has been closely asso-<lb/>
ciated with me in daily professio-<lb/>
nal work since October, 1893, during<lb/>
which time he has served in the<lb/>
capacity of Assistant Instructor in<lb/>
the Army Medical School, as assis-<lb/>
tant in laboratory work and as my<lb/>
colleague on the Yellow Fever Board<lb/>
appointed by Par. 34, S.O.N: 122, A.G.<lb/>
O., May 24, 1900. In each of these capa-<lb/>
cities he has not only discharged his<lb/>
obligations to the U. S. Government in<lb/>
a most faithful and intelligent man-<lb/>
ner, but has also demonstrated courage<lb/>
of a high order in submitting himself<lb/>
to inoculation for the purpose of<lb/>
proving the mosquito - theory of yellow<lb/>
fever. I know of no physician who de-<lb/>
serves more credit than Dr. Carroll for<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
his intelligent perseverance in<lb/>
rising from the grade of an enlis-<lb/>
ted soldier through that of non-<lb/>
commissioned officer to the <unclear>rank</unclear><lb/>
of Contract Surgeon U. S. A., in all<lb/>
of which grades his record has been<lb/>
continually excellent. He has, by<lb/>
constant application to his studies<lb/>
and duties, won the hearty esteem<lb/>
both of his senior medical officers<lb/>
of the Faculty of the Army Medical<lb/>
School as well as that of the best phy-<lb/>
sicians in the city of Washington,<lb/>
and I am pleased to add that his<lb/>
desire to enter the service as a<lb/>
commissioned medical officer meets<lb/>
with the hearty approval of all the<lb/>
members of the Faculty of the Army<lb/>
Medical School. I, therefore, earn-<lb/>
estly recommend that Dr. Carrolls<lb/>
application may receive favor-<lb/>
able action</p>
<p>Walter Reed,<lb/>
Major, Surgeon U. S. A.</p>

<lb/>
<lb/>
<p>2d Indorsement<lb/>
WAR DEPARTMENT,<lb/>
SURGEON GENERAL'S OFFICE.<lb/>
September 11, 1902.</p>
<p>Respectfully forwarded to<lb/>
the ADJUTANT GENERAL OF THE<lb/>
ARMY, with request that these<lb/>
papers be submitted to the Hon.<lb/>
the Secretary of War.</p>
<p>This is an application from<lb/>
Dr. James Carroll, Contract Sur-<lb/>
geon, U. S. Army, for an invita-<lb/>
tion to appear before the Army<lb/>
Medical Board now in session<lb/>
for examination with a view to<lb/>
appointment as Assistant Surgeon<lb/>
in the Army should he be found<lb/>
qualified.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll's long service<lb/>
has been so useful and brilliant<lb/>
that his request would be grant-<lb/>
as a matter of course but for<lb/>
the fact that he is 48 years old<lb/>
and so is barred out by the<lb/>
present regulation on the sub-<lb/>
ject. This regulation can how-<lb/>
ever be waived by the Hon. the<lb/>
Secretary of War, and consider-<lb/>
ing that Dr. Carroll has already<lb/>
spent twenty-four years of his<lb/>
life in the military service as<lb/>
an enlisted man and later as a<lb/>
contract surgeon, I believe the<lb/>
regulation should be waived so<lb/>
far as it applies to him.</p>
<p>Attention is invited to<lb/>
the enclosed commendations and<lb/>
to the endorsements hereon.</p>
<p>I recommend that Dr. Car-<lb/>
roll be authorized to appear<lb/>
for examination, and should he<lb/>
be found qualified in other</p>
