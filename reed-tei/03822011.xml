<unclear>librarian</unclear> Finlay Institute<lb/>
<date value="1941-06-29">6/29/41</date>
My dear Dr. Albertini</p>
<p>I hope that you are receiving the Proceedings of the Staff<lb/>
meetings of the Mayo Clinic which I asked to have sent to you.<lb/>
I have been continuing my search for unpublished data<lb/>
regarding the conquest of yellow fever. I spent some time<lb/>
in Washington where, <del><unclear></unclear></del> through the help of General<lb/>
J. R Kean and former Surgeon General Ireland I<lb/>
unearthed the <del>written</del> hand-written records of the<lb/>
Columbia Barracks Post Hospital, also <del>many</del><add>much</add> of the<lb/>
correspondence between Surgeon General Sternberg and<lb/>
the U. S. army yellow fever commission in Havana.</p>
<p><del>By the way</del></p>
<p>on June 2, 1941 the Wyeth Company, a large old <del><unclear>the</unclear></del><lb/>
reputable <add>American</add> pharmaceutical house, unveiled a very<lb/>
interesting painting depicting the &ldquo;Conquerors of Yellow<lb/>
Fever&rdquo;. You will be pleased to know that Dr. Finlay has<lb/>
been rightly given a very prominent place in the painting.<lb/>
I was present at the unveiling which was done by<lb/>
Walter Reed's daughter. Kissinger was present also.<lb/>
Two days later he had a severe stroke and was<lb/>
completely paralyzed on his right side; his vision and speech<lb/>
are also affected. I do hope he escapes long<lb/>
suffering. I have just heard that Miss Blossom<lb/>
Reed, who unveiled the painting, has just suffered<lb/>
a severe heart attack. Both of these constitute a<lb/>
tragic aftermath to an inspiring ceremony.</p>
<p>When I was in Havana Miss Agramonte<lb/>
(Sr. Rodriguez - Leon) loaned me the enclosed photograph<lb/>
in which her father &amp; Drs. Guiteras &amp; Finlay appear. She<lb/>
asked if I could find out who some of the other<lb/>
men were. The photograph was labelled &ldquo;Commission<lb/>
of Infectious Diseases - Mariel 1901, Pinar del Rio&rdquo;<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03822014"/>
and was in her fathers collection. Gen. Kean could not<lb/>
recognize the others. May I ask if you would kindly<lb/>
study the photograph &amp; return it to me. Perhaps you<lb/>
can recognize some of those present.</p>
<p>(over)</p>
<p>I am continuing my attempts to try to raise<lb/>
enough money to memorialize properly the site of<lb/>
Camp Lazear &amp; the little Building number one which<lb/>
we discovered. I do hope the impending war<lb/>
won't stop my efforts.</p>
<p>&para;</p>
<p>I have hunted everywhere for a history (<del><unclear></unclear></del> of Military Hospital<lb/>
number one but could find <unclear>nothing</unclear> in this, country. Last May when I<lb/>
visited the library at the Finlay Institute with Drs. Ramos and<lb/>
Recio the librarian showed me a copy of a book about the<lb/>
hospital. <del><unclear></unclear></del> I told him I was very anxious to borrow it<lb/>
to have photostatic copies made but would first see if I<lb/>
could find it in this country. I have searched the Congressional<lb/>
Library in Washington, the Surgeon General's Library, <del>and</del> The New York<lb/>
Public Library and others but have been unable to find it.<lb/>
I am writing the librarian at the Finlay Institute<lb/>
asking if he would be willing to send me his book by<lb/>
registered mail so that I could copy it. If you could help<lb/>
me in this matter I would appreciate it very much<lb/>
indeed.</p>
<p>It was so pleasant to meet you again<lb/>
and I should like to be able to entertain you<lb/>
if you <add>could</add> ever visit the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p><del><unclear>Very Sincerely yours</unclear></del><lb/>
Very Sincerely yours</p>
