<p>Excerpt of letter to Mr. Wickliffe Rose from Henry Hanson, Chiclayo, July<lb/>
28, 1921.</p>
<p>At present Dr. Enrique Caballero, Mr. John P. Corrigan, and<lb/>
Inspector Arturo Sainz are working in the northern section of the Department<lb/>
of Ancash, with instructions to work everything of importance from the north<lb/>
towards the south. The object of this is to avoid the possibility of any<lb/>
repetition of what has occured this year. It may not be absolutely necessary,<lb/>
but it is very much safer to do it, and I think Dr. White agrees that it is worth<lb/>
doing. The breeding in this section was reported to be extremely high. The<lb/>
plan there is to limit the work entirely to the use of fish in so far as<lb/>
possible, which will result more economically both in time and money.</p>
<p>For the future we can concentrate more on the larger places, and<lb/>
discontinue what we have been doing in the smaller places up to the time we<lb/>
were certain of the extent of the propagation.</p>
<p>In about another month I think we shall know with reasonable certainty<lb/>
what the final outcome is to be. It is about a month since we have had any re-<lb/>
ported cases from any place in this Department, and the mosquito index is low<lb/>
and decreasing. The entire province of Pacasmayo is completely safe, with an<lb/>
average stegomya index which does not reach one percent. All the balance of the<lb/>
Department of Libertad with the exception of Casa Grande is in satisfactory<lb/>
condition, and the whole thing has brought about somewhat of a relaxation of the<lb/>
intense anxiety under which we were working for four months and a half.</p>
<p>At present all our work is paralyzed for about a week on account of the<lb/>
Centenniel Celebration, and it is useless to try to work under such conditions.<lb/>
Fortunately we have practically everything in such shape that it will not do<lb/>
us much harm.</p>
