Colonel Jefferson R. Kean,<lb/>
The Association of Military Surgeons of the U. S.,<lb/>
7th and B Streets, S. W.,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of February 24th has followed me all<lb/>
around Robinhood's Barn, and in the same mail I received<lb/>
the New York Times containing a very fine address of General<lb/>
Summerall on the military career of General Wood. It quite<lb/>
<del>disturbed</del><add><unclear>stirred</unclear> up</add> my feelings and filled me with pride and pleasure.</p>
<p>In reply to your query about certain statements<lb/>
made by the General in his address, I think both of General<lb/>
Summerall's statements are correct, to this extent as regards<lb/>
the appointment and sending of the Sternberg Board. The<lb/>
initiative probably was with General Sternberg, but I do<lb/>
know that General Wood talked with him about it and urged<lb/>
the importance of such a work on two occasions when he was<lb/>
in Washington while still Governor of Santiago; and I also<lb/>
know, as you do, how thoroughly General Wood supported and<lb/>
encouraged the work of that Board after he became Governor<lb/>
General. I am not sure, however, that you will remember<lb/>
that at one period, without consultation with the Governor<lb/>
General, General Sternberg ordered this Board to complete<lb/>
this work and return to Washington. That Dr. Reed came to<lb/>
General<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06272017"/>
- 2 -<lb/>
General Wood in great distress about it, and as you would<lb/>
imagine General Wood took it up so vigorously with the De-<lb/>
partment and personally with Mr. Root <add><unclear></unclear></add> that General Sternberg<lb/>
relented and the Board finished its greatwork with sufficient<lb/>
time to do it right.</p>
<p>General Wood had a light case of yellow fever either<lb/>
in August or September of 1898 while Military Governor of the<lb/>
city of Santiago. I think it was during the period when<lb/>
General Lawton was Military Governor of the province and<lb/>
General Wood Military Governor of the city. I was not with<lb/>
him at the time, but I do know that he had a written certifi-<lb/>
cate which gave the facts and established his immunity, for<lb/>
in after years, when he was Governor General, I accompanied<lb/>
him to the United States several times when I was obliged to<lb/>
undergo quarantine as a non-immune and he was passed in at<lb/>
once on a certificate of immunity.</p>
<p>I had hoped to spend the next few months in the<lb/>
United States, but conditions here are such that the Secretary<lb/>
of State has asked me to remain on the spot, so that I shall<lb/>
probably not be in Washington until late in the year. Frances<lb/>
and I often talk about you and Mrs. Kean, and she joins me in<lb/>
love and best wishes.</p>
