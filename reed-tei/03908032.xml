Colonel Harold W. Jones<lb/>
Army Medical Library<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Jones:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your letter of January 8 commenting on the suggestion of<lb/>
Mr. Keys of the Mayo Clinic Library that I submit to you a paper for the<lb/>
Bulletin of the Medical Library Association. Instead of answering it, I<lb/>
took it with me to Washington as I was going there a few days later. Un-<lb/>
fortunately, I visited your office when you were away for a day or so with<lb/>
a bad cold, I believe. I saw Dr. Mayer and asked that he tell you of my<lb/>
call. I didn't really know whether you will want what I have to offer or not.</p>
<p>By separate post, I am sending you a reprint of a yellow fever story<lb/>
which I recently wrote. This is in connection with the Wyeth painting on the<lb/>
&ldquo;Conquerors of Yellow Fever&rdquo;. Prior to the decision to paint the final version<lb/>
of the painting as illustrated in my reprint, two Cuban versions of this paint-<lb/>
ing were made. These original paintings now are in our library here. The<lb/>
Wyeth people had colored plates made of them but have not used them. I enclose<lb/>
illustrations of them in the size of prints which are available. Mr. Keys<lb/>
suggested that I make a brief abstract of the paper which I have already pub-<lb/>
lished and illustrate it with one or two of these Cuban versions of the paint-<lb/>
ing. I am given to believe that you may not be especially interested in any<lb/>
abstract of a paper already published even though it is illustrated by un-<lb/>
published plates, but if you are, I shall be glad to cooperate.</p>
<p>Mr. Kellogg, who was responsible for these colored plates says they<lb/>
will be very glad to lend you the plates although they hardly feel justified in<lb/>
printing the colored inserts and giving them to you gratis. Let me make myself<lb/>
clear. They will be glad to lend you the plates gratis if you wish to make use<lb/>
of them. Please feel frank to tell me what you think. In any event, I should<lb/>
appreciate if you would return the colored illustrations to me as they are the<lb/>
only ones I have.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
