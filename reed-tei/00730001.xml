<salute>Dear Henry:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I rec'd your watch yes-<lb/>
terday. I am very much o-<lb/>
bliged to you for the loan<lb/>
of it. It has been beautifully<lb/>
cleaned &amp; looks a bright as<lb/>
new. It brings back old<lb/>
times to me, as it has been<lb/>
with me in many a tough &amp;<lb/>
dou<add>b</add>tful place. It has al-<lb/>
ways been a lucky watch<lb/>
too &amp; I hope it may bring<lb/>
me luck this time. Hope it may<lb/>
help find the other one.</p>
<p>I have advertised for the other<lb/>
one in the papers &amp; have stuck<lb/>
up a spanish notice &ldquo;$40 00/100<lb/>
&amp; no questions asked&rdquo; on my<lb/>
room door- I have been to<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00730002"/>

2<lb/>
the <unclear>secret</unclear> police, who have<lb/>
<hi>my</hi> description &amp; antecedents<lb/>
all recorded, but who do not<lb/>
seem to be specially interes-<lb/>
ted in the thief. I am without<lb/>
hope of finding it, unless the reor-<lb/>
ganization of the secret police<lb/>
should make them look for<lb/>
<hi>it</hi>. For all of which I am very<lb/>
sorry.</p>
<p>I have just finished, save the<lb/>
posting in of footnotes, <del>quite</del><lb/>
a little piece on the y. f. sta-<lb/>
tistics of Havana. I should not<lb/>
have undertaken it with all the<lb/>
other work I have on hand,<lb/>
but I got interested in it &amp;-well-<lb/>
I am glad it is done.</p>
<p>Did you get the geometry prob-<lb/>
lems I sent you? I did not work<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00730003"/>
3<lb/>
3<lb/>
them all, but all that I tried.<lb/>
Where are you in your Geom-<lb/>
etry? My calculation was that<lb/>
by June 15, you would be near-<lb/>
ly through; but I suppose you<lb/>
lost some time on account<lb/>
of having your teeth fixed.<lb/>
If you finish it before schools<lb/>
close it will be enough. By<lb/>
the way, if you can manage<lb/>
it, it would be a good thing<lb/>
if you went down to Ashland<lb/>
to see Sam's commencement.<lb/>
I don't think you will enjoy<lb/>
going: but you would enjoy<lb/>
<hi>having gone</hi> &amp; it would be<lb/>
a good thing to see something of<lb/>
college life.</p>
<p>I wish I were with you all at N. R.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00730004"/>

now - soon it will be too hot<lb/>
for comfort, &amp; yet the best way<lb/>
<del>to s</del> not to mind the heat is<lb/>
to work in it in the beginning<lb/>
of the summer.</p>
<p>I shall always be glad that I<lb/>
was able to spend so much of the<lb/>
winter at home as I did. It<lb/>
was good for me - although my work<lb/>
here did suffer in my absence.<lb/>
I wish you all could come to Cuba,<lb/>
just to see it. I don't think<lb/>
you would like it much, &amp; I<lb/>
doubt if you would be well here<lb/>
but I would like you to see the<lb/>
country. A country around<lb/>
Havana, of short, steep<lb/>
hills - look like little<lb/>
mountains &amp; there are a<lb/>
lot of little mountains<lb/>

5<lb/>
scattered about over the<lb/>
island, as if shaken from a<lb/>
dice-box - without any order<lb/>
or reason for <unclear>there</unclear> arrange-<lb/>
ment. The backbone of the<lb/>
island is <hi>not</hi> a range of<lb/>
mountains, as the map gives<lb/>
it. It is a <hi>plane</hi> - nearly ab-<lb/>
solutely <hi>barren</hi>. Mountains<lb/>
all along the coast, on the<lb/>
Western end &amp; on the south<lb/>
coast all the way- Indeed<lb/>
<hi>all</hi> of the coast except from<lb/>
Cardenas to <unclear>Nueritas</unclear>-<lb/>
found these places on the map)<lb/>
is mountainous &amp; therefore<lb/>
full of good harbors, some<lb/>
as Cienfuegos &amp; Havana, abso-<lb/>
lutely land-locked - like lakes.<lb/>

Almost. <del>I had to send</del><lb/>
I had to send one vessel<lb/>
to Tortugas to be disinfec-<lb/>
ted for plague - so that the<lb/>
<hi>rats</hi> might not swim a-<lb/>
shore.</p>
<p>Cherries should <hi>begin</hi> to be<lb/>
ripening now - ripe good<lb/>
in July, but it has been so<lb/>
cool &amp; pleasant here this week<lb/>
that I expect you have had<lb/>
weather too cool in Va.</p>
<p>Dear love to all</p>

Tell your<lb/>
