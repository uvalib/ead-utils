<salute>My dear General Reed:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you very kindly for your thoughtful letter of July 15.<lb/>
I am so glad that your sister was so pleased with the Cleveland affair.<lb/>
Although it was a small affair it was very impressive.</p>
<p>I appreciate very much your kind words about my paper. I sub-<lb/>
mitted it to Dr. Fishbein, who wants to publish it in Hygeia and I believe<lb/>
a black and white or possibly even a colored reproduction of the painting<lb/>
will be included with the talk. Reprints will be available and I shall<lb/>
be delighted to send you, your mother and your sister as many reprints as<lb/>
you would care to have.</p>
<p>Concerning the matter of Miss Wood. Her letters seem very gra-<lb/>
cious and I am glad to give her such information as I can. I think that<lb/>
she would get much more information if she were permitted to read your<lb/>
father's letters which your sister kindly showed me, than she would out<lb/>
of anything that I have, but until your sister is well enough to see her,<lb/>
this will have to be left to the future.</p>
<p>I am continuing my efforts to have the true site of Camp Lazear<lb/>
memorialized. These efforts have been delayed somewhat because of the<lb/>
great press of work here during the summer months. I hope to acquaint<lb/>
you with these efforts in more detail and Generals Kean and Ireland have<lb/>
promised to help me with this matter also.</p>
<p>I have been invited to speak before the American Academy of<lb/>
Orthopedic Surgeons which meets in Washington in January and if I cannot<lb/>
get there before that I sincerely hope to have the privilege of meeting<lb/>
you then.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
Major General Walter L. Reed<lb/>
2810 Thirty-sixth Place<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
