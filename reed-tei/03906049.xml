From Dr Ponce<lb/>
<dateline>
Habana Lunes <date value="1942-01-12">12 de Enero de 1942.</date>
</dateline>
Dr. Phillip S. Hench.<lb/>
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>About two weeks ago I received the tenth of December issue of the Mayo<lb/>
Clinic proceedings. Having found most interesting your article &ldquo;Conquerors of the<lb/>
Yellow Fever&rdquo; I translated it and took it to &ldquo;Salas Radio Station&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Headed by Dr. Donald Nelson, a group of American doctors were expected in<lb/>
Havana at that time for the formation of the Finlay Institute of the Americas.<lb/>
Thinking this was an appropriate moment Mr. Salas and I decided to inform the President<lb/>
of the Republic of your article and get his help for making Camp Lazear an international<lb/>
monument to the medical classes of Cuba and the United States. On the same day that<lb/>
the President decorated the American doctors, Mr. Salas spoke to him and got his <unclear>most</unclear><lb/>
enthusiastic approval. The President called Dr. Sergio Garcia Marruz, (acting Minister<lb/>
of Health and giving him my translation of your article begged of him a speedy study<lb/>
and information. Dr. G. Marruz found it extremely important and seconded our idea<lb/>
warmly.</p>
<p>Mr. Salas immediately informed the public over the air and has considered<lb/>
this scheme his most important transmission.</p>
<p>Last Saturday Salas and I went together to visit Dr. G. Marruz and talked<lb/>
to him for more than two hours of this subject. He is taking today Monday, this<lb/>
question to the Council of Ministers, at the Presidents request, to be discussed.<lb/>
They will try to find the way to solve this problem, and will probably have to send<lb/>
a message to the Congress to get his approval. This is the actual situation.</p>
<p>As Mr. Pogolotti and John J. Moran were mentioned in your article, I look<lb/>
for Mr. Pogolotti in the telephone book as soon as Mr. Salas had spoken to the President<lb/>
and made a date with him at the hospital where I work, to visit Camp Lazear. The next<lb/>
day Mr. Salas and I had the pleasure of meeting the most kindly Mr. Pogolotti and we<lb/>
all together visited, first the false site and then the real Camp Lazear at the San<lb/>
Jose farm. Mr. Pogolotti informed us of your extraordinary interest and work on this<lb/>
subject. He also gave us Mr. Moran's address and the same afternoon I paid him a<lb/>
visit. There I also heard many things about you.</p>
<p>According to what I had read in your article, Mrs. Morans and Pogolottis<lb/>
information and what I already knew personally, I wrote the notes that Dr. G. Marruz<lb/>
is taking to-day to the Council. I think that the Cuban Government can raise a building<lb/>
having Camp Lazear in <unclear>its</unclear> center, more or less following the sketch you gave to Mr.<lb/>
Pogolotti.</p>
<p>It is my idea, and I think also the Presidents to make a ceremony at the<lb/>
dedication of this memorial.</p>
<p>(over)</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03906050"/>
<p>I am looking forward to an interview with the President, and then if this<lb/>
takes place, I will send you more details about the venture.</p>
<p>I want to give you my ideas about this subject. I understand that the<lb/>
would be memorial building, should be a monument to the Cuban and American medical<lb/>
classes. It is my intention not to accept discussions as to whether the monument<lb/>
should be dedicated to any special person. I have the impression, drawn from your<lb/>
article that you have the same opinion. I sincerely believe that is the only way<lb/>
in which we can carry out our idea with success.</p>
<p>I want you to know that my interest in this subject is greatly intensified<lb/>
by the fact that you are a doctor of the Mayo Clinic that I visited twice, and where<lb/>
Dr. Fred Rankin removed my thyroid gland years ago with the greatest success.</p>
<p>I hope to receive your opinion and any ideas that you have for this memorial<lb/>
project as soon as possible.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Dr. Felipe Carbonell Ponce<lb/>
San Lazaro 413<lb/>
Habana, Cuba</signed>
<seg>
P.S.<lb/>
I am decidedly against transferring Camp Lazear to any other site.<lb/>
