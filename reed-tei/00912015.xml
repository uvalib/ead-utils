<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of July 20 has been received.<lb/>
We shall be pleased to keep you in touch with the<lb/>
development of the work in Peru. The letter Mr Rose<lb/>
sent you today gives the latest information we have<lb/>
from Doctor White. We have not heard from him since<lb/>
he reached Peru.</p>
<p>A letter from Doctor Hanson received this<lb/>
week contains the following information:</p>
<p>"It appears that our work in connection with<lb/>
the cold weather will prevent a sharp epidemic in the city<lb/>
of Trujillo. Our percentage of breeding there has been re-<lb/>
duced to 4%, as calculated by the reports turned in by the<lb/>
Inspectors and Domiciliary Visitors. This figure, however,<lb/>
does not show the work actually done because lately Dr. Tapia<lb/>
who is the Provincial Director had ordered that nothing but<lb/>
barrels, botijas, tinajas, tanks and wells should figure as<lb/>
a container or deposit examined. It happens that in Trujillo<lb/>
there are many &ldquo;corralones&rdquo; i.e., a specie of departments or<lb/>
flats, which have a common door or entrance from the street,<lb/>
and in many of these we have from ten to twenty apartments,<lb/>
in each of which there is a family. Since the campaign has<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00912016"/>
Doctor Henry R Carter<lb/>

2.<lb/>
been intensified all forms of containers with the ex-<lb/>
ception of buckets and tin cans have been prohibited<lb/>
in these apartments, with the result that the visitor<lb/>
or inspector may visit as many as twenty families with-<lb/>
out a single large &ldquo;deposito&rdquo; to figure in sum on which<lb/>
the percentage is calculated. In Trujillo we do not<lb/>
find larvae in these small containers, they are emptied<lb/>
daily. In order to show the true percentage of foci of<lb/>
breeding we will have to adopt a different basis for the<lb/>
calculations and reports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Libertad deaths have occurred in the follow-<lb/>
ing places; - Pacanga, Pueblo Nuevo, Guadelupe, San Pedro,<lb/>
Malabrigo, Paujan, Ascope, Casa Grande, and Trujillo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"In so far as the spread south is concerned, that<lb/>
is the point which is causing me the greatest worry. Our<lb/>
land quarantine seems to be of very small value....We have<lb/>
relied on the desert of Viru, but even that is not a sure<lb/>
guarantee. I have requested a double &ldquo;cordon sanitario&rdquo;,<lb/>
one immediately south of the town of Viru, and another<lb/>
guarding all the principal points of the boundry between<lb/>
Libertad and Ancash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have more assurance, I have engaged Dr.<lb/>
Enrique Caballero, for special investigation of the coast<lb/>
between Libertad and Callao. He is thoroughly reliable<lb/>
and has the same opinions in this matter as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In regard to Inspectors, I have taken every-<lb/>
body available from the organization which Dr. Carter and I<lb/>
had in Piura. In addition we have trained and are training<lb/>
a great many in both Departments (Libertad and Lambayeque)<lb/>
but the campaign is so immense that it takes time to get a<lb/>
sufficient number of reliable men trained and located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"The present I consider the most critical period<lb/>
of the campaign. The number of cases is everywhere di-<lb/>
minishing, and as a result the people lose their fear and<lb/>
have a tendency to grow careless thinking that it is all over.<lb/>
At such a time we need the best help available until we have<lb/>
passed the critical period, and can enter the prophylactic<lb/>

campaign proper, by this I mean the time when we are<lb/>
fairly certain that we have had our last cases, and the<lb/>
quarantine restrictions can be less rigorous. This I expect<lb/>
to accomplish within the next three months, providing Dr.<lb/>
Caballero does not find that something has escaped us farther<lb/>
to the south. The whole thing depends on the latter observation;<lb/>
<hi>if we are still safe on this point we will do the job this<lb/>
year</hi>. The presence of Corrigan and Pickett will be needed<lb/>
for about two to three months more to help assure this result.</p>
<p>"We are using all the fish available in all<lb/>
sectors of the campaign. We have a fish here which they call<lb/>
&ldquo;majarra&rdquo; which is a voracious larva consumer, I believe even<lb/>
more so than the gambusia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are using all means we can think of to combat<lb/>
the larvae breeding.&rdquo;</p>
