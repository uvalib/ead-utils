Do you know I wish much that I had included my<lb/>

Byam his choice of <del>accepting it</del> including<lb/>
it or of throwing the whole thing out? He had taken it,<lb/>

<salute>My Dear Daughter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This is the 40<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> anniversary of my appoint-<lb/>
ment in the service. I took the oath about the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I think</p>
<p>It is a long time to look back to &amp; the service has certainly<lb/>
grown. It had 34 medical officers then &amp; practically <hi>no</hi><lb/>
sanitary functions. I had much-more than any other<lb/>
field-officer-in the developing of these.</p>
<p>I am glad I joined. I don't think I have had as<lb/>
happy a life as <del>the average</del> if I had stayed in private<lb/>
practice - yet am I content. I have lived a <hi>satisfac-<lb/>
tory</hi> life &amp; a very <hi>full</hi> life: I have seen many things<lb/>
&amp; seen them clearly &amp; entirely: I have taken part in<lb/>
not a fun important things myself &amp; some I have<lb/>
done myself &amp; of my own initiative. It has been<lb/>
very full of interest &amp; <del>man</del> somethings I have<lb/>
enjoyed<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00818066"/>
2<lb/>
enjoyed intensely- All of the early struggle<lb/>
in the upbuilding of the national quarantine in which<lb/>
I <hi>know</hi> we would-succeed- &amp; in which we did; the<lb/>
work on Extrinsic Incubation - after the groping<lb/>
for a clue <del>had been</del> was over: the early work in Pan-<lb/>
ama- say the first <del>2 years</del><add>18 or 20 months</add> during which I was<lb/>
always as sure of success as I am now. I have fought<lb/>
<del>hopeless fights</del> lost-fights &amp; won them by shear de-<lb/>
termination. but in most of my work I have felt<lb/>
more than a hope- a <hi>certainty</hi> of success. I confess I<lb/>
have not enjoyed the &ldquo;gandium <unclear>certaminis</unclear>&rdquo; as<lb/>
much as a more aggressive man would have done.</p>
<p>My life work really began in Jan/88 at Ship Is-<lb/>
land. The 9 years preceeding it had been about like<lb/>
the life of any other man who was doing professional<lb/>
work. I will say that I had never failed to give the best that<lb/>
was in me to my patients. With Ship Island the sani-<lb/>
tary problems presented themselves &amp; on them I have<lb/>
mainly been engaged- in research: exposition &amp; exec-<lb/>
utive - almost ever since</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00818067"/>
<p>3</p>
<p>The malaria work <add>sin 1912</add> I count in the above &amp; it has<lb/>
been on the whole good work, and capable of almost<lb/>
indefinite expansion. That LePrince is with the ser-<lb/>
vice in which he is more useful than he would be<lb/>
anywhere else- I also count to my credit. I am<lb/>
sorry for the delay &amp; shilly shallying(?) about the<lb/>
malaria this year I fear too from Williams opinion<lb/>
that Fricks is not the man for the job. By the way a<lb/>
decidedly able man is Louis &amp; even if he draws out<lb/>
from malaria. will still be a useful officer - as his fa-<lb/>
ther has been. nevertheless I think he will miss his<lb/>
highest efficiency. Bless Gertrude she is not worth<lb/>
what she costs - i.e. is a social loss.</p>
<p>I was evidently the sicker that I thought but have been<lb/>
up in a wheel chair, Saturday: yesterday &amp; today &amp; pre-<lb/>
sume I will be able to learn with in a wish. I am con-<lb/>
valescing fast, but have not attempted to walk- ex-<lb/>
cept from the chair to the bed. The nursing here is better<lb/>
than that in the private rooms at Hopkins. I expect that the<lb/>
Pneumonia Vaccine saved my life. If it did anything it<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00818068"/>
4<lb/>
did- Because after 3<del>1/2</del> days of considerable toxaemia I<lb/>
developed a general Capillary Bronchitis with <hi>some</hi>; don't know how much, bronchopneumonia. Well it is over<lb/>
&amp; I only regret that I have lost so much time - over<lb/>
4 weeks in all. Lord, I am glad that I have the<lb/>
Atlantic City Article written.</p>
<p>I am very sorry for Henry's change of orders I<lb/>
&amp; he &amp; your mother would have enjoyed his vi-<lb/>
sit home, It is too far to come now I judge- although<lb/>
he gets <hi>I think</hi>. a fare of 1 cent a mile, Too far however.<lb/>
I fear.</p>
<p>Give my love to your mother &amp; to Mary &amp; Jennie &amp; to<lb/>
Gertrude if she be still with you.</p>
<p>The little Iris-the Crimean Iris-at the North end,<lb/>
of the rows sh'd be in bloom now - although I<lb/>
rather hope they wait until a week later.</p>
<p>This long letter written partly in bed &amp; partly in the<lb/>
wheel chair is <del>proff</del> proof. that I am quite strong<lb/>
