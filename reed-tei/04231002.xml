DR. PHILIP S. HENCH<lb/>
<dateline>
MAYO CLINIC<lb/>
ROCHESTER, MINN.<lb/>
<date value="1948-04-20">April 20, 1948</date>
</dateline>
His Excellency<lb/>
The Minister of Public Works<lb/>
Republic of Cuba<lb/>
Habana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>Your Excellency:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Last month (on March 10) Dr. Felipe Carbonell and Senor Honorato<lb/>
Colete brought me to your office to meet you. Unfortunately I was unable to<lb/>
get an appointment to see you but we discussed with your secretary a plan for<lb/>
the preservation of &ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo; and the caseta (Major Walter Reed's<lb/>
&ldquo;Building Number One&rdquo;) which still remains adjacent to the Macia-Zunqunegui<lb/>
quarries behind the Finca San Jose in Quemados. It was at Camp Lazear and in<lb/>
this <unclear>caseta</unclear> that Reed and his colleagues proved the mosquito theory of your<lb/>
illustrious countryman, Dr. Carlos Finlay.</p>
<p>Camp Lazear was &ldquo;lost&rdquo; for 40 years until Mr. John Moran, Mr. Pogolotti<lb/>
(both of Havana) and I hunted for it and found it in 1940. Since then it has<lb/>
been my sincere hope that we could preserve the caseta and memorialize Camp<lb/>
Lazear by erecting a small <hi>Cuban-American memorial</hi>. In 1900 Camp Lazear was<lb/>
a part of the Finca San Jose. It is particularly appropriate to memorialize<lb/>
this spot because it was also at the Finca San Jose (in the Quinta) that<lb/>
Doctor Finlay himself performed a few of his earliest mosquito inoculations<lb/>
in <hi>1883</hi>.</p>
<p>I have been unhappy to find that in certain American circles not<lb/>
enough is known about the pioneering work of Doctor Finlay, and in certain<lb/>
Cuban circles not enough is known of the work of the United States Army<lb/>
Board. I have noted an unfortunate attitude between those who would give<lb/>
all the credit to the Americans and those who would give all the credit to<lb/>
Doctor Finlay. In this magnificent medical achievement, so beneficial to<lb/>
all mankind, there is surely sufficient glory for <hi>all</hi> who, united in a common<lb/>
cause, constituted one of the greatest &ldquo;teams&rdquo; in all medical history. With<lb/>
this in mind, it seems most appropriate to memorialize the services of all<lb/>
concerned. Thus the unfortunate debate as to the relative merits of one or<lb/>
the other group will be forgotten.</p>
<p>My original plan was very modest. I had hoped to raise certain funds<lb/>
among American friends so that the caseta could be preserved on the spot within<lb/>
a little Cuban-American Medical Memorial in which would also be kept originals<lb/>
or copies of many souvenirs which I have, concerning the conquest of yellow<lb/>
fever. Before the war the Mayo Clinic promised me a sum up to $10,000 contingent<lb/>
upon the gifts of others and upon the assumption that the Cuban Government would<lb/>
accept the gifts and care for the memorial. I had planned to raise about<lb/>
$35,000. Then came the war; I entered military service and had to abandon<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04231003"/>
His Excellency, The Minister of Public Works<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
April 20, 1948<lb/>
my plans temporarily.</p>
<p>During and since the war, I have had brief correspondence with<lb/>
certain interested Cuban physicians, Doctors Presno, Nogueira and Carbonell<lb/>
but could do nothing directly. I was delighted to hear that last year<lb/>
the Cuban Government designated the caseta a &ldquo;National Monument&rdquo;. But no<lb/>
funds were available for its preservation.</p>
<p>On my recent trip to Havana, I discussed the matter at some length<lb/>
with Doctors Carbonell, Nogueira and Presno and with Senor Colete. Through<lb/>
the courtesy of Doctor Carbonell, I also had the privilege of discussing it<lb/>
with His Excellency, Vice President <unclear>Paul</unclear> de Cardenas. All of these gentlemen<lb/>
appeared to be in hearty approval.</p>
<p>Fearing that the caseta might deteriorate even more seriously or might<lb/>
even be destroyed (as was &ldquo;Building Number Two&rdquo; in the tornado of 1926) I asked<lb/>
Senor Adrian Macia, owner of the property upon which the caseta stands, to erect<lb/>
at my expense, a protecting galvanized iron cover around and over the caseta.<lb/>
Thus the caseta would be protected while plans for its proper preservation were<lb/>
proceeding. But because the caseta is now a &ldquo;National Monument&rdquo; Senor Macia<lb/>
told me that I could not do this at my own expense without government permission.<lb/>
It was then that we visited Vice President Cardenas, and I repeated my offer, but<lb/>
he stated his belief that the caseta would be properly cared for while plans<lb/>
were materializing.</p>
<p>Doctor Carbonell and I then discussed another plan with Senor Cardenas.<lb/>
It would assuredly be better if the Cuban-American Memorial could be useful as<lb/>
well as ornamental. We discussed the possibility of erecting not just a little<lb/>
&ldquo;museum-building&rdquo; around the caseta, but a somewhat larger building to be used<lb/>
as a small dispensario or unit for the Public Health Department of Quemados de<lb/>
Marianao. In this case the caseta would be housed in a &ldquo;museum-room&rdquo; which would<lb/>
be part of a Public Health unit.</p>
<p>The remains of Camp Lazear are surrounded by small homes for humble work-<lb/>
ing people. It would indeed be fine if our memorial could serve these people in a<lb/>
truly useful way.</p>
<p>Since my return home I have been delighted to learn that your depart-<lb/>
ment has asked for, and (I understand) been authorized to expend $50,000 for the<lb/>
preservation of the caseta, etc. Your Excellency, in writing you I do not wish<lb/>
to intrude unduly in this matter but I do wish to express to you directly my<lb/>
continuing great personal interest in this project and my desire to serve you<lb/>
and my Cuban friends in any way I can.</p>
<p>I have given some thought to the manner of the memorial and enclose<lb/>
herewith some rough sketches which illustrate my preliminary ideas.<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>Item 1 shows the caseta, &ldquo;Building Number One&rdquo;, as it now stands.</item>
<item>Item 2 shows an air-view (a photostat of a photograph; I regret<lb/>
that I have no clearer view) of the remains of Camp Lazear in relation to the<lb/>
Finca San Jose. The caseta is beneath the tree at (X). Reed's Building Number<lb/>
Two was 80 yards in front of the caseta. Originally it had a wooden floor but<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f04231004"/>
His Excellency, The Minister of Public Works<lb/>
-3-<lb/>
April 20, 1948<lb/>
this rotted and Senor Zunzunegui put in a concrete floor. Since this building<lb/>
blew down in 1926 the broken remains of the concrete floor mark the spot in the<lb/>
corn field. (at X in the photograph).</item>
<item>Item 3 shows the location of Camp Lazear on the map of the Reparto<lb/>
Pogolotti.</item>
<item>Item 4 shows my ideas regarding the preservation and beautification<lb/>
of Camp Lazear. May I ask your consideration of the following ideas.<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(a) <hi>Park</hi>: May I suggest that the corn field in front of the caseta<lb/>
be purchased and made into a little park which (I should think) would be a<lb/>
welcome addition to the working people living nearby. Entrance to the park<lb/>
could be had merely by extending Calle Luis Valdes Carrero (or Calle Manuel<lb/>
Gomez).</item>
<item><p>(b) <hi>The Caseta</hi>: could be protected by having it enclosed in a<lb/>
&ldquo;museum-room&rdquo;. If it is not possible now to build a larger building (a small<lb/>
unit to serve the people usefully in some manner such as would a health unit)<lb/>
at least the &ldquo;museum&rdquo; could be erected now, being planned so as to harmonize<lb/>
with later construction. Item 5 shows a rough sketch of the interior of the<lb/>
museum or &ldquo;museum room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roadway leading from Calle Luis Valdes Carrero could enter the<lb/>
little park through an ornamental gate-way, then approach the museum and health<lb/>
unit by making a circle.</p></item>
<item>(c) Approximately in the center of the circle and where &ldquo;Building<lb/>
Number Two&rdquo; (The &ldquo;Mosquito Building&rdquo;) stood could be erected an appropriate<lb/>
memorial marker.</item>
<item>(d) Because the adjacent quarries make the land look somewhat un-<lb/>
sightly the little park would look much nicer if a low stone wall surrounded<lb/>
it. Perhaps the park will be beautified with trees and flower-beds. Here and<lb/>
there in the park could be erected (perhaps against the wall) six or eight<lb/>
stone seats something like those in the Prado.</item>
<item>(e) Naming the memorials. My suggestions along this line are merely<lb/>
offered for your preliminary consideration. My desire is to honor all those<lb/>
who joined in the conquest of yellow fever. May I suggest that the whole project<lb/>
be known as the <hi>Cuban-American Memorial</hi> and that this name be on the gate-way.<lb/>
The civic unit could be named the <hi>Finlay Building</hi>, the <hi>Finlay Health Unit</hi> or<lb/>
the <hi>Finlay Health Clinic</hi> or some such designation. The museum or museum-room<lb/>
housing the caseta could be named the <hi>Reed Memorial</hi>. The memorial marker in the<lb/>
center of the park (on the former site of &ldquo;Building Two&rdquo;) could be small or large,<lb/>
perhaps a simple marble or stone shaft bearing the names of all the participants<lb/>
(Doctors Finlay, Delgado, Redd, Carroll, Agramonte and Lazear and <unclear>Mezers</unclear>. Moran<lb/>
and Kissinger, Doctor Cooke and the 11 other American and Spanish volunteers.<lb/>
If stone (or marble) seats are set up in the park and are of sufficient beauty<lb/>
and dignity they could bear the names (simply out into the stone or on small<lb/>
attached bronze markers) of certain distinguished persons who aided Finlay and<lb/>
Reed, persons whose services were noteworthy, but of lesser value (such as<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f04231005"/>
His Excellency, The Minister of Public Works<lb/>
-4-<lb/>
April 20, 1948<lb/>
General Wood, Major Kean, Doctors Gorgas and Guiteras, Doctor Ames, and<lb/>
Miss Clara Maass who died of experimental yellow fever).</item>
</list></item>
</list></p>
<p>Not to detract in any way from the sentiments implicit in my designa-<lb/>
tion of the whole Project as the <hi>Cuban-American Memorial</hi>, may I suggest that<lb/>
the little park itself be named &ldquo;Parque Lazear&rdquo;. This would perpetuate (in a new<lb/>
version) the old historical designation &ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo;. You may recall that the<lb/>
spot was named Camp Lazear to honor the memory of the heroic martyr, Dr. Jesse<lb/>
W. Lazear, who died from what was, in all likelihood, deliberately accepted ex-<lb/>
perimental yellow fever.</p>
<p>If it seems best to use only four names I suggest the museum (containing<lb/>
the caseta) be called <hi>The Reed Museum</hi>, the civic unit be called &ldquo;<hi>The Finlay Building</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
the grounds be called &ldquo;<hi>Lazear Park</hi>&rdquo; and the designation of the whole project,<lb/>
<hi>The Cuban-American Memorial</hi>, be placed at the entrance. The colleagues of<lb/>
Finlay and of Reed can be duly honored by appropriate inscriptions on the<lb/>
central marker and by data within the museum.</p>
<p>As to the material within the museum-room: I have much data- old and<lb/>
new photographs of the places and persons concerned, original letters, old maps and<lb/>
documents, original medical charts of the patients who developed experimental<lb/>
yellow fever, etc., etc. I would be very glad to supply some originals and<lb/>
some duplicates of these items to be placed in display cabinets, some on the<lb/>
wall, some around the room. Copies or originals of data concerning Doctors<lb/>
Finlay and Delgado should of course also be procured. It was my thought to<lb/>
remove, of course, all parts which have been attached to Building Number One<lb/>
which did not originally belong to it; two such additions have already been<lb/>
removed; a rear addition (kitchen) remains. Enough of the rear wall of the<lb/>
caseta could be removed (and the original wood used to restore the original<lb/>
left front window) to allow visitors to look into the caseta from the rear.<lb/>
The inside of the caseta should be restored to resemble its original appearance<lb/>
with Army cots, boxes of &ldquo;soiled linen&rdquo;, an Army stove, etc. (These can be pro-<lb/>
cured, I believe, from the U. S. Army).</p>
<p>Your Excellency, please accept these suggestions for what they are worth.<lb/>
Undoubtedly you and your colleagues will have many ideas superior and more<lb/>
practical than some of mine. Should you care to consult Mr. John Moran (one<lb/>
of Major Reed's original volunteers for experimental yellow fever) about the<lb/>
historical phases of the work, I am sure he would gladly cooperate (He lives<lb/>
at Calle 25, No. 804, Entre B y C, Apartment Number 3, Vedado).<lb/>
Doctors Carbonell and Nogueira are also quite familiar with many of these data;<lb/>
they and Senor Macia would also cooperate fully, I am sure. They have been<lb/>
most courteous and helpful to me.</p>
<p>I realize that to develop plans of sufficient dignity, beauty and<lb/>
practicality will take some time. If there is any likelihood that the delay<lb/>
in allotting funds and starting work may be dangerous for the &ldquo;life&rdquo; of the<lb/>
caseta, may I express to you again my willingness to help meet the immediate<lb/>
need to preserve the caseta from the hazards of hurricanes, weather, storm and<lb/>
use, by making now a gift of $1,000.00 to enclose the caseta in a galvanized<lb/>
iron cover.</p>

<p>Believe me, sir, it has given me great satisfaction to have had<lb/>
a small part in the early phases of this venture. I have enjoyed greatly the<lb/>
most pleasant contacts I have had with your countrymen. I shall be happy to<lb/>
do anything I can to further the project and to serve the memories of those<lb/>
we together choose to honor.</p>
