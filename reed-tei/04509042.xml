and may be when you come we will discuss to place another in the<lb/>
Clinic name, on Dr Finlay tomb at the cementery on the official<lb/>

<p>Also I would be glad you bring the copies of the address in<lb/>
spanish, why so easier for everybody and with pleasure we will<lb/>
revise the text to your desire, although I am sure their will be<lb/>
no reason to modify it, because you know almost like I the cubans.</p>
<p>Is is lamentable that Hanberry is unable to attend the act,<lb/>
why that was the most sentimental part of it; but I hope to reco-<lb/>
mend somebody else, joined on that days can unveil the busts and<lb/>
plates (may be Mrs Ames).-</p>
