<salute>My dear Colonel Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>It has been a month and a<lb/>
week since I had that fine long<lb/>
letter from you and I cannot let<lb/>
this month go by without a request<lb/>
for news. So many things may<lb/>
happen in a month in war time!<lb/>
I had an idea that Mr. Kellogg<lb/>
told you, when he was in Denver<lb/>
and saw you and Mrs. Hench at<lb/>
dinner, of the wonderful surprise<lb/>
that he and Col. Hume had in<lb/>
store for me - the Gorgas medal<lb/>
with a fine fat prize of $500<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> for<lb/>
work done long ago. In the letter<lb/>
of notification which came from<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06310188"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
2<lb/>
the Sec'y of the Assn of Military Surgeons<lb/>
(of which I hope you are now a member) Col.<lb/>
Phalen, on Oct. 15, he said it was<lb/>
awarded to me and to two others &ldquo;for dis-<lb/>
tinguished services in preventive medicine<lb/>
for our armed forces&rdquo;. I have not<lb/>
yet seen what was enumerated in<lb/>
the formal citation, but understood<lb/>
from Col. Hume that it would include<lb/>
initiating the warfare against the<lb/>
mosquito in Cuba in October 1900, for<lb/>
initiating the legislation to create the<lb/>
Medical Reserve Corps in 1904 and for<lb/>
organizing the Base Hospitals in parent<lb/>
institutions in 1916. I think that the<lb/>
creation of the Medical Reserve Corps<lb/>
was my best job. It took a long, hard<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06310189"/>
3<lb/>
fight of 4 years to get it past the<lb/>
General Staff and through Congress.<lb/>
It became a law in 1908. The Navy M.C.<lb/>
imitated it the next year and in eight<lb/>
years more the General had learned<lb/>
that it would be a wonderful agency<lb/>
for expansion for war and they adopt-<lb/>
ed it for the entire army -(in 1916)<lb/>
The Rip Van Winkle sleep of the Gorgas<lb/>
medal for 26 years after its creation in<lb/>
1916 is a curious and long story. I<lb/>
will not go into it unless I hear that<lb/>
Mr. Kellogg did not tell it to you<lb/>
as an after - dinner story, and that<lb/>
you are interested to hear it.</p>
<p>From the intermission in your<lb/>
correspondent I feel sure that you<lb/>
are very busy and that you have<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06310190"/>
4<lb/>
not been able to secure a fine capable<lb/>
WAAC to be your stenog. &amp; secretary-like<lb/>
the Secy at Rochester whom you miss so<lb/>
much. I had a visit from General Ireland<lb/>
yesterday and he inquired if there was<lb/>
any news of you. He had just returned<lb/>
from Louisville,Ky. where was a meeting<lb/>
of the Nat. Med. Exam. Board. Today he<lb/>
goes to New York to some medical meet-<lb/>
ing in which the A. M. A. is interested.<lb/>
They keep him busy with jobs, in which<lb/>
he has only the reward of a good conscience</p>
<p>I realize perfectly what little time you<lb/>
have for letter writing, but a single page, or<lb/>
even a plebean postal is much better<lb/>
than nothing. The fight in the Solomons<lb/>
keeps us all anxious as doubtless it does you.</p>
