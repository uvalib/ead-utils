Dr. C. E. Finlay<lb/>
Vedado, Habana<lb/>
Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Finlay:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciate greatly your very nice Christmas card and especially<lb/>
your letter of December 22.</p>
<p>I am delighted to have you make any comments on my papers that you<lb/>
see fit to make. You say that you disagree with my repeated statement that<lb/>
your father did not produce a single case of experimental yellow fever. I<lb/>
think if you will re-read my paper carefully you will see in the last para-<lb/>
graph of the first column on page 2 that I carefully worded the following<lb/>
sentence: &ldquo;But nobody believed him simply because, although he had inoculated<lb/>
over 100 volunteers with mosquitoes, he hadn't produced a single case of the<lb/>
disease <hi>which other physicians regarded</hi> as unquestionably induced or experimental<lb/>
rather than probably spontaneous.&rdquo; Please note that I have carefully worded this<lb/>
&ldquo;which other physicians regarded&rdquo;. I think that is the true statement of affairs<lb/>
and does not enter into the controversy as to whether they were actually cases of<lb/>
yellow fever or not. That controversy did not belong in this particular paper<lb/>
that I wrote. It belongs to my larger study which I hope to publish in due time<lb/>
and I can assure you I am trying to investigate every angle of the claims made<lb/>
for your father. There seems little doubt but that a number of his patients did<lb/>
develop yellow fever apparently not within the time limits set by the board.<lb/>
I am getting in touch with a number of the modern yellow fever experts such<lb/>
as Dr. Wilbur Sawyer and others and before publishing my final work will certainly<lb/>
re-investigate current ideas on the time limit of incubation period, etc. I am<lb/>
quite prepared to revise my opinions regarding this. But please let me assure you,<lb/>
Dr. Finlay, that I am utterly and completely convinced of the tremendous contribu-<lb/>
tion which your father made. Regardless of whether he was able to prove his theory<lb/>
with complete success or not, his brilliant conception and the wonderful tenacity<lb/>
which which he developed his ideas and kept at his theory are deserving of only<lb/>
the highest praise. Without him and his work the conquest of yellow fever might<lb/>
not yet have been accomplished. I am sure that you will be satisfied with what<lb/>
I finally write and I intend to submit my preliminary manuscripts to you and others<lb/>
in Cuba for your critical appraisal. Let me assure you also that I have the greatest<lb/>
and most sincere admiration for your father and it is my hope that I can reintro-<lb/>
duce him in fuller glory to the American public and medical profession.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
