<p>I was most interested<lb/>
in this <hi>file</hi> of Reed's</p>
<p>Only a few notes were<lb/>
made on these yellow<lb/>

seems to be complete.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen<lb/>
the <unclear>Wasdin &amp; Geddings</unclear> <del>report</del><add>article</add><lb/>
about the Preliminary Report?</p>
<p>I think that it came out<lb/>
about a month or two after<lb/>
the Board's report &amp; in the same<lb/>
Journal. You should see it.</p>
