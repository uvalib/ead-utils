Dr. L. M. Tocantins<lb/>
The Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia<lb/>
1025 Walnut Street<lb/>
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Tocantins:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Because of my professional obligations and the holiday activities, I have<lb/>
been delayed in preparing the enclosed long personal letter written for<lb/>
the relatives of those honored at the dedication of Camp Lazear. I thought<lb/>
you might like a copy and perhaps Dean Bennett or Mr. Rake might like to see<lb/>
a copy (If they want their own copies we can have one or two more made up<lb/>
as they are <unclear>ozalid</unclear> copies.).</p>
<p>I received from Dean Bennett a check for $18 which represents an over-<lb/>
payment of $3.00 I am sending him my own personal check for that amount.</p>
<p>I am very glad indeed for the participation of Jefferson Medical College<lb/>
in this affair. I am most happy that Dean Bennett asked you to go and that<lb/>
you were able to accept. Your presence was much more important than per-<lb/>
haps you realized as I think you will gather from the tenor of my letter.</p>
<p>Two or three photographs were taken by news photographers of you, laying<lb/>
the wreath and speaking. I have copies. After you left, many other<lb/>
<unclear>photographs</unclear> were given to me so that I have quite a few, but an incomplete<lb/>
collection of photographs of the whole ceremony. Doctor Nogueira promised<lb/>
to borrow the films from the news photographers and send them to me shortly<lb/>
if you wish further copies. I do hope you enjoyed your visit and it was<lb/>
certainly grand that you were there. The Cubans certainly appreciated<lb/>
it.</p>
<p>Although we can provide an extra copy or two of the letter enclosed, I have<lb/>
no further copies of the newspaper clippings; therefore you may wish to show<lb/>
these to Dean Bennett and/or Mr. Rake. Should you wish to write up some-<lb/>
thing about the dedication for the Jefferson Medical Alumni, please feel<lb/>
free to borrow anything you want from my letter without acknowledgement.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it greatly if you would send me a copy of your speech.<lb/>
Although you gave it informally, I suspect you had something in the way of<lb/>
notes or could reconstruct it. I should like very much to have this.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
