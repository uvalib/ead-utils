<p>Your nice, long<lb/>
letter to Helen came to-<lb/>
day, but, as the Bunnie<lb/>
Sister, is very much used<lb/>
up today I will answer<lb/>
some of your questions.<lb/>
You must send all<lb/>
packages to Rannie, for<lb/>
then they are passed<lb/>
through the custom house.<lb/>
Registered mail seems to<lb/>
be about one week in<lb/>
coming. I think you had<lb/>
better send bundles to<lb/>
this address, then Rannie<lb/>
is not bothered to bring<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14345002"/>
them out from town-<lb/>
Columbia B'ks, Cuba, is<lb/>
all the address needed,<lb/>
for this is a P. O. of itself.<lb/>
The veils came very prompt-<lb/>
ly, and thanks for the<lb/>
white ribbon, it is a<lb/>
great boon. Be sure and<lb/>
let me know if the<lb/>
five pesos I sent last<lb/>
month were enough for<lb/>
the slippers and veils.</p>
<p>Rannie left yesterday<lb/>
for Puerto Principe, and<lb/>
I am afraid he won't<lb/>
be back before the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.<lb/>
There is a norther blow-<lb/>
ing now, so I imagine<lb/>
Rannie is being very much<lb/>
tossed around, as he goes<lb/>
down the north coast to<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14345003"/>
Nuevitas, and Rannie is such a poor sailor.<lb/>
Yesterday we had a nice little trip to<lb/>
Morro &amp; Caba&ntilde;a. Capt. Foltz of the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> <unclear>Cao.</unclear><lb/>
(the chief or boss of the Havana police) had<lb/>
made two efforts to take us, but each<lb/>
time Martha's sickness prevented us, but<lb/>
finally, yesterday I felt I could go, so<lb/>
we three went into town on the eleven<lb/>
o'clock train. Capt. Foltz's carriage met<lb/>
us at Concha and we went to his<lb/>
house to luncheon. Ourselves, Capt. F., Lieut.<lb/>
Wells &amp; Col. Noyes were the party. After lunch<lb/>
we boarded a launch and went over<lb/>
to Morro, then we walked to Caba&ntilde;a and<lb/>
went over that. As it was a heavenly<lb/>
day the views were beautiful. Then Capt.<lb/>
Foltz took us all around the harbor in<lb/>
his launch, we even went a little way<lb/>
outside of the Morro, to get the lovely colors<lb/>
in the water and on the sides of the<lb/>
old castle. Our carriage met us at the<lb/>
wharf and we reached home about<lb/>
half past five, rather tired, but having<lb/>
had a most satisfactory day.</p>
<p>Tonight there is to be a hop. Mr. Wells<lb/>
and Mr. Ginty (one of the new lieutenants here)<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14345004"/>
are coming to dinner.</p>
<p>The poor Bun seems to<lb/>
be out of it tonight, I<lb/>
am sorry to say.</p>
<p>Martha is very much<lb/>
better, and allowed to<lb/>
go out, tho' still some-<lb/>
what deaf. Her <del>left</del><add>right</add>, ear<lb/>
finally began to discharge,<lb/>
and the Dr., found the<lb/>
drum a little perforated,<lb/>
but if she had an<lb/>
abcess of the inner ear I<lb/>
don't see why she didn't<lb/>
suffer more- The discharge<lb/>
has stopped now and when<lb/>
I get <add>out</add> the wax <del>has</del><add>that</add> seems<lb/>
to <add>have</add> accumulated in her<lb/>
left ear, and the cotton out<lb/>
of her right, I think she<lb/>
will be able to hear well<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14345005"/>
again. Dr. Howard has<lb/>
given me a tonic for her,<lb/>
for she looks very white<lb/>
a thin since her five<lb/>
days in bed. Mr. Bobs<lb/>
is blooming, and getting<lb/>
so cunning. We will have<lb/>
some more pictures of<lb/>
him to send you soon.</p>
<p>I am surprised Rannie<lb/>
wrote you about Dick's<lb/>
experimental case of yellow<lb/>
fever, for Dick does not<lb/>
want the news to reach<lb/>
his mother, so made<lb/>
us promise not to tell.<lb/>
It came off in October,<lb/>
while Dr. Carroll was<lb/>
here, and he had a<lb/>
very mild case, but per-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14345006"/>
fectly clearly marked. Helen will have<lb/>
to write you all the details and the<lb/>
whys and wherefares, for I haven't time<lb/>
today. I went over to see Dick while<lb/>
he was sick in bed.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear Dollie is having<lb/>
a good time in Boston- Give my love<lb/>
to Tom and all the family</p>
<closer>
<salute>As ever your very loving</salute>

The N. A. squadron is due here<lb/>
on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Another reason for Miss<lb/>
Bun to put off her return.<lb/>
