Editor, Youth's Companion,<lb/>
Boston, Mass.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>The article, &ldquo;Lessons From Little Things,&rdquo; on page 15<lb/>
of The Companion for Jan. 10, was very interesting to me because I<lb/>
am well acquainted with John R. Kissinger, one of the heroes who<lb/>
submitted to being bitten by fever-infected mosquitoes.</p>
<p>I have seen the chart on which the record of his fever<lb/>
was kept, also the fine watch on which his name and the words, for<lb/>
courage, were inscribed. This watch was presented to him by the<lb/>
surgeons with whom he was associated.</p>
<p>The article in your paper states that he made a complete<lb/>
recovery and it was thought that he had, but he has been much<lb/>
afflicted during the last three years, and the physicians think<lb/>
it is from the effect of yellow fever. For several months he has<lb/>
been unable to walk on account of spinal trouble, and he is in poor<lb/>
financial circumstances.</p>
<p>He has married since the war, and now resides at 606,<lb/>
Keasey St., South Bend, Indiana.</p>
<p>Although he cannot walk he gets on his knees and helps<lb/>
do washing, which he and his wife take in to earn money.</p>
<p>He has not been able to get a pension as yet, because it<lb/>
seemed that he fully recovered from the yellow fever.</p>
<p>It seems so sad, and I felt that I wanted to tell you<lb/>
about his condition.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Respectfully yours,</salute>
<signed>(Signed) Jennie Wilson</signed>.
