Mr. M. D. Brewer<lb/>
Washington and Jefferson College<lb/>
Washington, Pa.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Brewer:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am a little disturbed about my missing photographs of Moran and<lb/>
Kissinger. Perhaps I should be sending this letter to Dr. Hutchison rather<lb/>
than to you, but I am sending a carbon copy to him and Miss Hough. It was<lb/>
my distinct recollection that I had included, with the various other photographs,<lb/>
my own autographed photos of Moran and Kissinger. When I was in Washington, I<lb/>
mentioned this to Miss Hough. She hesitated a moment and then said, &ldquo;Yes, I<lb/>
believe they are in the folder with the other photographs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After receiving your letter yesterday, last night I looked through all<lb/>
my photographs and correspondence. I found the two empty folders in which I had<lb/>
had the photographs and found a memorandum with the empty folders which read, &ldquo;My<lb/>
autographed photos of Moran and Kissinger sent to Dr. Hutchison.&rdquo; My secretary<lb/>
has a copy of the letter sent to Dr. Hutchison, under the date of October 5, at<lb/>
which time I sent him the various photographs which you returned to me, and the<lb/>
following paragraph:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enclose with them a photograph of Moran and one of Kissinger, made out<lb/>
to me. But the autographs are such that they will not interfere with your publicity<lb/>
purposes..... I am very proud of the ones of Moran and Kissinger to me, and I sin-<lb/>
cerely hope you will ask your photographer to take special care of them and if<lb/>
possible, return not only them but also the others, or save them until I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore, I am afraid the burden of proof is on you, as they were all<lb/>
sent together. I am sure you will find them. You may have, in the meantime,<lb/>
received ones directly from Moran and Kissinger, and used them. Therefore, I<lb/>
suspect that my photographs are still somewhere in Dr. Hutchison's office. Naturally,<lb/>
I am anxious not to have them lost, but fortunately, as the two men are still living,<lb/>
if they are lost, it isn't irreparable, but I would be a little embarrassed to write<lb/>
and ask them for another until more of a search has been made for them.</p>
<p>Thank you very kindly for your promise to send me copies of the additional<lb/>
photographs taken by another photographer. I shall be very glad to have them. I<lb/>
shall also be very glad to see the souvenir booklet which you are making. I am sure<lb/>
it will be very nice. If possible, I should like to have a dozen copies, to place<lb/>
in the hands of the people who have been helping me in my historical researches.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
