<salute>Dear Dr. Carter-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Christmas here again<lb/>
and how are you. How often during<lb/>
the year Bob and I have thought<lb/>
of you and spoken of you and hoped<lb/>
that you were better. It is wonderful<lb/>
that you have been able to do so<lb/>
much, even though often in pain. Bob<lb/>
was most interested in all the<lb/>
special work and writing you have<lb/>
been doing. If you have been able to<lb/>
add to the book I know you will<lb/>
feel more satisfied but it must be<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01217021"/>
particularly hard to want to do so<lb/>
much when you know that rest is<lb/>
imperative and essential. We were so<lb/>
very glad to get your letter. I am<lb/>
afraid though that it was a great<lb/>
effort to write 'and it would be better<lb/>
for you not to attempt to answer<lb/>
this. Laura will perhaps send us<lb/>
a few lines after Christmas, with a<lb/>
few messages from you, and just<lb/>
let us know how you are.</p>
<p>We seem fairly content at the end<lb/>
of our second year in South Bend.<lb/>
Bob has been practising by himself<lb/>
this past year - which is better in<lb/>
every way. He has a tidy practice<lb/>
and is well liked but the industrial<lb/>

depression everywhere has made it rather<lb/>
bad for doctors. Especially here, where<lb/>
the entire population is dependent upon<lb/>
the various industries the financial<lb/>
slump has been very marked. Studebakers<lb/>
Oliver Ploughs. Singer Sewing Machines &amp;<lb/>
Wilson Shirts - all have huge plants and<lb/>
were all closed at once. We never<lb/>
knew by whistles, when it might be<lb/>
Seven a.m. We are hoping for this<lb/>
coming year to be better and in the<lb/>
meantime, though I am chief cook and<lb/>
bottle washer, I am getting fat on the<lb/>
job and only bewail the fact that I<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01217023"/>
have so little time to feed my poor<lb/>
dusty brain. In as much as my mother<lb/>
learned to speak French &amp; German after<lb/>
she was fifty, there may yet be time<lb/>
for me.</p>
<p>Your little Gwenyth is well - big<lb/>
Gwenyth I should say, for she grows so<lb/>
tall and slim. She is pale and has no<lb/>
great resistance but manages to hold<lb/>
her own. She is wonderfully advanced<lb/>
at school in all subjects, and even<lb/>
skipped most of her second grade so<lb/>
that she is now in the last half of<lb/>
third grade and only 7 1/2 yrs old. She<lb/>
remembers long verses of poetry in a<lb/>
most astounding way. Young Bobbie is<lb/>
a bundle of health and high spirits<lb/>

does not know any of his A. B. C's &amp;<lb/>
thinks only of trains &amp; autos, and things<lb/>
he can do with his hands.</p>
<p>We often wish we could come to<lb/>
see you but our hands seem to be tied.<lb/>
We were glad to have news of the<lb/>
<unclear>Derivaux</unclear> and also of Dr. <unclear>Luizon</unclear> whom<lb/>
Bob knows quite well.</p>
<p>I hope your Christmas will be a<lb/>
happy one, and the coming year kind<lb/>
to you. We send our best wishes to<lb/>
Laura too and thank her for so kindly<lb/>
sending your letters to us.</p>
<p>Gwenyth sends<lb/>
her love to<lb/>
