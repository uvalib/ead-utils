Senor Adrian Macia<lb/>
Manzana de Gomez 325<lb/>
Havana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Senor Macia:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciate greatly your letter of January 6 which arrived just<lb/>
before I went East for two weeks in Washington. I appreciate the answers to my<lb/>
questions and am enclosing a check for $150.00 to purchase 150 square yards of<lb/>
land as per your letter of January 6. I assume, of course, that this land com-<lb/>
prises the land now occupied by the little shack (Building No. 1). I also appre-<lb/>
ciate that this isn't a very large amount of land and wondered how near it comes<lb/>
to the former site of Building No. 2, where we saw the remains of the concrete<lb/>
floor. I am anxious to obtain legal possession of at least enough of this land<lb/>
to preserve our little building. Because of the war it may be more difficult<lb/>
to accomplish rapidly our complete purpose in raising the money for this memorial<lb/>
but I am anxious to protect it against further encroachment of the quarry, etc.<lb/>
and most sincerely appreciate your real and personal interest in this venture.<lb/>
I would appreciate it if you would discuss the matter further with your partners<lb/>
so that we can know whether they would be willing to join you in presenting more<lb/>
of the site of Camp Lazear for our project.</p>
<p>All he<lb/>
woned<lb/>
tell me<lb/>
now.</p>
<p>I am surprised to hear that nothing has been done to the house.<lb/>
Some months ago I sent Mr. Moran a check for $50.00 with which he was going to have<lb/>
some repairs done to the porch and roof. The check has been cashed and returned<lb/>
but perhaps he has been ill or has had difficulty in arranging this. I plan to<lb/>
write him. I appreciate your estimate of the cost of the materials to build the<lb/>
type of memorial building I had in mind, and as soon as you can give me information<lb/>
as to the cost of the land I will be able to present a more formal program to those<lb/>
of my friends who are interested in this project. May I hope, therefore, that you<lb/>
will write to me shortly about this?</p>
<p>I have just received a letter from Dr. Felipe Carbonell Ponce of<lb/>
Havana. He noted my paper on &ldquo;Conquerors of Yellow Fever&rdquo; in the Proceedings of<lb/>
the Mayo Clinic Staff Meetings, a copy of which I enclose. This inspired him to<lb/>
get in touch with Mr. Salas who apparently owns a Havana radio station, and he and<lb/>
Mr. Salas as I understand it interviewed President Batista and Dr. Marruz, acting<lb/>
Minister of Health, proposing that the Cuban government become interested in this<lb/>
venture. Just how far they have got or will get, I have no knowledge. I shall be<lb/>
very grateful to you if you would give me your confidential opinion regarding Dr.<lb/>
Ponce, whether he is an outstanding Havana physician of the high type which we would<lb/>
want to be associated with this venture. Knowing how tentative government projects<lb/>
in our own country are so long delayed in passage and accomplishment I do not wish<lb/>
to rely too greatly on the efforts of Dr. Ponce and wish to go ahead with my<lb/>
arrangements with you and with our arrangements here. If, happily, Dr. Ponce should<lb/>
really interest the Cuban government in our project, I can assure you it would give<lb/>
me great pleasure to hand over any ideas and property which I might have and in the<lb/>
meantime might obtain from you. It would be the greatest pleasure to hand to the<lb/>
Cuban government gratis any interest I have in the project but I do want to see that<lb/>
it is put through properly for all concerned.</p>
