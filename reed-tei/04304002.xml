<salute>My dear Johnny:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Since dictating the enclosed letter, I have been to New York and back<lb/>
and I have talked to the head of our Editorial Department. We are most anxious<lb/>
to help you in any way possible. Doctor Hewitt of our Editorial Department is<lb/>
also greatly worried because there is only one copy of your manuscript. He thinks<lb/>
that you should have a copy made out and deposit it with trusted friends who will<lb/>
only use it as you wish. Such things as fires, and tornadoes do occur. People<lb/>
get sick and relatives come in and throw things away, etc., etc.</p>
<p>I should like to make you a proposition. If you are willing to send<lb/>
your manuscript here, registered mail, we have a copying machine here that makes<lb/>
not photostats, but what we call dry <unclear>amoniated</unclear> prints quite inexpensively and<lb/>
effectively. We could make you two or three copies at no expense to you; if you<lb/>
would continue to honor me by your confidence, I would keep one here to use only<lb/>
as and when you wish and I could return the original and other copies to you,<lb/>
one of which could be kept in your home, the others could be kept in your safe<lb/>
deposit box. On the basis of the one you would allow me to keep, you and I could<lb/>
have further friendly correspondence and if correspondence would bother you, I<lb/>
could compare it with the notes I already have and perhaps make a questionnaire<lb/>
which we could discuss easily and leisurely on my next visit to Cuba.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to send it here, may I urgently and earnestly make<lb/>
a second proposition. Will you ask a stenographer to make two or three copies<lb/>
of your manuscript <hi>at my expense</hi> or have your manuscript photostated <hi>at my expense</hi>,<lb/>
sending me the negative photostats. We could have the positive photostats<lb/>
made here.</p>
<p>All of the above is just an indication of how valuable your friends<lb/>
know your manuscript is.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
