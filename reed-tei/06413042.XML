<title>Letter from Albert E. Truby to Jefferson Randolph Kean, March 29, 1947</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Truby asserts that Reed knew of Carter's and Finlay's theories long before Lazear. Consequently, Reed was the real pioneer in the mosquito theory, not Lazear. Truby is concerned that Hench supports Lazear as being the mosquito theory proponent instead of Reed.</p>

<salute>Dear General Kean-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I <unclear>thoroughly</unclear> enjoyed your<lb/>
letter of Feb. 22 and wanted to write<lb/>
you at once, but at that time I was<lb/>
in the midst of answering three long<lb/>
questionaires from Hench and could not<lb/>
take on any more work. I <unclear>thoroughly</unclear><lb/>
enjoyed the work and was most agree-<lb/>
ably surprised by some of the new<lb/>
things he had unearthed which refute<lb/>
that rascal Lambert about some of the<lb/>
things he recently told Hench about the YF-<lb/>
huts. Back in '38 he tried to tell me the<lb/>
truth, but when he found that I did<lb/>
not recommend Ames &amp; himself for<lb/>
the medal of Honor (in my book), he promptly<lb/>
changed his story for the purpose of<lb/>
discrediting me in Dr. Hench's mind<lb/>
I am sure, I have asked Dr. H.<lb/>
to let you see my answers. I am sure<lb/>
you would get a real kick out of some<lb/>
of them. For example, I am sure that<lb/>
Reed, the mature teacher, knew about<lb/>
Carter's findings before Lazear ever heard<lb/>
of them, and I am just as certain that<lb/>
they impressed Reed more in favor of Finlay's<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06413043"/>
<add>theory</add> than they did Lazear at first. I am just<lb/>
as confidant that Reed knew about Finlay's<lb/>
theory long before Lazear did. I rather<lb/>
think you will agree with my arguments<lb/>
if you see them. Hench has had the idea<lb/>
since he first started this study that<lb/>
Lazear was the real leader in the mosquito<lb/>
theory. Of course <hi>he was not</hi>, but he was<lb/>
a bright hard worker, and soon became<lb/>
a leader as Reed had given him the<lb/>
work that was bound to bring results.</p>
<p>I have just heard from Hench, but he<lb/>
is so busy with his other work, lectures<lb/>
and traveling that he has barely had time<lb/>
to scan the things I sent him. So his<lb/>
real reaction to my remarks will come<lb/>
later.</p>
<p>I was so glad to hear about &ldquo;Dusty&rdquo;<lb/>
and the way he was picking up when you<lb/>
wrote. We had had a letter earlier from<lb/>
Mrs. Siler and it was retty gloomy. I<lb/>
did not think that &ldquo;Dusty&rdquo; was a good<lb/>
surgical risk and I thought his chances<lb/>
very poor, but thank God he fooled me.</p>
<p>We are still hopeful of seeing you<lb/>
in May. The Pullman's are still congested<lb/>
and R.R. conditions not too good. &ldquo;My tongue<lb/>
is hanging out&rdquo; for <hi>one</hi> good drink of<lb/>
that &ldquo;bottled-in-bond&rdquo; you have promised me.</p>
<p>All is well with the Trubys and we all<lb/>
join in cordial regards to you &amp; Mrs. Kean</p>

<salute>Affectionately yours</salute>
