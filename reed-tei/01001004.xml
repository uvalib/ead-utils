Miss Florence M. Read,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary,<lb/>
International Health Board,<lb/>
61 Broadway, New York, N. Y.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Miss Read:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In answer to your letter of September 5th., stating that Connor<lb/>
would like to have a criticism on certain articles he had written, I<lb/>
would say:</p>
<p>1/ I wrote him, at his request, a very full criticism on &ldquo;Stego-<lb/>
myia Indices and Their Value&rdquo; prior to its publication.</p>
<p>I have never received the &ldquo;Preliminary and Final Report on Merida,&rdquo;<lb/>
which I would be glad to have, nor the &ldquo;Notes on the Use of Fresh Water<lb/>
Fish as Consumers of Mosquito&rdquo; etc., although I have one piece of his,<lb/>
&ldquo;Fish as Mosquito Destroyers,&rdquo; reprinted from Natural History, No. 3, 1921.</p>
<p>His &ldquo;Notes on Yellow Fever in Mexico&rdquo; I received while at Geddes.<lb/>
I acknowledged its receipt, but gave no detailed criticism thereof, ex-<lb/>
cept simply to commend the paper, which it well deserved. I think I put<lb/>
a Memorandum in a letter to Dr. Rose, stating that this was an excellent<lb/>
paper.</p>
<p>a/ He makes only one statement of fact that I would question<lb/>
(Page 4) &ldquo;The campaign in Cuba extended over a period of 18 months be-<lb/>
fore it was decided that the fever had been eliminated.&rdquo; This campaign<lb/>
was begun February 1901: I don't know when it was <hi>decided</hi> that the in-<lb/>
fection was eliminated, but the last case reported occurred September of<lb/>
the same year. It is questionable if the case at Colon of May 1906 was<lb/>
yellow fever, but it was so reported (for executive purposes.) I am quite<lb/>
sure that it was not</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01001005"/>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>b/ On Page 5, in two places, &ldquo;critical period&rdquo; is used where he<lb/>
clearly intended to use &ldquo;critical number.&rdquo; This is merely a verbal in-<lb/>
advertance.</p>
<p>On the same page he implies he does not quite understand what I<lb/>
mean by the term &ldquo;critical number.&rdquo; An examination of any of the articles<lb/>
in which it is defined (as &ldquo;The Mechanism of the Spontaneous Elimination<lb/>
of Yellow Fever,&rdquo; Annals Tropical Medicine and Parisitology. March 15/20) <del>.</del><lb/>
would, I think, clear this up. This is not, however, a matter of any im-<lb/>
portance so far as this paper is concerned.</p>
<p>c) One may question the implied assumption, made here, that because<lb/>
a Stegomyia breeding (of depositos) of 10% had proved to be a &ldquo;safety in-<lb/>
dex&rdquo; for Guayaquil in 1919 it would be the same for all other places.</p>
<p>A town with a decidedly larger percentage of susceptible people<lb/>
than Guayaquil then had would require a greater reduction of Stegomyia to<lb/>
eliminate yellow fever than Guayaquil then did. In one with a much less<lb/>
percentage of susceptible people a less reduction would suffice to do so.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the index of breeding (house or depositos)<lb/>
with unprotected depositos, is a fair measure of the number of (female) im-<lb/>
agoes in flight and hence measures the risk of occurrence of yellow fever,<lb/>
while, as Connor has well brought in his paper on Stegomyia Indices etc.,<lb/>
the efficacy of our work in the control of yellow fever is measured, in-<lb/>
versely, by the <hi>production of imagoes</hi>, which is taking place, which may<lb/>
bear no relation to the amount of breeding.</p>
<p>d) The paper as a whole is good--very good. The part on Pages 1 and 2,<lb/>
and in some other places, distinguishing between areas of &ldquo;permanent en-<lb/>
demicity&rdquo; and foci not permanently endemic in such areas is true and well<lb/>
expressed.</p>
<p>e) His discussion of &ldquo;hacienda endemicity&rdquo; (Pages 3 and 4) is also in-<lb/>
teresting. Less clear than the above.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f01001006"/>
<p>above.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>f Absolutely true is his statement of the relation of yellow fever<lb/>
to the commercial history of the area and places in question, as is his com-<lb/>
parison of the relative efficiency of adult immigrants and babies born in<lb/>
the place in continuing infection in any locality. <add>It is less clear than he could make it</add>. It is questionable,<lb/>
however, if his explanation of the diminution of infant mortality fol-<lb/>
lowing the use of fish in the water containers would be accepted by a<lb/>
number of tropical sanitarians--e. g. Juan Guiteras or old Chaille, if he<lb/>
were alive. The absence of report of yellow fever among native children<lb/>
is not proof that none is occurring.</p>
<p>g) I think too his explanation of the increase of Stegomyia produc-<lb/>
tion during the early days of the rainy season is correct, although it<lb/>
is one I have not thought of before.</p>
<p>h) His recommendation for fish in Stegomyia control, although strong,<lb/>
is not by any means too strong. As you know, to him we owe the use of<lb/>
fish for this purpose in our recent yellow fever campaigns.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
