Maj. J.R. Kean, U.S.A.,<lb/>
Surgeon-General's Office, War Department,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Kean:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Medical supplies<lb/>
from Army Depot-</p>
<p>Yours of June 14th received. The material arrived on the<lb/>
22nd, that is, about two weeks from the time the cable left here. This has<lb/>
taken the breath away from everybody, and we feel quite dazed yet.</p>
<p>Continue to ship as you have been.</p>
<p>It had been taking <unclear>to another</unclear><lb/>
under the Pub. Health <unclear>Ser.</unclear></p>
<p>The Governor intends to give us our stores, but the details<lb/>
of the change will not be made until the Auditor arrives. I have written<lb/>
Phillips to see Turrill about the X rays apparatus.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gorgas arrived safely and is looking better than she has for<lb/>
years.</p>
<p>Yellow fever is about as it was when you left, but our misfortunes<lb/>
are increased by the addition of a case of plague which developed in one<lb/>
of the long-shoremen living at LaBoca, June 20th; none since.</p>
<p>I try to keep the Governor cheerful by announcing every morning,<lb/>
first, that the Zone is entirely free from Cholera, second, from Small-pox,<lb/>
and then I go through with all the other infectious and contagious diseases,<lb/>
and wind up by mentioning, in an off-hand manner, that we have four or five<lb/>
cases of yellow fever and a case or two of plague. In this way I convey the<lb/>
impression that he ought to be very thankful for the many evils which<lb/>
he escapes.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06207002"/>
<p>2:-</p>
<p>It does not altogether work, but is the best I can do under the<lb/>
circumstances.</p>
<p>I think that we will get along first rate, though I cannot announce,<lb/>
as I usually do in my letters to you, that yellow fever is at present<lb/>
stamped out. Tell the General that I am much obliged for his faith on<lb/>
the subject. Of course I know that <unclear>yellow</unclear> fever and Gorgas cannot exist<lb/>
at the same place. The thing is to make people at large believe in the<lb/>
same way. I would be much obliged for any assistance the General can give<lb/>
me in convincing the Secretary and others that Gorgas and Yellow fever<lb/>
are incompatible.</p>
<p>Please remember me most cordially to Mrs. Kean, and believe me,<lb/>
as ever,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>W. C. Gorgas,<lb/>
Chief Sanitary Officer</signed>.
