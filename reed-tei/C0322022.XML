<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you very much indeed for your most interesting letter of<lb/>
June 25th. I greatly appreciate the data you gave me therein <hi>re</hi> things<lb/>
West African and am looking forward to reading the paper you mention as<lb/>
soon to be published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine.</p>
<p>I know you will be glad to hear that Miss Brown and I are progressing<lb/>
beyond what I had thought possible in so short a time. Last Saturday (a<lb/>
half holiday at the Library of Congress) she came back to my apartment with<lb/>
me and we worked until 10 P. M. going over one of our almost-completed files<lb/>
and making Memoranda of the things yet to be done to it. They were very<lb/>
few--and those mainly due to the fact that some of the books Father con-<lb/>
sulted are not on the shelves and are being searched. We shall spend our<lb/>
Fourth of July holiday going over the second almost-completed file--that<lb/>
on West Africa. Remains yet to be done the strictly medical bibliography:<lb/>
which will certainly in part have to be done at the Library of the Surgeon<lb/>
General of the Army. Miss Brown started <del>on it</del><add>checking the authors</add> last Sunday afternoon as<lb/>
we want to ascertain how many of the books, on purely medical subjects,<lb/>
are available to us at the Library of Congress. This because <add>I think that</add> it will be<lb/>
both <del><unclear>quci</unclear></del> quicker and less expensive to handle them where I now am--that is<lb/>
if I have to get someone at the S. G's Library in Miss Brown's place. Miss<lb/>
Brown has offered to take leave if necessary and go to the S. G's Library<lb/>
with me and has also said that if it were necessary for me to engage someone<lb/>
there more familiar with medical references than herself that she <add>would then</add> gladly<lb/>
give her services free. This, I am sure, you would not wish her to do, but<lb/>
it shows the spirit in which she is <del>d</del><add>h</add><unclear>a</unclear>ndling her part of the work.</p>
<p>Of course, what is left to be done on the two almost-completed files<lb/>
<unclear>[unclear]</unclear> <add>done!</add> but I think that after the medical<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0322023"/>
medical<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
bibliography is cleared up, I can <add>(at least temporarily)</add> leave these unavoidable &ldquo;loose-ends&rdquo; <del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del><lb/>
<del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del><lb/>
and go over to work with Dr. Frost in Baltimore, which will really be<lb/>
&ldquo;the beginning of the end.&rdquo; Also, if the medical bibliography goes any-<lb/>
where near so well as the other has, I should be able to make the move<lb/>
by the early part of August--possibly sooner: it will depend upon the<lb/>
facilities available for long hard work, at a new place. These I shall<lb/>
investigate as soon as Miss Brown has gotten a &ldquo;line&rdquo; on what books and<lb/>
<add>medical journals</add> will have to be verified away from the Library of Congress. I am sure <unclear>th</unclear><lb/>
there is no more delightful place to work than the Library of the Surgeon<lb/>
General of the Army, but whether one can remain after 4.30 (Government<lb/>
closing time) etc. I have yet to discover<del>,</del><unclear>with</unclear> the exception of Satur-<lb/>
day afternoons in the summer: the Fourth of July and Christmas, one can<lb/>
work at the Library of Congress until 10 P. M.--Sundays included.</p>
<closer>
<salute>With very best remembrances, I remain<lb/>
Most truly yours,</salute>
