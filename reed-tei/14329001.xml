<salute>Dear mother-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was very glad<lb/>
to get your long letter<lb/>
of Nov. 27 &amp; 30, and hear<lb/>
such good news of all<lb/>
the family. I hope Peg<lb/>
has had a fine time<lb/>
at Philadelphia, so as<lb/>
to make up for not<lb/>
going to the <unclear>Weeds.</unclear></p>
<p>Rannie and I were<lb/>
very much relieved to<lb/>
know that you would<lb/>
meet Mama in New York<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14329002"/>
and Capt. Balmer wrote<lb/>
that he would see<lb/>
she had a nice room<lb/>
so we feel that she<lb/>
was started off all<lb/>
right. They should reach<lb/>
Matanzas today. I am<lb/>
afraid the voyage has<lb/>
been a rough one, for<lb/>
we have had nearly<lb/>
a week of windy rainy<lb/>
weather, and we read<lb/>
dreadful things of the<lb/>
storms in New England<lb/>
and New York. I hope<lb/>
you and the family<lb/>
weathered it safely.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f14329003"/>
<p>Mrs. Stark and I are greatly excited<lb/>
over the coming of the Xmas box we<lb/>
expect to have most of our fun when<lb/>
we open it, and we are wondering<lb/>
where we can conceal the things<lb/>
until Xmas day.</p>
<p>Friday night our mess gave a<lb/>
dinner. Our guests were the Baldwins<lb/>
Dunns and Starks. Rufinia is cook-<lb/>
ing very well this year, so with<lb/>
some help from Mrs. Slocum and myself<lb/>
she got up a very nice dinner. Helen<lb/>
needn't sniff at our mess for it is<lb/>
a very nice one. Mrs. Slocum and I<lb/>
get on together most beautifully. I really<lb/>
like her, the Captain Tambieu, Col. Burton<lb/>
and Major Rolfe are very nice mess-<lb/>
mates. They are all so appreciative it<lb/>
makes the running of the mess much<lb/>
easier than it was last year. Mrs.<lb/>
Slocum and I are speculating as to<lb/>
what the Burton family will be like<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14329004"/>
when they become a part<lb/>
of a big family. I guess,<lb/>
between us tho we can<lb/>
keep them in order and<lb/>
smoothed the right way.</p>
<p>I wish you could<lb/>
see Martha ride with<lb/>
Capt. Slocum's orderly.<lb/>
He on one horse she on<lb/>
another. She has been<lb/>
over to the Palace and<lb/>
back twice now and<lb/>
she begs rides from all<lb/>
the men who come a-<lb/>
round here with horses.<lb/>
They are all very sweet<lb/>
to her and walk up<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14329005"/>
and down with her when-<lb/>
ever they can, and once<lb/>
and a while Looney,<lb/>
(Capt. Slocum's man)<lb/>
will bring over a horse<lb/>
especially for her and<lb/>
then they ride together,<lb/>
which delights Martha.<lb/>
She says she is &ldquo;just<lb/>
like a young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs is simply dear,<lb/>
and seems to thrive<lb/>
and grow fat in<lb/>
spite of the <del>gla</del> gales<lb/>
that whistle around<lb/>
his head both day<lb/>
and night. Columbia<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14329006"/>
is just as windy as ever, and<lb/>
the breezes blow not only through the<lb/>
windows, but under the doors and<lb/>
up through the floor. However we are<lb/>
all well and don't have any colds.</p>
<p>Rannie is now boning as hard as<lb/>
he can for his examination, for,<lb/>
even if the army bill does not go<lb/>
through he is very near his promotion.</p>
<p>There has been great excitement today<lb/>
among the doctors, for the first case<lb/>
of fever at the experimental camp<lb/>
(Camp Lazear) occured today. For eight<lb/>
days the volunteers have been sleeping<lb/>
with infected bedding, blankets etc.<lb/>
and &ldquo;nothing doing&rdquo;, but four days<lb/>
ago, in another house, a man who<lb/>
had been under observation for three<lb/>
weeks was bitten by some &ldquo;loaded&rdquo;<lb/>
mosquitoes and now has fever. Dr.<lb/>
Reed declared he is going off on<lb/>
the &ldquo;toot&rdquo; of his life, and Rannie is<lb/>
nearly as excited as Dr. Reed.</p>
<p>Love to all,</p>
<closer>
<salute>affectionately,</salute>
<signed>Louise.</signed>
