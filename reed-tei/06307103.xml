<title>Letter from Albert E. Truby to Philip Showalter Hench, November 30, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Truby comments on the notebook found at the New York Academy, stating that it could be Lazear's record from the laboratory. He knows the Board went to see Finlay in early July, and that they started to raise mosquitoes at once, because he saw them in glass jars. As such, he disputes Agramonte's date for the beginning of the mosquito work. Truby believes it was Lazear, not Agramonte, who induced Reed to meet with Finlay.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>

</opener>
<p>I am most excited and thrilled over<lb/>
the news in your letter (Special Delivery) which<lb/>
came at 5. P. M. yesterday- That may be<lb/>
Lazear's record at the laboratory which<lb/>
I referred to in my MMS- Will inclose<lb/>
my original remarks in that <hi>famous</hi> first<lb/>
rough draft, and have underline with<lb/>
a blue pencil the important parts. Please<lb/>
return those three pages for the old book-</p>
<p>I could not possibly give any<lb/>
idea of the size of the <hi>pocket</hi> note<lb/>
book. But I am sure of one thing that<lb/>
the book in the N. Y. Academy could not<lb/>
be the one- I can recall nothing about<lb/>
the larger book except Reed did find<lb/>
a record of the laboratory mosquitoes-<lb/>
whether it was in a book or on<lb/>
slips of paper I do not know - quite<lb/>
naturally they would be kept in a book.<lb/>
The new book may disclose many<lb/>
things of importance- The start of mosquito<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06307104"/>
2<lb/>
raising in the lab- for instance- It<lb/>
may also tell when the Board went to<lb/>
see Finlay and brought back larvae and<lb/>
mosq. eggs- I have repeatedly told you<lb/>
that they want to see Finlay early in<lb/>
July and that they started to raise mosquitoes<lb/>
at once- I know that this is so far<lb/>
I saw the lab, glass jars with mosquitoes<lb/>
in then when Durham &amp; Myers were<lb/>
there, and they saw them too- Pinto<lb/>
confirms this- You continue to quote<lb/>
Agramonte's statement, &ldquo;Aug 1,&rdquo; as the<lb/>
start of that work. On this point I<lb/>
also think that it was Lazear and not<lb/>
Agramonte who induced Reed to see<lb/>
Finlay <del>early</del><add>soon</add> after the Board organized.<lb/>
Agramonte had no more use for<lb/>
Finlay's theory then any <add>of the</add> other Cuban doctors,<lb/>
and I doubt if he proposed the visit-<lb/>
Sternberg had told Reed to investigate<lb/>
There is a record of this published somewhere, will put it in the book if I find it-<lb/>
the insect theories and on Reed's visit <add>to us</add> at<lb/>
an earlier date he discussed Finlay's<lb/>
theory on our porch- Reed therefore<lb/>
may have proposed the trip himself-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06307105"/>
3<lb/>
I am sure that these things will clean<lb/>
up in time, but please be cautions about<lb/>
quoting Agramonte too freely without qualifing<lb/>
in some way- He is positively wrong<lb/>
about Aug 1-</p>
<p>___________________</p>
<p>I am anxious to hear more about the new<lb/>
book so dont keep me in suspense when you<lb/>
get the info- Col Mahlon Ashford Md. Corps, Retired, is,<lb/>
I think, still the Secretary of the NYC Academy and<lb/>
probably has charge of the library. He will be glad<lb/>
to corporate with you- He is one of the officers who<lb/>
persistantly <hi>urged me to</hi> write of the story-</p>
<p>You may use my photographs in any way you<lb/>
like. Later on I will send you more and<lb/>
the films (originals) also.</p>
<p>I would be delighted to have more of the<lb/>
reprints and also some of those in the Wyeth ad-<lb/>
in the Journal AMA. Kean's idea is fine-</p>
<p>I think that the <unclear>Daugherty</unclear> wagon was<lb/>
devised by a Col of that name but I really<lb/>
dont know for sure. The <unclear>I. M. Q. O.</unclear> could tell you-<lb/>
will return your photograph at a later date</p>
<p>Thanks for the data on the English losses<lb/>
from the &ldquo;Vomito&rdquo; in <del>the</del> 1780- I found my<lb/>
source of info. re. that in Havard's Hygiene 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Edition<lb/>
1917. P. 73.</p>
<p>Isn't this all exciting? I got a great<lb/>
kick out of it all.</p>
