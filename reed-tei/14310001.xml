<salute>Dearest mother.</salute>
</opener>
<p>It seems perfect<lb/>
ages since you and the<lb/>
girls left. Martha and I<lb/>
have been trying to settle<lb/>
down to our ways of<lb/>
long ago, but it is very<lb/>
hard, the amusing<lb/>
aunts having been with<lb/>
us so long.</p>
<p>I found out Saturday the<lb/>

Sedgewick had finally<lb/>
gone to Gibara, so I sup-<lb/>
pose you cannot get to<lb/>
New York before Thursday.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14310002"/>
I hope you were not<lb/>
frightened by all the<lb/>
fighting you saw before<lb/>
you left the harbor.<lb/>
I saw Mr. Eaton Sunday,<lb/>
but, of course he had<lb/>
only noticed how <unclear>Eve</unclear><lb/>
was affected. Caz I have<lb/>
not seen. I hope the<lb/>
shock of finding that<lb/>
you went to Gibara,<lb/>
and so delayed the<lb/>
first letter, was not<lb/>
too much for him.<lb/>
Did you suffer from the<lb/>
heat on your way a-<lb/>
long the coast? The<lb/>
south wind has kept<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14310003"/>
us all very uncomfortable, until this<lb/>
morning, when the rain came, and<lb/>
now it is very cool and damp, but a<lb/>
great relief from the closeness of the<lb/>
last four days.</p>
<p>I have just finished Martha's three<lb/>
khaki uniforms, and they are <hi>very</hi><lb/>
becoming. I send you the pattern in<lb/>
another envelope, likewise the night-<lb/>
gown one. You remember you were<lb/>
to buy a piece of <unclear>rainsook</unclear> to make<lb/>
them of, and the embroidery for <unclear>trimming</unclear><lb/>
as well. Won't you please buy me<lb/>
an Easter egg for Martha, tho' I<lb/>
can't send any money until next<lb/>
week. I think she would love a<lb/>
rabbit, for Helen's story of the two<lb/>
little bunnies named Dot and Tot<lb/>
<del><unclear>too</unclear></del> made a great impression on her,<lb/>
and she talks of them all the time.<lb/>
I think you had better get something<lb/>
small enough to come by mail.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14310004"/>
And, if you can, will<lb/>
you send Rannie's<lb/>
headquarter star in<lb/>
time for Easter? I don't<lb/>
want to hurry you<lb/>
Mumsie, but, when you<lb/>
were here, Easter seemed<lb/>
so far away, and now<lb/>
that I have had to<lb/>
go back to letter writ-<lb/>
ing again, it seems to<lb/>
be drawing near very<lb/>
rapidly.</p>
<p>Last night Rannie and<lb/>
I walked over to the<lb/>
hospital to see Dr.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14310005"/>
Reed, who was spend-<lb/>
ing the night there.<lb/>
He was as lovely as<lb/>
ever, and unfortunately<lb/>
expects to leave on Sat-<lb/>
urday, on the last Tam-<lb/>
pa boat, so I am afraid<lb/>
we wont be able to<lb/>
have even a short vis-<lb/>
it from him. We sent<lb/>
you the Havana Herald<lb/>
with something about<lb/>
Electrozone and something<lb/>
about Dady in it.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Lee has been<lb/>
just the same since<lb/>
you left. First she has<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14310006"/>
asthma, then bronchitis and then both<lb/>
at once. She being so wretched and<lb/>
Ellen looking so dreadfully, I am<lb/>
afraid may make them leave earlier<lb/>
than they had planned and, of course,<lb/>
that will affect me. No orders yet<lb/>
tho', so we know no more than<lb/>
we did when you were here.</p>
<p>Sunday there was a big political<lb/>
meeting in Marianao, what we would<lb/>
call a primary I think, its sentiments<lb/>
were in opposition to the present al-<lb/>
calde, so he had the chairman ar-<lb/>
rested, and when another <add>was</add> elected and<lb/>
the tone of the meeting was not<lb/>
changed he had six or eight of the<lb/>
leading citizens who were present,<lb/>
arrested and put in the jail. Their<lb/>
friends rushed off to General Lee,<lb/>
who told them his only duty was<lb/>
to keep the peace and they would<lb/>
have to run their own politics. I<lb/>
believe tho' he had a judge dragged<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f14310007"/>
<hi>3</hi><lb/>
out, for these men to<lb/>
appear before, and I<lb/>
think they were re-<lb/>
leased that night. We<lb/>
have heard, and I am<lb/>
sure it is true, that<lb/>
the civil governor of<lb/>
the province has sent<lb/>
the alcalde a list of<lb/>
people he is to keep<lb/>
his eye on, as they be-<lb/>
long to the other party,<lb/>
and the alcalde thought<lb/>
he was doing a fine<lb/>
job when he clapped<lb/>
them in prison so<lb/>
early in the game, tho'<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f14310008"/>
they are really the -<lb/>
best men in town.<lb/>
What queer ideas Cub-<lb/>
anos have, haven't they?</p>
<p>Miss Egan is still<lb/>
with us, but will leave<lb/>
Friday for Key West.</p>
<p>It is high time for<lb/>
<unclear>me</unclear> to dress for dinner<lb/>
and get Martha to<lb/>
bed, so I must say<lb/>
goodnight. I forgot<lb/>
to tell you that on<lb/>
Sunday Rannie really<lb/>
and finally cut the<lb/>
two <unclear>wevs</unclear> out of my<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f14310009"/>
head. They were very tiny, so not<lb/>
much trouble, and I have not be<lb/>
conscious of the cuts at all except<lb/>
when I fix my hair, which I have<lb/>
to do in a very deft way.</p>
<p>Rannie dined with Mr. Eaton Sun-<lb/>
day night! but nothing happened.</p>
<p>Love to all the family, I am<lb/>
anxious to hear how you found<lb/>
them and how you are. Martha<lb/>
says to give her love to Gran and<lb/>
to say she is going to see her<lb/>
very soon.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most lovingly</salute>

Poor Col. Wood fell on the marble<lb/>
steps the other night and broke<lb/>
his right arm at the wrist.<lb/>
