<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>We were glad to be able to send your friend,<lb/>
Dr. Darrell Crain, in Washington, D.C. one of our framed<lb/>
prints of &ldquo;Conquerors of Yellow Fever&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The trip to Seattle which I mentioned had to<lb/>
do with a product which a Seattle group are interested in<lb/>
selling. As a specialist in arthritis you probably have a<lb/>
greater than average interest in calcium metabolism. The<lb/>
product just mentioned has been presented to us as a natural<lb/>
calcium solution (artesian well water) containing 1.38% cal-<lb/>
cium in the form of calcium chloride plus numerous mineral<lb/>
elements.</p>
<p>I was referred to a Dr. Alice Bernheim here in<lb/>
New York who was Sherman's assistant in the days when he was<lb/>
doing his work on calcium and who has published somewhat ex-<lb/>
tensively on the subject in the last twenty years. Dr. Bern-<lb/>
stein has been using the product experimentally and told me<lb/>
that it has the definite advantage of being better tolerated<lb/>
by most patients than any other form of calcium.</p>
<p>While the Calces group make quite a point of<lb/>
the trace elements included in the natural water our research<lb/>
staff feel that this is pure blue sky. Of course, it is poss-<lb/>
ible that the trace elements may have some bearing on the<lb/>
patients' ability to tolerate calcium chloride in solution.</p>
<p>If I should go to Seattle I would like to stop<lb/>
and talk to you and perhaps some of your associates who might<lb/>
be interested. Enclosed find a label from the Calces bottle<lb/>
along with a piece of their literature and a photostat of one<lb/>
of Dr. Bernstein's articles. This article was written, of<lb/>
course, before she had had any expxrience with the product<lb/>
under discussion.</p>
<p>As you know, we are always interested in new<lb/>
products. My interest in this one was aroused largely because<lb/>
of the fact that it might involve my making a trip to Seattle<lb/>
on the Company's money.</p>

<p>March 10, '42</p>
<p>Since that time I have become interested in calcium<lb/>
therapy.</p>
<p>Don't be surprised to find me headed in your direction<lb/>
either shortly before or shortly after your projected trip to<lb/>
Buffalo on March 28th.</p>
