<salute>My dear Gorgas:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I enclose you herewith copies of letter which I have re-<lb/>
ceived from Dr. Howard A. Kelly, and of my answer thereto.<lb/>
Should you wish to endorse my statements, or should you find any<lb/>
of them incorrect, I would thank you very much to write the fact,<lb/>
or facts, to Dr. Kelly. I should be sorry to see any incorrect<lb/>
reflections upon Dr. Guit&eacute;ras published.</p>
<p>I had a delightful letter from Aileen the other day,<lb/>
which I shall answer to-morrow.</p>
<p>Love to Marie, Aileen, the Carters and John,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Always faithfully your friend</salute>

<hi>NOTE</hi>
</opener>
<p>Having recently arrived (his third visit to Havana) Dr.<lb/>
Carroll evidently did not understand the status of the personnel<lb/>
of Las Animas Hospital. I was the director of said hospital,<lb/>
while Dr. Guit&eacute;ras was the chief of its laboratory, which included<lb/>
the mosquito work -- &ldquo;Inoculation Station&rdquo;. Consequently, I,<lb/>
and not Dr. Guiteras, was responsible for Dr. Carroll's diffi-<lb/>
culties in getting blood from the patients at Las Animas. It<lb/>
happened that the group of yellow-fever cases which we had there<lb/>
at the time were exceptionally severe ones. I explained to Dr.<lb/>
Carroll that each of these patients was too ill to safely under-<lb/>
go the excitement and fright (not to speak of the depletion)<lb/>
incident to the abstraction of several ounces of his blood, as<lb/>
proposed. I consulted Dr. Guit&eacute;ras, on account of his immense<lb/>
experience and extensive knowledge of yellow-fever: He entirely<lb/>
concurred in my opinion, That it is peculiarly dangerous to<lb/>
subject seriously-ill yellow-fever patients to the slightest<lb/>
shock or disturbance has long been known.</p>
<p>The vitally important facts, that yellow fever is trans-<lb/>
mitted to man by the mosquito, and by inoculation of blood dir-<lb/>
ectly from yellow-fever patients, as well as the impossibility<lb/>
of transmitting it by fomites, had already been conclusively<lb/>
demonstrated.</p>
<p>If Dr. Carroll had been in my place, and with my res-<lb/>
ponsibility, I believe he would have acted as I did.</p>
