<salute>Dear Dr Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your special delivery letter has<lb/>
just been delivered and I hasten to<lb/>
answer re, the two buildings at Camp<lb/>
Lazear. No, I did not see them in<lb/>
1906, as I was suddenly sent back<lb/>
to S.F. Prof. Guiteras gave a lecture<lb/>
on yellow fever in Havana for the<lb/>
benefit of the large number of Medical<lb/>
Officers who were there with troops in<lb/>
Oct. 1906. I think about 50 of us<lb/>
were present and, among other things,<lb/>
he <unclear>urged</unclear> every one of us to visit<lb/>
Camp Lazear, groups of Medical Officers<lb/>
did visit the place and <add>some of them</add> told me<lb/>
what they saw. I will try to verify<lb/>
that. <hi>zun zun equi told you the truth.</hi><lb/>
Both buildings were still there.</p>
<p>The large maps of Columbia Bks are here.<lb/>
I was much interested in the key. The hospital<lb/>
buildings were used for entirely different purposes<lb/>
<del>then</del> in 1907 than they were in 1900. Their problems<lb/>
were different<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06302041"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
and their medical personnel much larger.<lb/>
Hence almost every building, except the ward<lb/>
buildings, were used for quarters for the personnel.<lb/>
Reed's Lab. and even the morgue were used for<lb/>
quarters. Capt. Little M.C. lived in Lazear's house.<lb/>
&ldquo;Capt Truby&rdquo; was my cousin W.F. Truby.<lb/>
I lived at the post in quarters <hi>5</hi>with six<lb/>
other medical officers attached to my<lb/>
Company (Co. B. Hosp. Corps).</p>
<p>Will be glad to all the note book with<lb/>
photostatic articles. I think that I can<lb/>
give you some light on some of those things.<lb/>
Agramonte did <hi>not</hi> visit Lazear while he<lb/>
was sick and did not attend the funeral.<lb/>
This is of course confidential and I hope<lb/>
it can be explained by Agramontes being<lb/>
away from Havana at the time. This reminds<lb/>
me of <hi>Pinto </hi>again. Have you written to him?</p>
<p>I am very anxious to have him tell<lb/>
me just when he left Columbia Bks; and <lb/>
I am after his views on a few other<lb/>
things, but don't want to write him until<lb/>
after you hear from him. So please<lb/>
<hi>drop me a line on this before you<lb/>
sail for Cuba</hi>.</p>
<p>Give my best regards to Moran. I think that<lb/>
he feels that I am not friendly towards him.<lb/>
He is wrong about that if he feels that way.</p>

<salute>Very Sincerely</salute>
