<salute>Dear Col. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Becoming an author carries in<lb/>
its wake a whole lot of letter writing<lb/>
as I am just now experiencing- In<lb/>
this connection I want to thank you for the<lb/>
wonderful telegram you sent me about the<lb/>
book. Mrs. Truby and I both appreciates<lb/>
your very complimentary remarks. I have<lb/>
had nice letters from Mrs. Lazear, Mr. Kellogg,<lb/>
Gen Kean, Gen. Ireland and others. Even <unclear>Hosbins</unclear><lb/>
told me how pleased they are to include my book<lb/>
with their historical publications. My explanations<lb/>
to them about Laura Wood's book seems to have<lb/>
been satisfactory and so my mind was <unclear>relieved</unclear><lb/>
on that score. It had never occured to me<lb/>
to tell them that she was publishing a book on<lb/>
Walter Reed. So I have written her a nice<lb/>
letter, for her book is really a great addition<lb/>
to the very <unclear>major</unclear> literature on Reed's life.<lb/>
Her work is based on facts, very nicely<lb/>
written, and shows a vast amount of work on<lb/>
her part. I still feel, however that she<lb/>
should have told me before the book came<lb/>
out that it would soon appear, so that I could<lb/>
tell <unclear>Hosbins</unclear> and prepare them for the &ldquo;scoop&rdquo;-</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06401137"/>
<p>Ac<lb/>
T</p>
<p>I sent a copy of the book to Dr. Hewitt<lb/>
at the Mayo Clinic but Laura not heard<lb/>
from him. I wonder if he is away on<lb/>
was work also? Dr. <unclear>Fishbein</unclear> thanked me<lb/>
for his copy and said <del><unclear>that</unclear></del> that <unclear><del>a</del></unclear> review<lb/>
would soon appear in the Journal of the <unclear>A. M. C. O.</unclear><lb/>
I have no idea who will write it, but<lb/>
no doubt he will select someone competent<lb/>
to do it properly. I think that you will agree<lb/>
that it takes someone with a knowledge of <add>the</add> history<lb/>
of y. f. rather than a literary critic to do<lb/>
it justice.</p>
<p>I have been too busy to contact Mr <unclear>Robin</unclear><lb/>
Lampron but will do that, and other things<lb/>
I promised you, in due time. Am returning<lb/>
herewith the photo films you loaned me. <unclear>Thanks</unclear>.</p>
<p>Two of the y. f. Roll of Honor men have died<lb/>
recently - Clyde <del>Ford</del> West and England-</p>
<p>Kissinger &amp; his wife are at the State Soldiers Home<lb/>
in Ind. I sent them a book but I doubt if<lb/>
Kissinger condition will permit him to <unclear>get</unclear><lb/>
much and of it.</p>
<p>Tell me some news about yourself, the<lb/>
baby and your prospects of doing the experiments<lb/>
on rheumatism you mentioned.</p>
<p>With regards <unclear>&amp;</unclear> best wishes</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely,</salute>
