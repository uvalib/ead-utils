<p>The Mosquito Hypothesis.</p>
<p>Of all the silly and nonsensical rig-<lb/>
marole about yellow fever that has yet<lb/>
found its way into print--and there has<lb/>
been enough of it to load a fleet--the<lb/>
silliest beyond compare is to be found in<lb/>
the arguments and theories engendered by<lb/>
the mosquito hypothesis. Moreover, won-<lb/>
derful to relate, the climax of idiocy seems<lb/>
to have been reached in a dispatch to the<lb/>
New York Sun of the 1st of November<lb/>
from New Orleans. Evidently the Sun's<lb/>
press report must have been turned in by<lb/>
some one who has not lived in New Or-<lb/>
leans two consecutive years or who, if he<lb/>
has lived there at all, has never taken<lb/>
counsel of any well-informed person. Let<lb/>
us consider a specimen gem of thought<lb/>
from this amazing publication:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In past epidemics the piney woods of Louisiana<lb/>
and Mississippi, only a few miles from the coast,<lb/>
were considered a safe refuge from the fever, and<lb/>
it was attributed to the sanitary influence of the<lb/>
pines, without any good reason therefor. The fact<lb/>
that the mosquito is unknown in those woods, save<lb/>
in a few bottoms along the streams, would give a<lb/>
better explanation of the absence of the disease, or<lb/>
rather its failure to spread, even when persons<lb/>
already infected with the disease seek refuge among<lb/>
the pines. The report of the board of army medi-<lb/>
cal men explains what has heretofore been a mys-<lb/>
tery.&rdquo; ...</p>
<p>The last genuine epidemic of yellow<lb/>
fever in this country occurred in 1878,<lb/>
twenty-two years ago. Since then there<lb/>
have been some local visitations, here one<lb/>
year and there the next, but never gen-<lb/>
erally prevalent or in any proper sense of<lb/>
the word an epidemic. In 1878, however,<lb/>
the disease spread almost everywhere<lb/>
south of the Ohio River and west of the<lb/>
Appalachian range. Atlanta opened her<lb/>
gates to the afflicted fugitives, many of<lb/>
whom had the fever and either died or<lb/>
recovered in that city. The disease did not<lb/>
spread there at all. In other towns of the<lb/>
South it spread like wildfire. The town of<lb/>
Tangipahoa, about eighty-five miles north<lb/>
of New Orleans, was almost depopulated,<lb/>
yet it is situated in the typical piney<lb/>
woods and is not particularly long on<lb/>
mosquitoes. Fifteen miles south of Tan-<lb/>
gipahoa is Amite, lying on much lower<lb/>
ground and quite near to the great swamps<lb/>
which separate it from the river coast and<lb/>
the sugar belt. Amite maintained no<lb/>
quarantine. Communication with New Or-<lb/>
leans was practically uninterrupted. Mos-<lb/>
quitoes were in countless myriads in its<lb/>
immediate neighborhood. Yet Amite, with<lb/>
no quarantine and unlimited mosquitoes,<lb/>
went scot free, while Tangipahoa, in the<lb/>
sand hills and piney woods, with a shot-<lb/>
gun quarantine and a scant supply of<lb/>
mosquitoes, was a veritable shambles. Go-<lb/>
ing further north, into Mississippi, we find<lb/>
that the forlorn little railroad towns in<lb/>
the pine region were as mercilessly visited<lb/>
as the river towns, even in the alluvial<lb/>
region above Vicksburg. Holly Springs<lb/>
suffered perhaps more than Vicksburg and<lb/>
Greenville. The scourge went where it<lb/>
pleased, mosquitoes or no mosquitoes, pine<lb/>
ridge or swamp, and no human being<lb/>
knew then or knows now why or how it<lb/>
went. If it were a fact, which it is not,<lb/>
that &ldquo;the mosquito is unknown in those<lb/>
woods&rdquo; (the pine districts of Louisiana<lb/>
and Mississippi) this proposition might be<lb/>
entitled to respectful consideration. One<lb/>
might at least build upon it a reasonably<lb/>
specious theory. As things are, however,<lb/>
the &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; remains, notwithstanding<lb/>
this &ldquo;board of army medical men,&rdquo; who-<lb/>
ever they may be.</p>
<p>But the real bonne-bouche comes last:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The authorities in the piney woods towns also<lb/>
call attention to the remarkable fact that while ice<lb/>
will not kill the germ, as is shown by the reap-<lb/>
pearance of the disease after the bitter winter of<lb/>
1897, it (presumably the disease) disappears after<lb/>
a light frost. This can easily be explained by the<lb/>
mosquito theory, for the lightest frost kills off the<lb/>
mosquitoes, and the disease disappears simulta-<lb/>
neously with them.&rdquo; ...</p>
<p>No doubt this interesting postulate<lb/>
would attract attention were it based upon<lb/>
the very thinnest ground of fact, but the<lb/>
proposition &ldquo;that the lightest frost kills<lb/>
off the mosquitoes, and the disease disap-<lb/>
pears simultaneously with them,&rdquo; is so<lb/>
utterly preposterous as to forbid a serious<lb/>
thought. Any one who has lived in the<lb/>
far South--in what is known as the yel-<lb/>
low fever belt--knows that neither a<lb/>
light frost nor any other kind of a frost<lb/>
&ldquo;kills off the mosquitoes.&rdquo; Any one who<lb/>
has had experience of yellow fever along<lb/>
our Gulf coast knows that the only func-<lb/>
tion of a light frost is to make the disease<lb/>
more dangerous. In that region, where<lb/>
yellow fever is exotic, really cold weather<lb/>
invariably arrests an epidemic, but it does<lb/>
not harm the mosquito more than once in<lb/>
a century, and even then the pest lives in<lb/>
the dwellings and resumes business the<lb/>
moment the houses are heated for human<lb/>
occupation.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing in this mos-<lb/>
quito hypothesis as submitted to the New<lb/>
York Sun. It is not even comparable to<lb/>
the duster-broom-carbolic acid hypothe-<lb/>
sis, for thoroughly scientific sanitation at<lb/>
least alleviates some of the conditions<lb/>
which contribute to the success of Yellow<lb/>
Jack's assault.</p>
