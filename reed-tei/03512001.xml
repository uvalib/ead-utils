<p>Moran conveys news that Kean would be glad to collaborate with Hench in the yellow fever story. He suggests that Hench write to Kean, because Kean is the best authority on Walter Reed's work.</p>

{Gen. Kean's address}:<lb/>
Gen. Jefferson R. Kean,<lb/>
U. S. Army, Retired,<lb/>
2804 N Street, N. W.,<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
Havana, Cuba, <date value="1939-10-19">Oct. 19, 1939.</date>
</dateline>
Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
MAYO CLINIC,<lb/>
Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am happy to inform you that you can count on the whole-<lb/>
hearted cooperation of General Kean in connection with any article<lb/>
you may have in mind on &ldquo;The Conquest of Yellow Fever&rdquo;, having that<lb/>
assurance from the General in a letter I received from him some two<lb/>
weeks ago.</p>
<p>Although General Kean is now in his 80th year, his memory<lb/>
is still exceptionally keen. I can vouch for this since I have had<lb/>
occasion to refer to incidents and events of the 1900-1901 days here<lb/>
in Cuba in my correspondence with him in the past ten years or more.<lb/>
Many of these incidents were of but trivial importance, leading me<lb/>
to the conclusion that those of paramount importance are still fresh<lb/>
in his memory.</p>
<p>I would stake my ticket for entrance through The Golden<lb/>
Gate that you will not receive any biased information from Dr. Kean.<lb/>
Like the fine, old Virginia gentleman that he is, General Kean is<lb/>
the soul of honor. Insofar as the work of Reed in Cuba is concerned,<lb/>
General Kean has always been an authority. Today, he is the highest<lb/>
living authority on Reed's work here in Cuba. In the Reed-Finlay<lb/>
dispute, he is one of the few in authority who has never had an axe<lb/>
to grind. Admittedly, he was one of Major Reed's most intimate<lb/>
friends for many years prior to his death and was with him at his<lb/>
bedside when he prematurely passed on. Notwithstanding this intimacy<lb/>
and the further fact that they were both Virginians and graduates of<lb/>
the same university, in addition to being brother officers in the<lb/>
Medical Corps of the Army, I am entirely certain that General Kean<lb/>
will give you no misinformation in the matter at issue.</p>
<p>I do not know that General Kean is an authority on yellow<lb/>
fever in general, or rather its history. At that, I presume you<lb/>
are better posted than he is, based on your findings over the past<lb/>
three or four years. He can, however, and will give you the un-<lb/>
varnished truth on Reed's work and its relation to Finlay, both of<lb/>
whom he knew very well.</p>
<p>I would suggest that, you being the younger medico of the<lb/>
two, it would be in order for you to write General Kean first. You<lb/>
may wish to send him a questionnaire and I am sure he will make an<lb/>
honest reply to any question you may put to him. You need not<lb/>
hesitate in the matter of being frank in submitting your questions.<lb/>
I am quite certain that General Kean would like very much to have the<lb/>
Reed-Finlay contentions handled by an impartial and conscientous in-<lb/>
vestigator like yourself. Also, I am of the opinion that the General<lb/>
would not, at his age, care to write a separate paper or article. He<lb/>
will give you information free of any ulterior motive and I imagine<lb/>
that the obligation on your part to consider him as a collaborator,<lb/>
and so mention him, would be left entirely with you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
