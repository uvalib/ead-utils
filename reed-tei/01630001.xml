<salute>My darling Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Day follows day,<lb/>
and night to night succeeds, &amp; yet<lb/>
not <hi>one word</hi> from your sweet<lb/>
self! What can be the matter? Have<lb/>
you dropped me from the list of your<lb/>
correspondents, my darling? Or is it<lb/>
that some unlucky fate has o'er-<lb/>
taken your letter? Oh! these misera-<lb/>
ble Rail-roads &amp; heartless post-mas-<lb/>
ters! Perhaps, some careless one, of<lb/>
the last-named tribe, has tossed<lb/>
your darling letter on some lone-<lb/>
ly, out-of-the-way shelf, little dream-<lb/>
ing of my anxiety to receive it.<lb/>
Can it be that you have not received<lb/>
my letters? Two weeks ago, to-day (Tuesday)<lb/>
I received a sweet message from you<lb/>
&amp; one that, at the same time, made me<lb/>
anxious. I immediately replied to it<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01630002"/>
&amp; carried my letter to Portsmouth on<lb/>
Wednesday &amp; saw it safely in the P.O.<lb/>
In this one I told you that I should<lb/>
expect a letter when I reached Ports-<lb/>
mouth the following Tuesday. I also<lb/>
wrote on Sunday &amp; again on Friday,<lb/>
after reaching home, enclosing Dr<lb/>
Hoff's note. And yet, after waiting all<lb/>
this long while, I have not heard so<lb/>
much as one word from Murfreesboro!<lb/>
I would not be so solicitous, did I not<lb/>
think that your letter has been mis-<lb/>
carried &amp; that I will never get it- If<lb/>
I only knew that you had not written,<lb/>
I would be satisfied, since it is<lb/>
one of my greatest pleasures to yield,<lb/>
at all times, to your own good judge-<lb/>
ment- I do not retreat from the posi-<lb/>
tion I took, when in Murfreesboro,<lb/>
to wit; write, my darling, whenever it is<lb/>
suitable for you to do so; I shall,<lb/>
at all times, be only too happy to hear<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01630003"/>
from you. Today, when no letter came,<lb/>
Mrs Vaughan laughed heartily at my<lb/>
discomforture &amp; said, &ldquo;I wouldn't have<lb/>
a Sweet-heart, who neglected me<lb/>
as yours does;&rdquo; to which I quickly<lb/>
replied, that I would have her as<lb/>
my sweetheart, and love her too,<lb/>
if she did not write <hi>but once a<lb/>
year</hi>, provided I got the letter -- and<lb/>
<hi>it is true</hi>! So that you perceive that<lb/>
I am not complaining of any infre-<lb/>
quency of writing on your part. I am<lb/>
too well aware of the value of your<lb/>
time &amp; the many dut<del>e</del>ies, <del>you</del>that are to be<lb/>
performed; &amp; am just as well as-<lb/>
sured of your love as if you<lb/>
wrote every day- Mrs V. does her best<lb/>
at teasing me, but as I always ac-<lb/>
knowledge the force of her arguments<lb/>
she is, of course, unsuccessful. She<lb/>
reminds me of you, more &amp; more, every<lb/>
day- Really, when she is talking in<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01630004"/>
another room, I can scarcely believe<lb/>
that it is not you, so much is her voice<lb/>
like yours- Her manner of expression &amp;<lb/>
her walk is an exact reproduction<lb/>
of yours -- &amp; for this, I love her- How<lb/>
could I help loving her, when she re-<lb/>
calls so vividly to my mind my own<lb/>
precious Emilie! I trust that I stand<lb/>
well in her estimation, but when I am<lb/>
at home, I carry on so <del>much</del> fool-<lb/>
ishly that I am afraid she will be<lb/>
displeased. Certainly there is nothing<lb/>
that I would not do to win her<lb/>
love, &amp; this same feeling I entertain<lb/>
toward every member of your family.</p>
<p>I did not intend, however, in commen-<lb/>
cing <add>this letter, to write</add> <del>you</del> a long one- This pleasure<lb/>
I reserve till after the reception<lb/>
of yours, which I trust will be to-<lb/>
morrow- Excuse haste-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, darling,<lb/>
your affectionate &amp; devoted,</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
