My dear Doctor Carter:</p>
<p>Your letter of Oct. 12, Corrected Oct.29<lb/>
has been received and read with the greatest interest. I think<lb/>
this is one of the most interesting letters I have gotten from<lb/>
even though they are all very interesting.</p>
<p>I made a copy of this letter and sent it to Dr. Garcia<lb/>
Medina, who is a very great admirer of yours. Later we will trans-<lb/>
late it and send copies of the translation to persons who are<lb/>
properly interested in our work.</p>
<p>This evening I am leaving for Cartagena to help Corrigan<lb/>
get things organized there. I have been planning to go there for<lb/>
some time but have been unable to do so on account of Dr. Miller's<lb/>
illness. He had what appeared to be a pretty severe case of dengue,<lb/>
the rash came out on the 3rd day. We sent him to Dr. Drennen's<lb/>
Clinica as we did not have things so arranged here as to take care<lb/>
of him in our quarters here at the main office.</p>
<p>We are going ahead first with our organization of the<lb/>
coast, with the plan to go on up the river from here. In the upper<lb/>
river we already have the work going from Girardot to Puerto Berrio<lb/>
Barranca-Bermeja and Puerto Wilches. On the coast we are working<lb/>
Barranquilla, Cartagena, Puerto Colombia and will investigate Santa<lb/>
Marta, with the idea of having a clean and non-infectable coast, thus<lb/>
avoiding as much as possible quarantine difficulties, later to pro-<lb/>
ceed up the river by way of Colomar, Magangue, etc., until we meet<lb/>
the work from up the river. In addition to this we have the work<lb/>
going in Cucuta, so you see we are about organized in so far as<lb/>
the main defensive program for Colombia is concerned.</p>
<p>As the situation is at the present time we have an ex-<lb/>
posed infectable territory in sufficiently close contact with the<lb/>
Bucaramanga district for something to show up if there still is<lb/>
Yellow fever in the country. I do not regard this territory with<lb/>
any serious apprehension, and the fact of the matter is that I am<lb/>
rather hoping that something might show up there, which would give<lb/>
me just the weapon I need to push our present program with the<lb/>
&ldquo;gunpowder&rdquo; behind it which is <unclear>acking</unclear> at the present time, with a<lb/>
doubtful situation in Bucaramanga and nothing but rumors outside<lb/>
to spur the people and the authorities along. <unclear>Notwithstanding</unclear> all<lb/>
this we are getting ahead even better than I had hoped.</p>
<p>We have just completed the first rivisin of the entire<lb/>
city of Barranquilla, and have an average house index of a little<lb/>
over 51%. Some of the districts were started earlier as a conse-<lb/>
quence of which the index in those has come done and helped to<lb/>
bring the general index down to the figure which I have just quoted.</p>

<p>Dr. Carter</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>November 26, 1923.</p>
<p>Since leaving Bucaramanga my time has been taken up with<lb/>
travel and organization and I have not had time to make any<lb/>
further detailed studies of cases of sickness. We have had what<lb/>
appears to be quite an extensive epidemic of dengue here in<lb/>
Barranquilla, but no cases have been reported to me by the local<lb/>
medical profession as suspicious of yellow fever. There was one<lb/>
case of illness in a man going from here to Santa Marta and from<lb/>
there to the Canal Zone, took sich aboard after leaving here on<lb/>
Nov. 11, left Santa Marta on the 13th and died in Colon Hospital<lb/>
on the 16th with anuria. The Health Authorities there are divided<lb/>
as to whether or not it was a case of yellow fever, as Fessler<lb/>
wrote me they were a little more than 50% inclined to call it <unclear>Y. F.</unclear><lb/>
They stated however that they did not find albumen in the urine.<lb/>
I have received no further details.</p>
<p>I sort of feel however that even incidents of this kind<lb/>
bear us up in the justification of being on the coast for the pur-<lb/>
pose of anticipating things of this kind.</p>
<p>Dr. Gregg of the I.H.B., has just been here and I have dis-<lb/>
cussed the situation quite fully with him, presenting the possibili-<lb/>
ties of what might happen and what I thought ought to be done and<lb/>
what I might do under the different circumstances that he might ex-<lb/>
plain the matter personally on arrival in New York.</p>
<p>There was a report that there had been two cases of supposed<lb/>
yellow fever in Cartagena, and I am going there tonight as stated<lb/>
to see what I can find <del>a</del>out.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hanson and the children are on the Canal Zone, but I<lb/>
think that if I can get a suitable house I will bring them here<lb/>
after Christmas. This is certainly a most unsatisfactoyr way of<lb/>
living. I have been with my family less than six days in the last<lb/>
six months.</p>
<p>I am having the matter of the books, which you want, looked<lb/>
up.</p>
<p>We all here in the office are hoping for your speedy re-<lb/>
covery and are looking forward with pleasure to reading your<lb/>
history as well as many other things.</p>
<p>Very sincerely yours,<lb/>
Henry Hanson<lb/>
Regards to Laura.<lb/>
