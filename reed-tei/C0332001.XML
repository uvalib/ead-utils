Dr. Blanton P. Seward,<lb/>
Lewis-Gale Hospital,<lb/>
Roanoke, Virginia.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Seward:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of December 22nd. would have been answered<lb/>
earlier had it not been for some page proof, which had to be got-<lb/>
ten off before Xmas. Thank you very much for the return of Dr.<lb/>
Frost's unpublished notes on my Father, also for the enclosed<lb/>
stamps--a rare piece of thoughtfulness, which I seldom encounter<lb/>
when furnishing information, as I am often compelled to do, by<lb/>
registered mail.</p>
<p>As to your further questions:</p>
<p>1: Father's first campaign for the control of malaria inthe U. S.<lb/>
(conducted with conspicuous success) was in 1913, at Roanoke Rapids,<lb/>
North Carolina.</p>
<p>2: Dr. Joseph H. White, who assisted Father in yellow fever epi-<lb/>
demics and, in 1905, eliminated yellow fever in New Orleans in a<lb/>
brilliant campaign, is from Georgia. He also, from about 1921, did<lb/>
yellow fever work for the Rockefeller Foundation, being in charge of<lb/>
their work in Brazil for many years. He is an officer in the U. S.<lb/>
Public Health Service (retired).</p>
<p>3; Dr. Frost is a Virginian and was considered by my Father the<lb/>
foremost epidemiologist of America. Certainly he is one of the fore-<lb/>
most of his time. He is, as you probably know, Dean of the Joh<del>s</del><add>n</add>s<lb/>
Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, 615 North Wolfe St.,<lb/>
Baltimore, Md.</p>
<p>I take it for granted that you know that our Surgeon General, Dr.<lb/>
Hugh S. Cumming, of the U. S. Public Health Service is a Virginian.</p>
<p>I am enclosing my copy of The Bulletin of the International Health<lb/>
Board for October 1925, which contains a photograph of Father as, I<lb/>
regret to say, I have no others, save framed ones<unclear>,</unclear> <del>available,</del> If this<lb/>
cannot be reproduced for your paper, you can get an unmounted copy<lb/>
from the photographer on &ldquo;shiney paper&rdquo; (a &ldquo;squegee&rdquo; as they are called)<lb/>
for from 50 cts. to a dollar. These reproduce<del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> far better than the<lb/>
dull finish used in regular photographs. The photographer is</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Jeanne Bennett,<lb/>
5 East Hamilton Street,<lb/>
Baltimore, Md.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tell her that you want &ldquo;the official photograph&rdquo; of Dr. Carter. It is<lb/>
so called as being the one most used. By the way, this photograph is<lb/>
the basis of a portrait, painted after Father's death, which was hung<lb/>
in Hanover Court House, with those of Patrick Henry, Henry Clay and<lb/>
other &ldquo;sons of Hanover&rdquo; in 1926. The Inscription &ldquo;Lux exstincta lucet&rdquo;<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fc0332002"/>
lucet&rdquo;<lb/>
was chosen by Dr. Thayer, of Baltimore, and the rest of the in-<lb/>
scription by the late Dr. Ennion Willioms, of Virginia.</p>
<p>I wish much that I could see you and show you whatever I<lb/>
have that might be of use to you. I am impressed with the thorough<lb/>
way in which you are going about your paper, taking time to really<lb/>
collect your data, and feel sure that the result will be well worth<lb/>
the reading. If you ever pass through Birmingham, my brother, his<lb/>
wife and myself, will bevery glad to see you. My brother, as you<lb/>
probably know, is a doctor, who is putting into his chosen branc<del>e</del><add>h</add> of<lb/>
internal medicine the same genius, selfless enthusiasm and indefatiguable<lb/>
work that Father put into preventive medicine. His wife is a roentgenolo-<lb/>
gist (M. D. of Tulane) with much post graduate work in her specialty (Massa-<lb/>
chusetts General, Cornell Clinic etc.) You see then that I am spending<lb/>
my winter in a familiar and congenial atmosphere.</p>
<p>With very best wishes for the New Year, and trusting that you<lb/>
will not hesitate to let me know if there is a chance that I may be of<lb/>
further use to you,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>
Enclosure,<lb/>
<seg>
P. S. There is no hurry about the return of the enclosed Bulletin, al-<lb/>
though, of course, I would like to have it as soon as convenient to you.<lb/>
This, because, as you see, it is the only copy I have in my files.<lb/>
