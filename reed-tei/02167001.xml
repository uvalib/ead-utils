Oswald Villard, Esq.,<lb/>
&ldquo;Evening Post,&rdquo;<lb/>
New York City.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Villard:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In the &ldquo;Evening Post&rdquo; of the 24th ultimo, is an<lb/>
article entitled <hi>&ldquo;Fever Cases Concealed&rdquo;</hi>. This article in its<lb/>
statements and especially in its inferences, is most unjustice to<lb/>
General Ludlow, General Brooke and myself. It is unjust to me, be-<lb/>
cause it makes inferences which are not warranted by my statements;<lb/>
it is unjust to General Ludlow and General Brooke, because it gives<lb/>
the public to understand that I have charged him with concealing<lb/>
Yellow Fever during his administration of the city. I have never<lb/>
made any statement from which inferences of this kind could be<lb/>
drawn, and I wish you would correct the impression produced by the<lb/>
article.</p>
<p>The following is what took place: When I arrived in New York,<lb/>
I was asked a good deal about yellow fever and the sanitary condi-<lb/>
tion in Havana, the same was true in Washington. I soon found that<lb/>
there was a general impression that the sanitary conditions in<lb/>
Havana were not as good as they formerly were, and there seemed to<lb/>
be an idea abroad that the sanitary precautions were not being<lb/>
taken with the same vigor as hitherto. This general opinion I cor-<lb/>

rected as far as possible, by stating that the sanitary condition<lb/>
of Havana is at present better than ever before as shown by the<lb/>
total number of deaths from all causes, including the deaths from<lb/>
yellow fever; that the sanitary work in Havana had been carried on<lb/>
with the same vigor and intelligence as hitherto, that every sani-<lb/>
tary requisition had been filled in all it applies to personnel,<lb/>
money and material. The work is being conducted by practically<lb/>
the same Officers who conducted it under General Ludlow's adminis-<lb/>
tration; that the work had been progressive, and that Havana, as a<lb/>
whole, was cleaner to-day than ever. The street cleaning department<lb/>
is equally efficient, and the city presents to the casual observer<lb/>
a clean appearance. In addition to all this, the same vital work<lb/>
of cleaning out the cess-pools and vaults has been carried forward<lb/>
regularly, and that thousands upon thousands of houses and their<lb/>
yards have been thoroughly cleaned up and disinfected.</p>
<p>I stated, moreover, that the yellow fever situation was not<lb/>
especially serious, and that it was due entirely to the enormous<lb/>
number of Spanish immigrants that was pouring in through the Port<lb/>
of Havana; that these immigrants are ignorant of sanitation and<lb/>
of the precautions necessary to protect them from disease. They<lb/>
all remain in Havana for a number of days, some of them for a number<lb/>
of weeks, before going into the country, and many remain permanent-<lb/>
ly in Havana. All of these people are food for the fever, and dis-<lb/>

spite all we can do a certain portion of them get it.</p>
<p>In speaking of the fever condition of 1899, I stated that the<lb/>
fever was present in Havana, in 1899, and that the month of December<lb/>
presented the heaviest death rate among the civil population from<lb/>
yellow fever of any December in ten years, that the fever continued<lb/>
with us all winter, and that we all realized that the present summer<lb/>
would undoubtedly be a bad summer for fever.</p>
<p>I also stated that we were now publishing daily the exact<lb/>
yellow fever situation of the city, in order that the general public<lb/>
in the United States and elsewhere might be fully cognizant of the<lb/>
situation existing, and that if they do come to Havana, they do<lb/>
so with the full knowledge of the situation.</p>
<p>I also stated that in the <del>winter</del><add>fall</add> of 1899, there was not a<lb/>
general daily publication of the yellow fever situation in the<lb/>
press, and consequently comparatively little was heard of it at<lb/>
that time. There was nothing stated, directly or indirectly, from<lb/>
which it could be inferred that I implied that there had been any<lb/>
concealment of fever.</p>
<p>In reference to General Brooke, the article was especially un-<lb/>
just to him, as the sanitary condition of Havana has been entirely<lb/>
in the hands of General Ludlow, in fact the whole inference is<lb/>
absolutely contrary to the spirit of the interview. In Washington<lb/>
I took special pains to explain the situation to a number of news-<lb/>

paper representatives, among them, I believe, one of your paper,<lb/>
and it is possible that the inferences in the article of the 24th<lb/>
ultimo have been corrected; if not, I wish you would do so. I am<lb/>
sure you will appreciate the false position in which this article<lb/>
places me, and the great injustice done General Brooke and General<lb/>
Ludlow.</p>
