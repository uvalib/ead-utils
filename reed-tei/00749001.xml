<salute>Dear <hi>Mrs</hi> Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am in a certain amount of<lb/>
trouble &amp; yet I have escaped a worse one.<lb/>
I came here this morning about 8.<add>.12</add> A.M.<lb/>
from Antwerp - I wanted to see the Am.<lb/>
Minister on some international trouble at<lb/>
Antwerp. &amp; go on to Havre tomorrow - on<lb/>
the same train I left. The minister, whom<lb/>
I did not really want to see, is on his va-<lb/>
cation &amp; the Secretary of Legation for<lb/>
whom I asked was attending an <hi>Art</hi><lb/>
Congress - by order of the State Depart. - some<lb/>
where in Brusselles. The Secretary who is<lb/>
usually the man who does the work of<lb/>
the Legation &amp; whom I therefore wanted to see-<lb/>
in Grant Smith. L's Chileno acquaintance<lb/>
I remember now that she told me he was<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00749002"/>
here as secretary - but I had forgotten it.<lb/>
Strange that the only Legation I am likey to<lb/>
visit should be where he is. He is well<lb/>
thought of here. I met no one save a very<lb/>
modest well behaved clerk - a boy - a-<lb/>
bout 21 or 22 years old but young for his<lb/>
years. We had a pleasant chat but it did<lb/>
not seem necessary to talk business to<lb/>
him - or advisable. Gave it up</p>
<p>On my return I find that there is a<lb/>
general strike on the R. R. in the North<lb/>
of France &amp; that if I had not stop-<lb/>
ped in Brussels - I had stopped in<lb/>
Paris - or maybe at Amiens this<lb/>
side - &amp; from neither place could I<lb/>
have gone out in <hi>any</hi> direction.<lb/>
Here I will wait until tomorrow &amp; if<lb/>
it is not reasonably sure that I can get to<lb/>
Havre I will return to Antwerp &amp; thence<lb/>
to Hamburg &amp; finish up that end of the<lb/>
line leaving Havre &amp; Cherbourg to<lb/>
the last &amp; sail <add><del>home</del></add> from the latter port<lb/>
instead of from Hamburg; I mean sail<lb/>
for home, so you see while it is a<lb/>
nuisance. It is far better than if I had<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00749003"/>
gone on to Amiens or Paris, If I can see<lb/>
Mr. Smith tomorrow I will wait over a-<lb/>
nother day - If I can not I think I will<lb/>
start for Hamburg in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I came over here Sunday to the Expo-<lb/>
sition - but it was a dark cloudy day,<lb/>
&amp; I was feeling out of sorts besides. I saw<lb/>
a good deal but enjoy it I did not<lb/>
Only stayed from 8.30 to 2.00, - It is a 1/2<lb/>
hours run &amp; the round trip - 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> class - 4.50 f.<lb/>
= 86 cents - 1 fr. entrance, &amp; .40 f. street car fare<lb/>
&amp; .20 for a map of the grounds. Today was bright<lb/>
&amp; I felt well &amp; I spend as long or longer<lb/>
time there, &amp; saw 5 times as much <del>I on</del><lb/>
I only attempted to see the French &amp; Ital-<lb/>
ian exhibits - because I wanted to see<lb/>
beautiful, not extraordinary things,<lb/>
The exhibit of Geraniums - was a<lb/>
wonder &amp; some of the French Roses <del>I</del><lb/>
likewise. They must have been won-<lb/>
derful a month ago. There are <del>three</del><add>4</add><lb/>
divisions of gardens - Belgium: Hol-<lb/>
land: Germany &amp; France: <del>S</del> Individ-<lb/>
ual florists having Plats - There were<lb/>
some fine flowers - Karl Druskis &amp; a large<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00749004"/>
<del>bl</del> flesh colored Rose - I did not know - in<lb/>
the Luxemburg exhibit - (Germanside)<lb/>
&ldquo;Kitten Fre&racute;es&rdquo; were the florists. But there<lb/>
was nothing to compare with the exhibit<lb/>
<hi>of</hi> Guillot: Verdier &amp; the Lyons Rosarians<lb/>
yet the place, or time, was too damp for Roses,<lb/>
&amp; too cold. The Dahlias too were beauti-<lb/>
ful - &amp; of these the French were also, in my<lb/>
judgment the best, although Holland<lb/>
was a good second; <unclear>her</unclear>geraniums were the finest.</p>
<p>What really was however the most<lb/>
beautiful &amp; most artistic <del>dine</del> exhibit<lb/>
I saw was - don't laugh - the<lb/>
dressmakers models - <hi>wax</hi> my dear<lb/>
I am sorry to say - dressed up in the French<lb/>
section: Reverton: Red fern: Pinand (I<lb/>
think &ldquo;Pinand&rdquo;) &amp; Revillon &amp; <del>had</del> a number<lb/>
of others had a lot of wax models<lb/>
which were artistically <hi>beautiful.</hi><lb/>
They were beautifully dressed &amp; the<lb/>
dresses became the style <hi>the face</hi><lb/>
as well as the figure, - of the model &amp;<lb/>
they were graceful in pose, &amp; were <hi>a-<lb/>
bout</hi> to move, even if they did not<lb/>
They had <hi>expression</hi>, &amp; a haughty<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00749005"/>
face, would be on a model with a<lb/>
haughty carriage &amp; pose &amp; be dressed<lb/>
in character. It really was a beauti-<lb/>
ful &amp; artistic exhibit - one or two<lb/>
only were out of <del>place</del> relation with their<lb/>
clothes. They - the French - are surely an ar-<lb/>
tistic people.</p>
<p>None of the pictures are in the Ex. proper-<lb/>
- which I did not know - except a few of the<lb/>
works of Rubens - in the &ldquo;Rubens Heris&rdquo; a<lb/>
replica of his house &amp; extremely interes-<lb/>
ting. In this are the original pictures<lb/>
which he kept himself - a small sized<lb/>
&ldquo;Descent from the Cross&rdquo; &amp; some others.<lb/>
Some of them - 2 at any rate are no credit<lb/>
to him. <hi>If</hi> I stay over tomorrow - I will<lb/>
do so for the purpose - I will go to the old<lb/>
palace - where there is a full - <hi>very</hi> full-<lb/>
collection of the Flemish school. Rubens:<lb/>
Teniers: Vandyke: Jordaens <add>the van Eyks</add> &amp; some<lb/>
one or two others. The pictures have been<lb/>
loaned from other than Flemish Gal-<lb/>
leries. Dresden: Munich: London &amp; Paris.<lb/>
It is <hi>only</hi> Flemish Art however &amp; early<lb/>
Flemish art.</p>
<p>Yesterday I spent about 1 1/2 hours be-<lb/>
fore the &ldquo;Descent from the Cross&rdquo; in the<lb/>
Antwerp Cathedral. It has neither<lb/>
the passion nor the Conviction that a<lb/>
Spanish or Italian painter <add><del>or a German either</del></add> had put<lb/>
in it. I don't think Rubens believed<lb/>
it happened to the Son of God <add>or felt it happened at all</add>. A Ger-<lb/>
man of the same age (&ldquo;time&rdquo; I mean) had<lb/>
made a far <unclear>ruder</unclear> work which would have<lb/>
brought tears to ones eyes. <hi>He</hi> didn't<lb/>
believe it. Yet it is a wonderful<lb/>
&amp; a noble picture &amp; a long ways<lb/>
from his &ldquo;Susannas&rdquo; - 2 of them I am<lb/>
sorry to say - which no gentleman could<lb/>
have drawn.</p>
<p>There is a Cathedral here - wonderful<lb/>
in its out side <del><unclear>view</unclear></del> appearance - The<lb/>
one in Antwerp is wonderful <hi>inside</hi><lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00749006"/>
&amp; beautiful &amp; Majestic - the clear spring<lb/>
of the groined arches in the middle<lb/>
aisle is very impressive, &amp; the entire<lb/>
absence of pews - &amp; - I am sorry to say - the<lb/>
extreme paucity of worshipers adds<lb/>
to the general effect of the interior.</p>
<p>I have some photographs - cards only - of<lb/>
both places - which I will bring. I do not<lb/>
feel like getting <hi>6</hi> cards 10 cents &amp; pay-<lb/>
ing 5 cents a piece to send them.</p>
<p>I have got Ned a pair of gloves 5.90 f.<lb/>
&amp; myself a pair for 4.25 that look <del>part</del><lb/>
just as good. I got him 7 1/2: I have <hi>8</hi> s<lb/>
&amp; they suit <hi>me</hi>, but he would consider them<lb/>
too tight. I saw some <hi>wonderful</hi> glass<lb/>
today that one might have bought-simply<lb/>
for its beautty - only I could not carry it &amp;<lb/>
it was not cheap - some from <unclear>Haida</unclear> - in Bo-<lb/>
hemia &amp; some from France-</p>
<p><hi>Oh</hi>, tell laura I saw a wonderful bunch<lb/>
of Artificial <hi>Orchids</hi>, our &ldquo;Shower of Gold&rdquo;<lb/>
&amp; the large yellow &amp; purple Catleyas<lb/>
Does she remember how we looked for<lb/>
them in San Jose. I thought they were<lb/>
the natural flowers - they were in a bouquet<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f00749007"/>
with Asparagus - on a corsage - I think<lb/>
one calls it. The pansies too I could not<lb/>
have told from real ones.- Both French,<lb/>
Can't say that I have enjoyed seeing these<lb/>
things quite as much as I expect to telling<lb/>
of them. However I am glad I have<lb/>
seen them. I did <hi>not</hi> see too much<lb/>
&amp; did not let myself get over fatigued<lb/>
but I <hi>am</hi> fatigued.</p>
<p>Wish I were en route to Louisville,<lb/>
Good night.</p>

Independently of &ldquo;la gr&egrave;ve&rdquo; this<lb/>
is an exceedingly difficult<lb/>
Country to travel in, change cars so<lb/>
often.<lb/>
13) Back at Antwerp. I saw Mr<lb/>
Smith. Did not get a chance to see the<lb/>
pictures - although I <hi>could</hi> have done<lb/>
so. The strike continues - so I<lb/>
am en route to Hamburg - &amp; will come<lb/>
back later for Cherbourg &amp; Havre<lb/>
<del>U</del> I am certainly sorry to have my itinerary so broken in on- This job is disagreea-<lb/>
ble enough without that.<lb/>
