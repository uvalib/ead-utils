<p>Kean comments on Wood's manuscript. He believes that Reed or Lazear would have volunteered to be inoculated before Carroll. Kean suggests that Lazear believed in the mosquito theory and was the first to try it on himself.</p>

<salute>My dear Col. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was thinking this morning<lb/>
of you and was looking up my<lb/>
file to see how long it had been<lb/>
since I heard from you when<lb/>
the mail came with your good<lb/>
letter of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and the photographs<lb/>
I am so pleased to get that of the<lb/>
family group. My first remark<lb/>
to Mrs Kean was I am so glad to<lb/>
see your mother there and my<lb/>
next was how young they look!<lb/>
Your mother with her dark hair looks<lb/>
as if she might be the mother of that<lb/>
pretty girl standing behind Mrs Hench<lb/>
instead of the grandmother.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06401070"/>
<p>2</p>
<p>It was interesting to note that the<lb/>
mother and your mother had their<lb/>
eyes on the baby John Bixler, and<lb/>
Susan was so proud to be holding<lb/>
him.</p>
<p>I am delighted that you will have<lb/>
that trip to the West Coast and<lb/>
will see Mrs Lazear and Gen.<lb/>
Truby. I will be keen to know your<lb/>
impression of the former. Her repu-<lb/>
tation is that of being a difficult<lb/>
person, but perhaps you with your<lb/>
cordial and tactful approach will<lb/>
get her to thaw out. I hope Truby<lb/>
will have his book by that time. I<lb/>
am hoping to see it in print too &amp;<lb/>
with the illustrations. I am not such<lb/>
a picture sharp as you and Truby are<lb/>

WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
but that like music is a deficiency<lb/>
of mine. Mrs Laura Wood sent me<lb/>
her book on April 12 and I have<lb/>
read it through, tho it has been a busy<lb/>
time for me. I think it is excellent.<lb/>
There are a few errors of course but<lb/>
they are of details which are quite<lb/>
unimportant. I wrote her it was a<lb/>
bold procedure and a risky one<lb/>
to take the dramatic method and<lb/>
have the <hi>dramatis personae</hi> do the<lb/>
talking and tell the story. But she<lb/>
has gotten away with it very well.<lb/>
Of course you and I know that in<lb/>
the conference of the Board about Aug<lb/>
1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> about experimenting on men, it would<lb/>
be Reed or Lazear, not Carroll, who<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06401072"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
4<lb/>
would say that the members of the<lb/>
Board should be the first to try it.<lb/>
I think that Lazear who believed in<lb/>
the mosquito theory was the first to try<lb/>
it on himself and Carroll who did<lb/>
not believe in it was next and was<lb/>
the first case. I remember that he<lb/>
complained somewhat bitterly that<lb/>
Lazear had given him the whole<lb/>
works. She makes Carroll propose<lb/>
that the members should try it &amp;<lb/>
she makes the visit to Finlay come<lb/>
after this conference. I think it<lb/>
must have been before. But I<lb/>
was in New Jersey with my family<lb/>
at that time and was admiring my<lb/>
little son a week or two old - you<lb/>
know about that - Mrs Wood's book<lb/>
is very readable, and I think is a<lb/>
permanent and valuable addition to<lb/>

the history of the Y.F. Episode.</p>
<p>I have been very busy what with the<lb/>
dedication and the difficult question<lb/>
of invitations and tickets which were<lb/>
much in demand here. Also inside<lb/>
of two days I had four gifts of new<lb/>
books from the authors with very nice<lb/>
flattering inscriptions in them which<lb/>
of course required prompt and<lb/>
carefully written letters of acknowl-<lb/>
edgement, which showed at least<lb/>
some knowledge of the contents.<lb/>
I will get this off now by my<lb/>
last chance tonight and will<lb/>
write about the dedication later</p>
