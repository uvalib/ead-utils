Dr. Felipe Carbonell<lb/>
San Lazaro 413<lb/>
Havana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Carbonell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Have there been any notices in the Havana newspapers during the last three<lb/>
or four months concerning the impending dedication of Camp Lazear? This<lb/>
summer, Dr. Pedro Nogueira and his associates suddenly got busy and completed<lb/>
their plans for making Camp Lazear into a park, erecting a wall on which will<lb/>
appear certain bronze tablets and medallions, erecting a flag pole, building<lb/>
a road and putting in some landscaping. I have had some correspondence with<lb/>
Doctor Nogueira this summer and I have been informed that the dedication is<lb/>
set for December 3, the date of Finlay's birthday or &ldquo;Physicians' Day&rdquo; in<lb/>
Cuba.</p>
<p>Earlier this spring, I was rather concerned because when I received from<lb/>
Doctor Nogueira a blue print of the proposed plan, Walter Reed's Building No. 1<lb/>
was labelled &ldquo;Caseta de Finlay.&rdquo; Although he assured me this was an error,<lb/>
a number of clippings from Havana papers which were sent to me by various<lb/>
friends in Havana, perpetuated that error and wrote as though it were Doctor<lb/>
Finlay who had done the work. Please see the enclosed.</p>
<p>Doctor Nogueira has assured me that the caseta will not be named after Doctor<lb/>
Finlay. It was my hope that the camp should be rededicated as &ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo;<lb/>
but I fear that it will be called &ldquo;Parque Finlay.&rdquo; Now Doctor Nogueira has<lb/>
assured me that justice and fairness will be afforded to Major Reed and his<lb/>
American associates and I must believe him. Nevertheless, I am writing to<lb/>
you to ask if it would be possible for you, diplomatically and very dis-<lb/>
cretely, to get in touch with Doctor Nogueira and ask him about the plans.<lb/>
Camp Lazear is a most appropriate place in which to erect a memorial to <hi>all</hi><lb/>
those concerned with the conquest of yellow fever, in particular Doctor<lb/>
Finlay as well as Major Reed because actually it was the caseta of the Finca<lb/>
San Jose (the same Finca San Jose where later Camp Lazear was erected) where<lb/>
Finlay himself did two or three of his early experiments. Therefore, it is<lb/>
most appropriate that this place be dedicated primarily to Doctor Finlay,<lb/>
Major Reed, Doctor Lazear and their associates.</p>
<p>I am placed in a rather delicate situation. I know it will disappoint certain<lb/>
people if Camp Lazear is not allowed to retain its name, but I have done all<lb/>
I can properly do. Would you be able to see Doctor Nogueira and would you<lb/>
be inclined to do so without letting on that I prompted you to do so? Would<lb/>
it be possible for you to approach him, merely saying that you had seen the<lb/>
former newspaper clippings and that you had heard of the impending dedication<lb/>
and since you have been so interested in the project for years, you were anxious<lb/>
to know something more about it and whether you could help in any way.</p>
<p>I have been informed by Doctor Nogueira that the Cuban Government plans to of-<lb/>
ficially invite certain Americans, such as the Surgeon General or his deputy<lb/>
and so on, to attend the ceremony and I myself am making plans to fly down for<lb/>
it. However no official invitations, I believe, have been sent out as yet.</p>

<p>I do hope that this affair can be made the occasion for a demonstration of<lb/>
Cuban-American friendship, especially a friendship between Cuban and American<lb/>
physicians. I shall appreciate your reaction to the proposed plans and I<lb/>
hope that the plans of those in charge will satisfy you and the rest of us<lb/>
who have been so anxious to have this Camp dedication.</p>

P.S.: To remind you of the significance of Camp Lazear, of Reed's little<lb/>
building and also of the rediscovery of the camp, permit me to send the<lb/>
enclosed reprint. The rediscovery is described on pages 3 through 7.<lb/>
