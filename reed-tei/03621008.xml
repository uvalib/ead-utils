<salute>My dear Hutch:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Have you warned Dr. Sawyer not to make his talk too professional? Physicians<lb/>
are so used to giving medical talks that sometimes they forget the nature of their<lb/>
audience. This morning I had a letter from Dr. Sawyer, suggesting that I tell the story<lb/>
of the work of the Yellow Fever Commission and that he would &ldquo;limit himself largely to<lb/>
an account of the subsequent work in yellow fever which developed from the historic in-<lb/>
vestigations of the commission. I shall therefore avoid giving any narrative account<lb/>
of the commission's experiments but shall of course need to refer to Dr. Lazear and the<lb/>
part which he took and the significance of his sacrifice.&rdquo; The reason that I fear that<lb/>
he may be planning a talk too technical for your audience is that he has asked my help<lb/>
on getting from Miss Agramonte some information on one of Dr. Agramonte's monkey experiments.<lb/>
Unless Sawyer's reference to monkey experiments is very general, I am afraid he is already<lb/>
getting too highbrow. I suggest that you write to him, saying that you have written to<lb/>
both of us to keep our talks rather popular. In answering him today, I will not tell him<lb/>
this although I would like to. If I did, and you wrote him the same thing in a day or<lb/>
two, he might know the source of the suggestion and it should come from you, not me.</p>
<p>We have made a new discovery. Miss Rojas has discovered her father's old<lb/>
journal-cash book with notations as to the rent money received from &ldquo;Major Mr. Reed&rdquo; and<lb/>
later from &ldquo;Major J. R. Kean&rdquo; who acted as Reed's disbursing quartermaster officer.<lb/>
I am having these photographed and translated, and attested <unclear>too.</unclear> This should be the last<lb/>
straw to break down the resistance of the Cuban authorities. An airmail from Moran last<lb/>
night gave me more dope on this and also tells me that his further investigation of one of<lb/>
the shacks which we visited makes him feel that it is the remains of Building No. 1 with<lb/>
an extra lean-to and certain other changes. Don't accept this as final. I can't. But the<lb/>
inside of the shack has grooved and tongued boards as described by Reed, it does face the<lb/>
right direction, I believe, and may in truth be the remnants. I am quietly suggesting that<lb/>
they sound out the cost for an option. My own valuation of it would be about $300 or $400<lb/>
for the shack and land, and I should be willing to buy it myself promptly to protect it<lb/>
and later campaign myself among interested physicians and institutions in America for money<lb/>
for its restoration. Keep this quiet or I will have, not only competition in buying it,<lb/>
but they may raise its price beyond all reason. Furthermore, I am not sure that it is the<lb/>
building.</p>
