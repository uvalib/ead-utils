<p>My dear Dr. Hench - I am writing on this rather<lb/>
imposing stationery, as it seems to be all that is at<lb/>
hand, except some rather small note paper, which<lb/>
dont file so well. I was pleased to get your very<lb/>
appreciative telegram and to know that the &ldquo;Contract&rdquo;<lb/>
arrived with glass unbroken. I am sending you<lb/>
some old letters that I came across the other day<lb/>
in looking thru the file to get some data for a<lb/>
young woman from Vassar who wants to write a<lb/>
short life of Walter Reed and was sent to me by<lb/>
his son Gen. Walter Lawrence Reed. I dont think you<lb/>
have seen them and there may be something in<lb/>
those from Agramonte which may be of interest. How<lb/>
the letter press copies of the letters from Gen. Sternberg<lb/>
got into my file I dont remember. Probably they were<lb/>
left in the personal file and Mr Jones brought them<lb/>
to me to see if they were of any value.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06302149"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
Mr. Hagedoon's quotation from Gen. Frank McCoy is of<lb/>
interest. Hagedoons was writing the life of Gen. Leo-<lb/>
nard Wood in 1929 and of course wanted to know<lb/>
all about the yellow fever episode. The chronology<lb/>
record was evidently prepared for his use. I am much<lb/>
puzzled over McCoys statement that Gen. Wood told<lb/>
his aids &amp; personal staff <hi>on Oct. 9</hi> of the definite solu-<lb/>
tion of the Y.F. problem. I did not think he knew<lb/>
about it until Reed told him at the interview when<lb/>
I was present on <hi>Oct 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>. It may be that Gorgas<lb/>
had told him something of what was going on out<lb/>
at Marianao, but Gorgas certainly did not believe<lb/>
at that time in the mosquito theory, see my note<lb/>
of my talk with him just before leaving for work on Jan 30<lb/>
1901 in this memo. I have verified the fact that Gen.<lb/>
Wood's birthday was Oct. 9 and my diary positively fixes<lb/>
the date of Reed's &amp; my interview with him as Oct. 12.<lb/>
Now by your energy and devotion to the quest of<lb/>
truth you have come to know more than anyone in<lb/>
your generation, perhaps than any one alive, as to the<lb/>
facts. I hope therefore that you will constitute your-<lb/>
self the guardian of the Yellow Fever Roll of Honor<lb/>
and see to it that no name of any other person<lb/>
is intruded thereon by Congress. There have been a<lb/>
number of persistent claimants but none of them<lb/>
comply with the requirements originally prescribed<lb/>
and some have been absolutely without merit.</p>

<p>The last and rankest effort, I think I wrote<lb/>
you about. There was a nice old doctor named<lb/>
Poucher who had been for a few months a volunteer<lb/>
surgeon in the Spanish war in the N.Y. Vols.<lb/>
He never got to Cuba or saw a case of Yellow<lb/>
Fever except perhaps some convalescents from<lb/>
Santiago who he may have treated in a hospital<lb/>
near Montauk Point in the summer of 1898.<lb/>
Well he got old &amp; lost his practice and his friends<lb/>
told Rep. Hamilton Fish that something ought to be<lb/>
done for him. So what does Fish do but introduce<lb/>
a bill to have his name inserted in the act creating<lb/>
the Yellow Fever Roll of Honor to come just after the<lb/>
name of John J. Moran, altho he did not do<lb/>
any of the acts recited in the Bill H. R. 13060<lb/>
approved Feb. 28, 1929. I think that a protest who made<lb/>
at the cynical immorality of such a proposition<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06302151"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
4<lb/>
but it shows what sort of things may happen<lb/>
if some one is not on guard. I asked Colonel<lb/>
now Brig. Gen. (temp.) <add>A. G. Love</add> Med. corps to look out for<lb/>
this, and inclose you a copy of the answer I<lb/>
had from him. But he retires next month<lb/>
and I dont know who will be on guard. They<lb/>
are so swamped with work now that anything<lb/>
may happen. I have forgotten just what the<lb/>
ground of Lambert's claim was, that Gen. Love<lb/>
refers to in his letter, but I think like Dr.<lb/>
Roger Post Ames he just looked after &amp; cared for<lb/>
yellow fever cases but was not himself an<lb/>
experimental case, and contributed nothing to<lb/>
the advancement of science.</p>
<p>You can keep these letters if you wish - I think<lb/>
you will make a better disposition of them<lb/>
than if I keep them.</p>
<p>With Cordial regards</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours</salute>
<signed>J.R.Kean</signed>
<seg>
I would like to have the chronology back after<lb/>
you have copied it as I may need to<lb/>
refer to it.<lb/>
