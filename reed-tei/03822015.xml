Dr. Morris Fishbein<lb/>
Editor, JOURNAL of the<lb/>
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION<lb/>
535 North Dearbora Street<lb/>
Chicago, Illinois<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Fishbein:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Dr. P. S. Hench has written me that you have accepted<lb/>
his article on Yellow Fever for publication in HYGEIA at an<lb/>
early date. Also that you wish to use the new Cornwell<lb/>
painting, &ldquo;Conquerors of Yellow Fever&rdquo; as an illustration.</p>
<p>I am enclosing a couple of pages from the New York Sunday<lb/>
MIRROR which gives some idea of the color scheme of the paint-<lb/>
ing even though it is only a newspaper reproduction.</p>
<p>Of course the MIRROR is not purchased to any extent by<lb/>
physicians and others in whom we are directly interested. It<lb/>
does, however, aid in the educational job for the general<lb/>
public, which was one of our motives in sponsoring the series.  </p>
<p>Dr. Hench suggested that we might be willing to supply<lb/>
you with inserts in 4-color process. It is possible that we<lb/>
might do this but I am afraid that it would delay the publica-<lb/>
tion of the article beyond the date which you may have schedul-<lb/>
ed. We could not possibly have inserts before October 1. How-<lb/>
ever, we can supply you with 4-color process plates of a suit-<lb/>
able size a little before September 1st or a black and white<lb/>
plate at any time. </p>
<p>It is my understanding that Dr. Hench's introductory re-<lb/>
marks on Cornwell and the painting will be used as an explana-<lb/>
tory note covering the use of the Cornwell painting.    </p>
<p>Will it be possible for us to purchase reprints in quan-<lb/>
tity after the article has appeared in HYGEIA? We are planning<lb/>
to give to physicians and hospitals approximately 25,000 large<lb/>
4-color reproductions of the painting over a period of the next<lb/>
two or three years. I should like to have a reprint of Dr.<lb/>
Hench's illustrated article with additional halftones (no design-<lb/>
ated in the reprint) on the development of the painting, to give<lb/>
with each picture presented to physicians.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03822016"/>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>At least 12,000 of our large reproductions of the<lb/>
painting will go to physicians and hospitals during the<lb/>
months of October, November, and December. You can there-<lb/>
fore understand my interest in seeing the publication day<lb/>
for the article placed at as early a date as is convenient<lb/>
to you.</p>
<p>If you can use 4-color process plates of the painting<lb/>
will you kindly let me know at your earliest convenience.<lb/>
I will push the engraver who is now working on them for the<lb/>
earliest possible delivery. If inserts or a black and white<lb/>
plate are your preference, please don't hesitate to ask for<lb/>
them.</p>
