<salute>Dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of the 8th has remained unanswered<lb/>
until this time for the reason that I have been so busy<lb/>
on other matters that I have been unable to investigate<lb/>
the proposition of obtaining top minnows from the Shrader<lb/>
Mill Pond, which is at the head waters of the Waxahatchee<lb/>
Creek.</p>
<p>Yesterday, together with another man, I spent<lb/>
two hours on the shores of this pond and the creek above<lb/>
and below in an attempt to gather some specimens for the<lb/>
purpose of identification. During this time we saw but<lb/>
one minnow and we were unable to catch it.</p>
<p>I gathered from the description which Mr. LePrince<lb/>
gave that this pond is well stocked with minnows during<lb/>
mosquito season, and I presume that the reason we had no<lb/>
better luck is because these fish are feeding on the bottom<lb/>
rather than on the top at this time. I had only a dip net<lb/>
to catch them in, <del>and</del> before I went I had the impression<lb/>
I would have no difficulty in gathering such specimens as<lb/>
I would need; however, I now believe that if we are to<lb/>
gather any specimens either for identification or for the<lb/>
purpose of breeding, it would be necessary to set some type<lb/>
of fish trap on the bottom of the pond properly baited or<lb/>
else to drag the pond with a close mesh screen.</p>
<p>The main thought which occurs to me, however,<lb/>
after having had this experience is that we are not making<lb/>
any mistake in looking elsewhere for other varieties of<lb/>
minnows and experimenting with them, as well as with the<lb/>
local varieties.</p>
<p>Should these minnows increase in numbers during<lb/>
the coming months, we can, of course, gather them by means<lb/>
of seine and stock the reservoir with them, but if the num-<lb/>

bers should remain as they were yesterday it looks as though<lb/>
the stocking of the reservoir from this pond would be al-<lb/>
most an impossible proposition.</p>
<p>I was very interested in the extracts from Mr.<lb/>
LePrince's letter to you which you sent me. I think that<lb/>
he is quite correct concerning the importance which the<lb/>
top minnows will play in the mosquito control in our reser-<lb/>
voir. Something that occurs to me right at this point is<lb/>
that I examined the Shrader Mill Pond, which is about<lb/>
fifty years old, for floating debris and I found that<lb/>
floating pine needles were in great abundance, together<lb/>
with leaves and twigs, pieces of bark, etc.</p>
<p>In this back woods country where our Lock 12<lb/>
reservoir is located, I believe that it will always be<lb/>
impossible to keep the surface free from similar material.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Dine, of the Bureau of Entomology, is<lb/>
hoping to visit us during the early part of February and<lb/>
help us select a breeding spot for the establishment of<lb/>
a hatchery for such minnows as we will start to breed.</p>
<p>I am writing to Mr. LePrince to get his ideas<lb/>
about the minnows from Shrader's Pond.</p>
<p>Next week we will begin to put all the people in<lb/>
our Lock 12 camp who are carriers of malaria through an<lb/>
eight weeks treatment of quinine. We are very anxious to<lb/>
go through the coming season without having a single case<lb/>
of malaria in our Lock 12 camp, and we are expecting to take<lb/>
every measure to obtain this result.</p>
<p>Col. Mitchell was recently in the office and he<lb/>
read your letter &amp; pamphlet with great interest, and sends<lb/>
his kindest regards to you.</p>
