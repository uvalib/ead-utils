Dr. Henry Hanson, Director General,<lb/>
Campana Sanitaria contra la Fiebre Amarilla en el Peru,<lb/>
Oficina Central, Avenida Pierola 545,<lb/>
Lima, Peru, S. A.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Hanson:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of June 15th. to hand.</p>
<p>I have received no MSS from Dr. Ezayguirre, though you have men-<lb/>
tioned it as sent both in this letter and your previous one. Best hold<lb/>
on to the copy you have and bring it with you, so as to avoid the chance<lb/>
of losing it in the mails.</p>
<p>1/ You are perfectly welcome to publish the collection of my ar-<lb/>
ticles you have in Spanish and--if you think it worth while--I could<lb/>
have a copy made of the first article on House Infection and send it you.<lb/>
It is at the Surgeon General's Library as a &ldquo;permanent loan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2/ This is not advice--just opinion:--</p>
<p>If Leguia is strong enough--I know he is willing unless it imperils<lb/>
his position--to give you the required backing against politicians in<lb/>
the Sanitary Department, you could probably do good work there--useful<lb/>
to Peru--with even the amount of money that they must spend, for I sup-<lb/>
pose they are still continuing the &ldquo;medicos titulares&rdquo; and &ldquo;medicos de-<lb/>
partmental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the position to be managed honestly, with a well devised plan<lb/>
for developement in the future and with as much energy as the means at<lb/>
hand allows, would be a good thing, if it can be kept up, but two dif-<lb/>
ficulties come in:--</p>
<p>a/ Whether Leguia's position is staple enough for him not to<lb/>
have to use the Sanitary Department as a pawn in his political compaign:<lb/>
and <unclear>b</unclear> How long it would be necessary to continue American supervision.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00934010"/>
<p>supervision.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>I doubt if the first can be answered in the affirmative and I<lb/>
am inclined to think the second would be for a considerable number of<lb/>
years.</p>
<p>I disagree with you in thinking that an American Advisor would<lb/>
be of a great deal of value as it is extremely easy for a Director, act-<lb/>
ing selfishly and in bad faith--as Cardenas at least would have done--<lb/>
to block all the effects of advice, however good or however completely<lb/>
accepted on paper. There are honest men in Peru, however, and--though<lb/>
probably <unclear>no</unclear> so many--some of force. Frankly, I think Saintz and--to<lb/>
a lesser degree--Caballero were such and probably Mediota, the engineer.<lb/>
Whether you could find such a one and use him as an understudy--say for<lb/>
two to five years--and have him continue your work, I do not know.</p>
<p>What I would like to do in your place would be to hold the matter<lb/>
open: report to Dr. Rose on leave without pay--it would, of course, not<lb/>
be fair to receive pay for attending to my own business: see what open-<lb/>
ings there are for good sanitary work from the I. H. B. and the possi-<lb/>
bility of getting assistance from them for either sanitary field or<lb/>
<hi>laboratory</hi> work in Peru. They would be more apt to grant some of this<lb/>
if the man in charge were one they trusted. Also, you could see about<lb/>
putting Carl to school in the U. S. His education is a problem you have<lb/>
also to meet. You say &ldquo;If I were a young man without a family I should<lb/>
enjoy the adventure for awhile.&rdquo; Unquestionably, Martha: Virgil and<lb/>
Mrs. Hanson are a family, but if Carl be provided for you are left in<lb/>
the position of a young man.</p>
<p>Now this is not advice. It is just how a man from another stand-<lb/>
point sees your problem and it may give you a side-light on it.</p>
<p>From a monetary standpoint--not by any means the whole, or even<lb/>
the main consideration, and yet to be considered: <unclear>I</unclear> do not know what<lb/>
your outlook in the U. S. would be right now. Nothing would be permanent<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00934011"/>
permanent<lb/>
3.<lb/>
with the I. H. B. and the home difficulties would be, I suspect, as<lb/>
great as in Peru: Heiser is in the Phillipines for a years stay: and<lb/>
Darling, you know, went from Malacca to Fiji to San Paulo.</p>
<p>State and municipal health positions are 1,000% better than they<lb/>
were 20 years ago and are especially good in the North-west. What your<lb/>
chances would be with them I do not know. If taken up as a life work,<lb/>
naturally, the sooner you get into them the better, even if you went into<lb/>
them at a low salary.</p>
<p>I am quite certain that no Director has as yet been chosen for<lb/>
the African investigation of yellow fever, but I am not quite certain<lb/>
whether that investigation will ever be made. If the business is put<lb/>
off much longer and no yellow fever is reported from Africa it might well<lb/>
be considered unnecessary.</p>
<p>Please let me know when you will arrive in New York as it will be<lb/>
a great pleasure to me to meet you and talk over matters. You would pro-<lb/>
bably send a wireless to the I. H. B. any way and you could ask them to<lb/>
wire me.</p>
<p>My address will be<lb/>
Dr. H. R. Carter,<lb/>
New Glasgow P. O.<lb/>
Amherst County,<lb/>
Virginia.<lb/>
&ldquo;Geddes.&rdquo;<lb/>
This address I will also have in their hands.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you and with very best remembrances to<lb/>
you all, in which Laura joins.</p>

<salute>Very truly your friend,</salute>
