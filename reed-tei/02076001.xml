To the Surgeon General,<lb/>
U.S. Army,<lb/>
(Through Chief Surgeon of the Division)<lb/>
<salute>Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following supplement to the<lb/>
Report on Yellow Fever at Quemados, Cuba, and Columbia Barracks, rend-<lb/>
ered June 15th, 1900.</p>
<p>A few days after submitting the report referred to above,<lb/>
Major J. R. Kean, U.S.V., Chief Surgeon of the Department, fell a<lb/>
victim to the disease in the execution of his duty as Chief Sanitary<lb/>
Officer of the Municipality, and the duties of his office devolved<lb/>
upon me in addition to my own.</p>
<p>Plans had already been made by Major Kean to move the non-<lb/>
immune element from the zone of infection, but his illness prevent-<lb/>
ed him from perfecting his plans.</p>
<p>The municipality being under military law, and General Lee<lb/>
having placed the control of the epidemic in my hands, with authority<lb/>
to do as was deemed best, the problem presented none of the difficult-<lb/>
ies that confront a board of health in the United States.</p>
<p>A camp had been prepared at a distance of two miles from<lb/>
Quemados and to this camp were moved all non-immunes, irrespective<lb/>
of age, sex, or nationality.</p>
<p>Saloons, houses of prostitution, and all resorts where one<lb/>
could contract the disease, were closed, and the town ceased to be<lb/>
an attraction for soldiers and civilian employes.</p>
<p>The Provost Guard that had patrolled the town was withdrawn<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02076002"/>
2<lb/>
and the Rural Guard was placed on duty with orders to arrest all<lb/>
soldiers and civilian employes found within the town.</p>
<p>Orders had already been issued by the Post Commander<lb/>
to all within the post prohibiting any communication with the<lb/>
town, but as is the case with all such orders the soldiers managed<lb/>
to evade the chain of sentries until the Rural Guard was placed in<lb/>
control.</p>
<p>The saloonkeepers and others in the non-immune camp did all<lb/>
in their power to render the quarantine ineffective, but soon gave<lb/>
in, and in a short time the epidemic was over.</p>
<p>Cases continued to occur now and again in the post among<lb/>
the soldiers and civilian employes, but investigation in every in-<lb/>
stance disclosed the fact that the victim had eluded the guard<lb/>
and passed a night in Havana or in Quemados.</p>
<p>In each case the barrack was disinfected, and no case<lb/>
originated within the post.</p>
<p>It was found that without the assistance of the men it was<lb/>
futile to attempt to control the restless spirits in such a large<lb/>
community, and the experiment of drenching the clothing and beds of<lb/>
all in the barrack during the routine of disinfection was tried with<lb/>
the object of rendering all uncomfortable for the night and thereby<lb/>
causing resentment against any culprit who brought the calamity<lb/>
upon them. The result of this experiment exceeded my most sanguine<lb/>
hopes, and it is rare that any soldier has the fortitude to brave<lb/>
a hundred angry men for the sake of a visit to town.</p>
<p>The majority of all cases have been civilians and as the<lb/>
work demanding their presence approaches its termination this un-<lb/>
desirable and dangerous element will be eliminated soon.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f02076003"/>
<p>3</p>
<p>The non-immunes will not be allowed to re-occupy their<lb/>
houses till November 15th, and the saloons and other resorts will<lb/>
be closed indefinitely probably.</p>
<p>In my first report the origin of the epidemic was attrib-<lb/>
uted to a latent infection requiring only suitable conditions,<lb/>
and the fact that the disease has appeared in nearly all localities<lb/>
in the Island at the same time has strengthened my belief.</p>
<p>The inmates of clean and filthy houses have been attack-<lb/>
ed impartially.</p>
<p>A large combined steam and formaline disinfector has been<lb/>
added to our equipment, and in addition to affording a greater<lb/>
sense of security, has saved much property that otherwise would<lb/>
have been burned.</p>
<p>In Quemados and Columbia Barracks there have been forty-<lb/>
one cases up to date with twelve deaths.</p>
<p>Everyone in authority has done all in their power toward<lb/>
the suppression of the epidemic.</p>
<p>I cannot too strongly commend to your consideration<lb/>
Acting Assistant Surgeon Ames, who cared for the patients, Acting<lb/>
Assistant Surgeon Lazear, who made the microscopical and chemical<lb/>
tests, Acting Assistant Surgeon Pinto, who promptly recognized the<lb/>
cases in the Receiving Ward, Privates Colby, Fanning, Folk and Lambert<lb/>
Hospital Corps, U.S.A., who nursed the cases, and Contract Nurses,<lb/>
Ella M. Gillen, Kate S.M. Ledlie, Ella Cook and Alice M. Gillette.</p>
<p>It is a source of great gratification that no one connect-<lb/>
ed with the hospital hesitated at any duty required or showed the<lb/>
slightest fear in the presence of the dread disease.</p>
