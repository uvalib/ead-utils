<p>Interview - Dr. Philip S. Hench with Mr. Paul L. Tate,<lb/>
June 21, 1954, in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>(The questions by Dr. Hench are numbered, but there are<lb/>
sub-questions which are not numbered)</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. What is your name and address?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Paul Lambert Tate, 1530 Tyler Street, Berkeley.</item>
</list></item>
<item>2. Where were you born, and when?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. May 4, 1871 in Washington, D. C.</item>
</list></item>
<item>3. What was your occupation before you went to war? You were<lb/>
a reporter, weren't you?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I was a reporter on the WASHINGTON STAR -- for five<lb/>
years.</item>
</list></item>
<item>What else did you do before you went in the Army?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Well before I went to work on the STAR I worked a<lb/>
short time in the Railway and Mail Service. I was working<lb/>
on the STAR when the war broke out.</item>
</list></item>
<item>4. <add>a</add> You enlisted in what outfit?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I enlisted first in the 3rd Virginia Volunteers --<lb/>
an infantry outfit.</item>
</list></item>
<item>When did you enlist? And where?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. June 6, 1898.</item>
</list></item>
<item>In Washington<add>?</add><lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No. Fredericksburg, Virginia. I had to go down there.<lb/>
You see I belonged to the District of Columbia National Guard<lb/>
and they got away before I could get back in them. So in Virginia<lb/>
1.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04715002"/>
-- the old 3rd Virginia was a famous regiment and I thought<lb/>
sure they'd be sent to the front, so I went down to Fredericks-<lb/>
burg and enlisted in that--the 3rd Virginai Infantry<lb/>
(Mr. Tate added the following in concise form: Enlisted<lb/>
3rd Va. Infty. June 6, 1898; discharged Nov. 6, 1898;<lb/>
Enlisted Hospital Corps <hi>Nov. 21, 1898</hi>; discharged<lb/>
at Ft. Bayard, N Mex. Nov 28, 1904--2 terms,<lb/>
6 years, 5 months continuous service.)</item>
</list></item>
<item><add>4 b</add> Where did you have your training?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. At Camp Alger, Virginia.</item>
</list></item>
<item>5. <add>5</add> When did you go over to Cuba?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I got there -- to Havanna, Dec. 9, 1898 and we went to<lb/>
Pinar del Rio the same night on the train.</item>
</list></item>
<item>What did you do then?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Well, we set up camp that night on arrival.</item>
</list></item>
<item>You were in the Infantry then?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No, no, I was in the Hospital Corps I didn't go with the<lb/>
3rd Virginia Infantry. I got discharged from that Nov. 6, 1898<lb/>
because they didn't go to the front. I was discharged in<lb/>
Richmond, Virginia. The war wasn't really over yet, so I heard<lb/>
they had an ambulance corps at Augusta, Georgia and I went down<lb/>
there and enlisted in the ambulance corps. It turned out to<lb/>
be a hospital corps.</item>
</list></item>
<item>When was that?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. That was <hi>Nov. 30, 1898</hi>.</item>
</list></item>
<item>You went over with the hospital corps?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Yes.</item>
</list></item>
<item>What outfit? Did they call it the Hospital Corps?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Well, it was commanded by a volunteer, Major De Neidman.<lb/>
2.</item>
</list></item>
<pb n="3" id="f04715003"/>
<item>Was it just a Hospital Corps?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No, ... there were some troops over there, but I don't<lb/>
remember who they were. They were a miscellaneous outfit.</item>
</list></item>
<item>How many in your outfit?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Well, it was a pretty big outfit. I think there was<lb/>
about 53, all told.</item>
</list></item>
<item>All enlisted men?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No. There was about 53 enlisted men and they had at that<lb/>
time five doctors and five full stewards and four acting<lb/>
stewards.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Who were the doctors -- remember?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Dr. Lovejoy was one. I was trying to think of the major's<lb/>
name that commanded it, but I can't think of it.<lb/>
(Mr. Tate has added the following memorandum: I now have the<lb/>
names of some of the doctors at Hospital at Pinar del Rio.<lb/>
Most of these were with us when we encamped there, but most of<lb/>
of them were detached before the arrival of Capt. Godfrey, so<lb/>
it won't be of much benefit to you, but I list them:<lb/>
<list type="simple">
<item>Major De Neidman (of Volunteers) C.O.</item>
<item>Major Williams</item>
<item>Lt. Donaldson</item>
<item>Lt. Newlove</item>
<item>Lt. Personol*</item>
<item>Lt. Cooke (came later)</item>
<item>Lt. Amador</item>
<item>Capt. Godfrey<lb/>
(None of these were Reg. Army except Godfrey)<lb/>
The Stewards were:<lb/>
Dextor, Lawrence, Lind, (Head, Non-Com.) Minor &amp; Johnson.<lb/>
Acting Stewards: Smithson, McVeigh, Arnold Fitzgerald.<lb/>
(continuing from the interview)</item>
</list></item>
</list></item>
<item>Any officer who was later connected with yellow fever -- <add>?</add><lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No. They were just temporary -- a lot of volunteers there<lb/>
and they all left later on.</item>
</list></item>
<item>6.<add>#6</add> Now, you're at Pinar del Rio -- you arrived there when?<lb/>
*different spelling, later<lb/>
3.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f04715004"/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Sept. 9th. -- No, not Sept. 9th, arrived Dec. 9th.</item>
</list></item>
<item>What did you do there -- you were a clerk in the Hospital Corps?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Yes. But I wasn't a clerk then. I was just an ordinary<lb/>
man in the Hospital Corps. I never did any nursing, or<lb/>
anything like that. I had no special duties, there are lots<lb/>
of things to be done around a camp. I remember once I worked<lb/>
in the Cook House, not as a cook, just a helper. I wasn't a<lb/>
nurse, so I never had anything to do with that.</item>
</list></item>
<item>You lived in tents?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Yes, in tents.<lb/>
(identification of a photograph of the<lb/>
tent hospital)</item>
</list></item>
<item>When did you become a clerk with Capt. Godfrey?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I can't remember but after that we built a hospital,<lb/>
a big hospital, and Capt. Godfrey came there and took command<lb/>
of us. It seems to me that was the latter part of 1899 -- I<lb/>
think it was sometime in the fall.</item>
</list></item>
<item>7. <add>#7</add> How many soldiers, roughly, were there <del>?</del><add>in Pinar del Rio?</add><lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I don't know. There were a lot of them. I don't know<lb/>
whether it was all of the 1st Infantry. There must have been<lb/>
about 1000. 700 of the 1st Infantry. We had to chase bandits<lb/>
over the mountains so they brought Mountain Batteries and pack<lb/>
mules from the United States. Most of the time there were<lb/>
between two and three thousand soldiers.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Were they in tents always?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. All tents.</item>
</list></item>
<item>What was the size of the town? (Pinar del Rio)<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I'd say -- I'd guess between five and ten thousand.<lb/>
4.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f04715005"/>
(Note: Dr. Hench was told in Pinar by a man who lived there,<lb/>
that there were about 12,000 in 1900)</item>
</list></item>
<item>I am interested now in the epidemic. Can you tell me when you<lb/>
first saw Dr. Cooke?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Dr. Cooke was a doctor in the 1st Inf. -- he wasn't<lb/>
connected with the hospital.</item>
</list></item>
<item>When did he come?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I don't know -- I can't remember. I know he was with<lb/>
the 1st Inf. and then he came over and was attached to the<lb/>
hospital and then the next time I saw him, he was in<lb/>
Columbia Barracks.</item>
</list></item>
<item>So you don't remember anything about Dr. Cooke? In Pinar del Rio?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No.</item>
</list></item>
<item>8. <add>#8</add> Tell us about the epidemic of yellow fever that began in the<lb/>
spring of 1900. According to my notes Dr. Gen. Truby P 94 &check;<lb/>
said it began about April 20th and was still going the middle<lb/>
of July. <add>July 16, 1900</add><lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. There was a peculiar situation. All of a sudden there<lb/>
were a lot of extra deaths. They weren't diagnosed yellow<lb/>
fever. A lot of us knew it was yellow fever ......</item>
</list></item>
<item>Now, wait a minute, why do you say you knew it was yellow fever?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Because we were in town so much and there they made<lb/>
no secret of it. When they had a case of yellow fever,<lb/>
some new Spaniard had moved in there and had yellow fever.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Did you speak Spanish?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I knew enough to get along.<lb/>
5.</item>
</list></item>
<pb n="6" id="f04715006"/>
<item>So, in town you heard of yellow fever -- it's called &lsquo;vomito negro&rsquo;?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I was around town and in the bars, and I knew enough<lb/>
Spanish to understand people and I heard them speaking about<lb/>
people in town, Spanish immigrants, who had vomito negro;<lb/>
and so I knew there was yellow fever in town.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Do you remember when it was?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. That's too long ago -- I don't remember -- sometime in<lb/>
the summer, I imagine.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Then you say, suddenly a lot of soldiers began to get sick, and<lb/>
they came to the hospital, and it was called malaria?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. They called it &lsquo;pernicious&rsquo; malaria.</item>
</list></item>
<item>But you knew, and you think many of the enlisted men were certain<lb/>
it was yellow fever?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Yes.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Were you upset by it?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No. Well, some of them were, because fellows who were<lb/>
new down there were awful scared of yellow fever. I know<lb/>
I was when I first went there, but after a while I got<lb/>
used to it, and didn't bother any more about it. The<lb/>
reason I know it was in town was this: When we found out<lb/>
it was yellow fever, they put a quarentine on between the<lb/>
town and the camp. I heard fellows talking in the hospital,<lb/>
saying what's the use of a quarantine -- we've got yellow<lb/>
fever, they've got yellow fever in Pinar del Rio ----<lb/>
6.</item>
</list></item>
<pb n="7" id="f04715007"/>
<item>In other words, the quarantine was to protect the camp, not the<lb/>
city -- the quarantine meant that the soldiers could not go<lb/>
to the town because of the yellow fever?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Yes.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Now, do you remember when it was that they found there was<lb/>
yellow fever there? Was that after Dr. Agramonte came, or<lb/>
before?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. We knew before....a lot of men......</item>
</list></item>
<item>When did they quarantine --- when was the quarantine put on?<lb/>
After Agramonte came?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. After Agramonte came.</item>
</list></item>
<item>The point is this --- after Agramonte came there, finally the<lb/>
doctors learned that it was yellow fever. And then there was<lb/>
a quarantine put on against the town?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Yes, Sir.</item>
</list></item>
<item>To keep the soldiers from going down town to Pinar del Rio? But<lb/>
the soldiers laughed about this because they knew there was as<lb/>
much yellow fever in the camp as there was down town -- right?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. There wasn't so much down town because the Cubans<lb/>
didn't get it -- when the Spaniards came in, they got it.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Now, even before that, the soldiers in the hospital .....<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Knew all about it. They were sure it was yellow fever.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Did you discuss that with the doctors -- did you ask the doctors<lb/>
whether this was yellow fever?<lb/>
7.<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f04715008"/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No, -- oh, no, we wouldn't ask the doctors that.</item>
</list></item>
<item>You wouldn't have had the nerve to do that?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No.</item>
</list></item>
<item>And you attended many post mortems, did you?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Oh, yes.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Was that before Agramonte came?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Before Agramonte came.</item>
</list></item>
<item>And they were done by Capt. Godfrey?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Yes.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Now, about these post mortems -- did you know it was yellow<lb/>
fever?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I didn't know anything about it then.</item>
</list></item>
<item>When you knew there was yellow fever there, by that time you<lb/>
weren't scared by it? Why was that?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Oh, I don't know. There's so much of it, you just<lb/>
get used to it. There's so much disease there in Pinar<lb/>
del Rio, as long as you stay well for a long time you male?<lb/>
never bothered anything about it. None of the nurses female?<lb/>
ever got it.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Was there any panic among the troops?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I don't know -- I couldn't tell you that</item>
</list></item>
<item>Was there any panic among the Cubans themselves?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No.<lb/>
8.</item>
</list></item>
<pb n="9" id="f04715009"/>
<item>Was there any panic among the hospital corps personnel?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I don't remember. I don't think so.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Was there any concern -- were they worried?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No -- I don't think so. I'll give you one illustration<lb/>
as to why I don't think so. Shortly before they had yellow<lb/>
fever, they wanted to get three volunteers to go to Guanajay<lb/>
where they had a lot of yellow fever. The first sergeant<lb/>
came out and had us in line and he said they had yellow<lb/>
fever at Guanajay and he said he would never send a nurse<lb/>
there unless there were volunteers to nurse yellow fever.<lb/>
They wanted three nurses to volunteer. He turned his eyes<lb/>
left for a second, and while he did so, every man in the<lb/>
outfit stepped forward and he was one of those tough guys,<lb/>
and he looked around and said, &ldquo;Well, you all want to be<lb/>
heroes, eh! Darned good thing, because I wouldn't trust<lb/>
some of you to nurse a cat, now I can pick three good<lb/>
nurses&rdquo; .... I stepped forward too, and I had no idea of<lb/>
nursing yellow fever, but I knew they wouldn't take me<lb/>
anyhow.</item>
</list></item>
<item>You don't remember who they chose?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No.</item>
</list></item>
<item>9. <add>#9</add> Now, Dr. Agramonte--he came on July 19th--tell us about that.<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I remember him because he went through the ward with<lb/>
Capt. Godfrey and I went along with them to take any<lb/>
notes Capt. Godfrey wanted to make. It's the only ...<lb/>
it was the first time I had seen Agramonte. And I<lb/>
9.<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f04715010"/>
noticed the funny way he looked at some of those patients.<lb/>
He knew they had yellow fever, and then he would glance<lb/>
at Capt. Godfrey and he had such a funny quizzical look<lb/>
on his face -- wondering how he could miss that -- how<lb/>
he could call it anything but yellow fever -- that was<lb/>
the impression I got.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Capt. Godfrey was still calling it malaria -- and you knew that<lb/>
it was yellow fever ---<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Well, I wasn't certain. I had a good idea that a lot<lb/>
of it was yellow fever. I wouldn't know that all of it was.</item>
<item>Now, did all of the personnel in the hospital have the same<lb/>
notion? Did they think it was possibly yellow fever?</item>
<item>a. I couldn't tell you that.</item>
</list></item>
<item>But you did?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I knew it, and a lot of others did. You know you<lb/>
associate with a certain number and you know what they<lb/>
think, but there are others that you are not around and<lb/>
you don't know what they think.</item>
</list></item>
<item>But you suspected some of it was yellow fever, and so you knew<lb/>
what Capt. Agramonte meant by the funny look on his face?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Yes, sure I could see that he was surprised that<lb/>
Capt. Godfrey didn't see that it was yellow fever.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Do you know anything about conversation between Agramonte and Godfrey?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">

Discussion of John Morris. Mr. Tate thinks he lives (if still<lb/>
alive) at 230-1&sol;2 Cedar Street, Reading, Pa. He (Morris) enlisted<lb/>

Reed said to Godfrey?<lb/>

<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I couldn't tell you exactly. I wasn't clerk until the built<lb/>
the big hospital --- I think I was working in the pharmacy<lb/>
and Godfrey picked me for his clerk, wanted me to do<lb/>
13.<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f04715014"/>
some clerical work for him.</item>

<item>a. Well, I was clerk all the way through until I was<lb/>

hospital, but, of course, I don't know exactly when that<lb/>
was built.</item>
</list></item>
<item><add>#11</add> Now, we're back to question 11. What were the attitudes<lb/>
of the doctors and the nurses, the soldiers and the Hospital<lb/>
Corps men when they learned that it was yellow fever?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I don't think there was any particular notice taken of it.<lb/>
I don't think anybody paid much attention -- they just knew it<lb/>
was yellow fever, and that's all. They had so many diseases<lb/>
there that they didn't bother whether it was yellow fever or ...<lb/>
they had smallpox there, and many tropical diseases.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Were there many soldiers that died of yellow fever there?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Yes, there were quite a few.</item>
</list></item>
<item>What do you mean by quite a few?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I couldn't tell you. It kept us busy getting wooden<lb/>
coffins -- the dead house was just piled up.</item>
</list></item>
<item>What do you mean, they kept you busy getting coffins?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Wooden boxes.</item>
</list></item>
<item>You had to go down where? The quartermasters, and bring them up<lb/>
to the hospital?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I suppose so.<lb/>
14.</item>
</list></item>
<pb n="15" id="f04715015"/>
<item>You had to do some of that?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No, I didn't have to -- I saw them there. The reason<lb/>
that's called to my attention, one morning I went down<lb/>
and passed by the dead house early and there was a doctor<lb/>
there, he had a long black beard -- I forget his name<lb/>
(added by Mr. Tate -- his name was Persenol)* and he had<lb/>
been working all night, and he looked tired out, and he was<lb/>
sitting there. He said something to me about -- he put his<lb/>
hands back on those coffins -- and said it was such a shame<lb/>
that those men had to die. And I got an idea that the<lb/>
doctor thought that this was yellow fever and if they had<lb/>
treated them for yellow fever they might not have died.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Now, was there any criticism among the hospital corps, among your-<lb/>
selves, of Dr. Godfrey or the other doctors there?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No. I didn't ever hear any.</item>
</list></item>
<item>The men didn't say, for instance -- &ldquo;if they had only had some<lb/>
intelligent doctors&rdquo; ...<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No. In the Army at that time, you took everything as<lb/>
it came. There wasn't any criticism.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Did you every hear any criticism of Dr. Godfrey later?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No.</item>

<item>When you went over to Camp Columbia, did you ever hear any<lb/>
criticism?<lb/>

<item><hi>Photo 5</hi> - Quartel, Doherty wagon marked with Red Cross standing in front.<lb/>
<add>#13</add> (Mr. Tate) The infantry had Doherty wagons, but not marked with<lb/>
Red Cross, those were ambulances. There was a wall, but the<lb/>
windows were boarded up. Three downstairs windows where the<lb/>
Doherty wagon is, between three arched entrances on the left and two<lb/>
&check; large doors on the left. These three windows were in the <del>Quartel</del><add>Carcel</add>. The<lb/>
one just behind and to the left of the Doherty wagon, with the bars<lb/>
(otherwise unprotected) was in the sentry room.<lb/>
(Mr. Tate replying to a question about distance as indicated<lb/>
in the photo): It was about 20 feet from the outer wall to<lb/>
the inner or courtyard wall. The two windows behind the wagon<lb/>
were the two outer windows of the <del>Quartel</del><add>Carcel</add>. The windows were<lb/>
boarded up and inside there was a board partition between the<lb/>
prisoners and the two windows right behind the wagon, to stop<lb/>
people passing anything in to them such as liquor or knives.<lb/>
There were Army cots in there. The number of cots varied depend-<lb/>
ing on the number of prisoners. There was room for 15 to 20<lb/>
prisoners. They slept here, but during the day, they were worked.<lb/>
The door to the right of the wagon was the door to a corridor.<lb/>
(So far as Mr. Tate knows, this door did not lead directly to the<lb/>
prisoners' room, he always entered through the middle of the<lb/>
three arched gates.) Upstairs were officers' quarters, offices,<lb/>
court martial hearing rooms. The first floor was<lb/>
occupied by some of the infantry ...........<lb/>

<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I arrived Sept 9, 1900 at Columbia Barracks. Went by train.<lb/>
We left in the morning and arrived that night.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Why did you go there?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. The reason we were up there in the first place, after the<lb/>
war there were a lot of bandits in the mountains, on the other<lb/>
side, and they would come up these mountain trails and attack<lb/>
the interior and then go back. The Spanish soldiers could<lb/>
never get them because they couldn't get over those trails and<lb/>
we couldn't get them either until we sent to the United States<lb/>
and got mountain batteries and pack trains and pack mules and<lb/>
went out after them. Then I suppose we wiped all of them out,<lb/>
and with this yellow fever business there was no use in having<lb/>
an army there.</item>

Stark's place and then when Stark came back......Wait a<lb/>
minute, there was somebody after Stark because Stark had<lb/>
a nervous breakdown and left -- and that was shortly before<lb/>
I left, there was someone else in charge for a month or so,<lb/>
I don't know who it was, maybe Major Kean. Major Kean was at<lb/>

<item>Can you give me anything about the personality of Jernegan or Olsen,<lb/>
or any of those people?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Olsen was a very placid disposition, good-natured,<lb/>
competent, and a fine soldier.<lb/>
Morris was a short, fat man, of a very jolly disposition.<lb/>
His funny stories of his imaginary adventures were a source<lb/>
of entertainment to us all. He was always ready for any duty,<lb/>
and though he did a lot of affected growling, performed all<lb/>
his duties well.<lb/>
Harroldson* was a handsome young fellow. Mostly performed<lb/>
nursing duties, and was pleasant and popular.<lb/>
Williamson was a quiet young man. Never took part in any<lb/>
of soldier's vices, such as drinking, gambling, etc. He studied<lb/>
Spanish under an old Castillian in Pinar del Rio who was a<lb/>
Yale graduate. He was respected and liked by all.<lb/>
I don't remember much about De Larue.<lb/>
It was rumored that <hi>Acting Steward Arnold had been a doctor</hi>,<lb/>
but had to give up practice for some reason, and had entered the<lb/>
Hospital Corps. He was a fine gentleman and one of the best-<lb/>
liked non-coms.</item>

<item>How often were you at Camp Lazear?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I was only there one time.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Why were you there?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I used to make sick call at the 7th Cavalry with the<lb/>
doctor every morning and one morning he said he had to go<lb/>
down to Camp Lazear.</item>
</list></item>
<item>What doctor?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. Dr. Amador. On this particular morning he said he had<lb/>
* I think this is spelled<lb/>
differently previously in text.<lb/>
21.<lb/>
<pb n="22" id="f04715022"/>
to go to Camp Lazear so we drove down in the ambulance and<lb/>
stopped at the big oak tree outside the place (Dr. Hench:<lb/>
&ldquo;Here's the oak tree,&rdquo;...to which Mr. Tate replied &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.)<lb/>
He got off and went into one of these tents and he came out<lb/>
again after about five minutes and got in the wagon and<lb/>
that was the only time I was there. It was strictly<lb/>
quarantined.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Do you remember anything about it?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No, just a lot of tents. I didn't even get out of the<lb/>
wagon. I presume he told me -- he was very talktative -- but<lb/>
I have forgotten. I think he went to see Dr. Ames about<lb/>
something.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Did you ever have any dealings with the Los Animas Hospital?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Did you know anything about the yellow fever hospital across the<lb/>
railroad track from the post hospital?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I saw it.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Did you go there often?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. No. One time I took a walk a way out around these buildings.<lb/>
You know there's an argument as to whether there were three huts there,<lb/>
whether there were six, there, or whether there were four or eight?</item>
<item>a. Yes. I have heard that argument. Of course, Lambert was<lb/>
there longer than anybody else and Lambert swears it was four.<lb/>
Let me tell you, there's a map made by the Quartermaster's<lb/>
Department and that's made by surveyors and I've looked at that<lb/>
22.<lb/>
<pb n="23" id="f04715023"/>
map and I know all of this hospital -- every building in it --<lb/>
and they were all according to size and shape and distances<lb/>
apart. Why would those surveyors get all of this exactly<lb/>
accurate and go over there and put in eight buildings if they<lb/>
weren't there? I don't believe it -- I think there were eight<lb/>
buildings there. Lambert was a good fellow and he wouldn't<lb/>
tell a lie, but was, I think, honestly mistaken. When I got<lb/>
there, there were no tents, there were little buildings, but<lb/>
I don't remember how many .... I examined that map with a<lb/>
magnifying glass...it's an official map and absolutely correct.</item>
</list></item>
<item>Why should these surveyors be so accurate about everything else and<lb/>
put in some little yellow fever huts that were never there? On the<lb/>
1902 map there are eight little huts. Mr. Tate says those must have<lb/>
been there in 1900 and 1901 because there was no reason after 1901 to<lb/>
build any more.<lb/>
You remember that little bridge? On the model here, it is here over<lb/>
the railroad tracks, but Lambert thinks it was over here. The<lb/>
hospital is over here (Mr. Tate, &ldquo;yes&rdquo;) and this is the railroad track<lb/>
and here is the laundry or something, and the model shows the bridge<lb/>
in between -- not centered -- but in between. Lambert thinks it was<lb/>
over here. Do you remember? Where did the bridge cross the railroad<lb/>
tracks?<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>a. I'm just trying to remember it. I couldn't say.</item>
<item>Where did the bridge cross the railroad tracks in relation to the<lb/>
two rows of yellow fever huts? According to the Perez model, the<lb/>
bridge crossed the railroad tracks between (though not evenly between)<lb/>
23.<lb/>
<pb n="24" id="f04715024"/>
the two rows of buildings. According to Lambert it crossed to one<lb/>
side of all of the buildings.</item>
<item>a. I don't know. (I've got an idea, but I wouldn't say it.)<lb/>
You can't identify any of these buildings of your own knowledge?</item>
<item>a. No.</item>
</list></item>
