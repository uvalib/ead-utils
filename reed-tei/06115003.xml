<title>Letter from Philip Showalter Hench to Laura Wood, July 1, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Hench responds to Wood's letter, in which she informed him of her project to write the story of Walter Reed for children. He discusses his two chief discoveries: that Lazear probably was bitten deliberately and secretly, and the location of Camp Lazear. He is sending her two of his manuscripts and offers copies of some of his material. He suggests she contact Emilie Lawrence Reed.</p>

Miss Laura Wood<lb/>
1338 Nineteenth St. N. W.<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Miss Wood:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am very interested in your letter telling of your project to<lb/>
write the story of Walter Reed and the conquest of yellow fever for children.<lb/>
I agree with you that this certainly does not conflict with my own efforts to<lb/>
publish a longer and more detailed story for adults. I have spent four years<lb/>
collecting data and by good fortune have <unclear>unearthed</unclear> a good amount of unpublished<lb/>
material. My two chief discoveries are that Lazear was in all probability not<lb/>
bitten accidentally but deliberately and secretly, and secondly, Camp Lazear,<lb/>
where the work was done was lost for forty years, and Moran and I discovered it<lb/>
last Fall. I have bought the little Building No. 1 which still remains and hope<lb/>
to have it memorialized properly.</p>
<p>I am sending you by separate post two manuscripts which I have<lb/>
already given. The one given on the occasion of the dedication of the Lazear Mem-<lb/>
orial at Washington and Jefferson College, was published in their brochure &ldquo;A<lb/>
Mile Post&rdquo;. It has not been published elsewhere as yet. The other was given last<lb/>
month at the unveiling of the Cornwell painting at the A. M. A. We hope to pub-<lb/>
lish this in Hygeia or elsewhere shortly. You are at liberty to quote this mater-<lb/>
ial and I would appreciate your referring to my original articles.</p>
<p>Dr. Kelly gave me a great amount of material. Much of it is of<lb/>
such a nature that I believe it would be entirely useless for your purpose in<lb/>
writing a children's book, but some of it is of interest. However, there were<lb/>
only two letters from Walter Reed therein and a couple of copies of letters from<lb/>
Walter Reed to others. There were a couple of Agramonte's letters and a dozen or<lb/>
two of Carroll's letters, the latter unfortunately mostly concerning his hurt<lb/>
feelings that he had not been done justice. They in spots stirred up the contro-<lb/>
versy as to who was the most important worker. It would seem that a thorough<lb/>
appraisal of this controversy would be more my job than yours, in a book for<lb/>
children. You are more interested in the straight story. I believe the best<lb/>
help that you can get would be from Miss Blossom Reed, Walter Reed's daughter.<lb/>
Her address is Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania. In Cleveland last months, she<lb/>
showed me a manuscript which she had prepared and sent two or three places for<lb/>
publication. It is a collection of letters from her father to her mother, beginning<lb/>
even before their engagement to be married. It illustrates beautifully his char-<lb/>
acter and adventures. Unfortunately, the letters of the Cuban period are very in-<lb/>
complete as Mrs. Reed gave many of <unclear>those</unclear> away to various institutions and did not<lb/>
make copies of them. Miss Reed permitted me to make some notes from this manuscript<lb/>
but of course you would probably want to see the complete letters. I suspect that<lb/>
she would let you make notes from this material, but in all fairness to her, I doubt<lb/>

Miss Laura Wood<lb/>

that she would want you to use this material extensively as she is still trying<lb/>
to publish it, and in confidence I might say that she feels she needs the money<lb/>
which she might get from the publication, and we outsiders have no right to feel<lb/>
that we should interfere with that. I am taking the liberty of asking General<lb/>
Kean for his permission to let me send you copies of a few letters that he has<lb/>
given me--letters of Agramonte and Reed. Since you suggested it, I will also<lb/>
write General Reed and Miss Hoke.</p>
<p>What do you wish me to do--have carbon copies or photostats made<lb/>
of these various letters? The Clinic is extremely busy and will be so for the<lb/>
next four months. This is our busiest season, as you can well imagine when I<lb/>
tell you that over a thousand patients came in one day this week. Therefore, our<lb/>
photographic department and my own secretary are working at full speed and I<lb/>
regret that I cannot ask them to copy this material in hours. We would have to<lb/>
make some arrangement to have it copied out of hours, either by a stenographer<lb/>
or have it photostated out of hours as a private project by one of the men in our<lb/>
photographic department. Doubtless, this can be done, and if you wish me to<lb/>
arrange it, I will try to figure out how much it might cost.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
