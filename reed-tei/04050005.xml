<p>FORGOTTEN CORNER</p>
<p>In a corner of the unsightly district of &ldquo;Pogolotti&rdquo;, at the foot of an<lb/>
abandoned quarry, there stands almost in ruins, due to the action of time, the last<lb/>
vestige of what in a distant epoch was a hospital or more correctly speaking what was<lb/>
called &ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo; where were carried out certain experiments of the most important<lb/>
realized in the field of medicine: the confirmation of the theories of our great Carlos<lb/>
Finlay about the transmission of yellow fever by the culex mosquito.</p>
<p>To carry out such experiments there were constructed two small wooden shacks,<lb/>
14 x 20 feet, with two windows, respectively. The first was designated &ldquo;Building No. 1&rdquo;<lb/>
or &ldquo;The Infected Clothing Building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this building, where were accumulated clothing used by the victims of the<lb/>
disease, there slept for many days (nights) Dr. Robert Cooke and six other volunteers,<lb/>
doing so on pillows contaminated with blood and vomit of yellow fever patients. None<lb/>
of the volunteers contracted the disease, hence the Sanarelli theory which affirmed<lb/>
that yellow fever was transmitted by &ldquo;fomes&rdquo; was discarded.</p>
<p>The second, designated &ldquo;Building No. 2&rdquo; or &ldquo;Infected Mosquito Building&rdquo; was<lb/>
divided in two parts, separated by a fine-meshed wire screen. On one side reclined Mr.<lb/>
John Moran with his body exposed to the bites of fifteen mosquitos which were set free<lb/>
in the room. The stay there of Mr. Moran, a little more than an hour, resulted in his<lb/>
contracting the disease, while other volunteers who remained <hi>several hours</hi> on the other<lb/>
side of the metallic curtain, where there were no mosquitos, remained healthy.</p>
<p>Following these incontrovertible proofs more were realized in which American<lb/>
and Spanish volunteers submitted themselves, on the termination of which Camp Lazear<lb/>
was abandoned, leading to a start in 1901 by General Gorgas of his famous campaign of<lb/>
sanitation, the fruits of which became evident with the disappearance from our land of<lb/>
yellow fever and rendering possible the hitherto impossible task of building the<lb/>
Panama Canal.</p>
<p>Today, we take pleasure in presenting a photograph of &ldquo;Building No. 1&rdquo;, which<lb/>
may be the last since the abandoned state of same tends to deteriorate more each day<lb/>
its dilapidated walls. Since our visit last year the porch has disappeared and it seems<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04050006"/>
2.<lb/>
that this destruction runs on a par with our forgetfulness of those things of historic<lb/>
and scientific value which should be preserved for the glory of our illustrious country-<lb/>
men who gave lustre to our country with the guerdon of their wisdom and good works.</p>
<p>The distinguished North American doctor, Phil S. Hench, enthusiastic admirer<lb/>
of Finley's work, discovered this building in 1941 and thanks to his generosity, certain<lb/>
small reparations were made to same although upon destroying the porch, the person in<lb/>
whose charge the repairs were made changed somewhat the original aspect of &ldquo;Building<lb/>
No. 1&rdquo; of Camp Lazear.</p>
<p>In another of the photographs we present can be seen Mr. John Moran, one of<lb/>
the survivors of that notable episode, who has lived amongst us since that memorable<lb/>
day and who so kindly furnished the data which has served us as a basis for this brief<lb/>
review.</p>
<p><hi>Notes for Col. Hench:</hi></p>
<p>As the Colonel is well aware, &ldquo;Building No. 1&rdquo; did not originally have a<lb/>
porch. It had a narrow vestibule which must have disappeared years ago. An effort<lb/>
was made to repair the narrow porch, none the less, but the supports and boards had<lb/>
rotted so much that, short of employing new lumber, it was considered the better part<lb/>
of wisdom to remove it altogether rather than to have it collapse and injure one of<lb/>
the occupants when and as it might give way. With its destruction no part of the<lb/>
original building was involved.</p>
