Mr. J. L. Hanberry<lb/>
Orangeburg<lb/>
South Carolina<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Hanberry:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You must think me a most uncooperative individual but the truth is that<lb/>
I have been just too busy this spring for my own good. I finally got the time to<lb/>
have the photostats made and I am sending them to you by separate post, registered<lb/>
mail. They include the snapshots which I took of you and your grandson, some nice<lb/>
large photographs showing all of us on the platform at the meeting in Washington,<lb/>
a couple of large photographs showing you taking a bow with General Reed beside<lb/>
you, two photostatic positives and a photostatic negative of your fever chart<lb/>
and some other items which I think you will enjoy. I am returning all of your<lb/>
newspaper clippings and with most of them I am sending you for you to keep a nega-<lb/>
tive photostat so that when anyone else asks you to borrow your clippings you will<lb/>
not have to send them the originals.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate it if you would tell me from what paper and<lb/>
about what date the following clippings were taken. I am sending a copy of this<lb/>
letter so that you can just write after each heading what paper you think it is<lb/>
from.<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. Clipping about Pinto's death.</item>
<item>2. Clipping about Kissinger's death.</item>
<item>3. Sontag's death. (Was his name spelled with two n's or one?<lb/>
I have seen it both ways.)</item>
<item>4. Clipping about Folk's death. (I think this was the New York<lb/>
Times, 1936, probably the 10th of February.)</item>
<item>5. &ldquo;Yellow fever cause a war development&rdquo; etc.</item>
<item>6. &ldquo;Hero of Peace Crosses River&rdquo;.</item>
<item>7. &ldquo;Three Carolinians&rdquo;</item>
<item>8. &ldquo;Arlington Funeral&rdquo; etc.</item>
</list></p>
<p>I am sending you a photostat of a clipping entitled &ldquo;Due Recognition<lb/>
Shown&rdquo; etc. I had this clipping in my folder and I didn't know whether you had<lb/>
given it to me but I believe you did not because it was already stamped &ldquo;From<lb/>
Gust Lambert&rdquo; and that is the type of rubber stamp I have made for each man who<lb/>
loans me or give me any clippings. I assume you have seen it but since you<lb/>
didn't have it with your own clippings, I am sending you a positive photostat.<lb/>
If, however, the original clipping is yours, please return the photostat and I<lb/>
will send you the original.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you want more of the large photos taken at the<lb/>
Congress in Washington, I think you could probably get them by writing Mr.<lb/>
Frank Standley, Office of Press Relations, Department of State, Washington, D. C.<lb/>

They sent me a list of the photos taken at the Congress. The one of us on the<lb/>
platform is 1376-88. The one of you standing up is 1376-93. In the identifi-<lb/>
cation list which they sent me they didn't have the names quite correct. For<lb/>
example, they identified General Reed as General Truby in the picture with you<lb/>
and made the same mistake in the picture on the platform. I shall be glad<lb/>
to know if these reach you safely.</p>
<p>Please give my best to your grandson.</p>
