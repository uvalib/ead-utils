<p>Army &amp; Navy Journal Dec 14 1901.</p>
<p>A CANDIDATE FOR HONORS.</p>
<p>To the Editor of the ARMY AND NAVY JOURNAL:</p>
<p>Much of the elan and spirit of the French Revolu-<lb/>
tionary armies has been ascribed to the fact that every<lb/>
soldier felt that the Marshal's baton might be reposing<lb/>
at the bottom of his knapsack. This feeling has already<lb/>
been produced to no small extent in the staff corps<lb/>
of the Army by the remarkable leap to the head of his<lb/>
corps of Captain Crozier, of the Ordnance--a promo-<lb/>
tion which has been generally announced as the first<lb/>
step of a policy of &ldquo;revitalizing&rdquo; the staff corps. In the<lb/>
Medical Corps especially, which has its full share of<lb/>
able and ambitious officers, and for which a new head<lb/>
has to be selected in the next half-year, there is quite<lb/>
a wide-spread stimulation of ambitions and a tendency<lb/>
to search knapsacks for a concealed baton.</p>
<p>Among a dozen names which are now being mentioned<lb/>
in connection with the Surgeon-Generalcy, it is claimed<lb/>
by the friends of Major Walter Reed that his name<lb/>
should stand first on the list of the men who have done<lb/>
things. It is, in fact, impossible to match in the annals<lb/>
of the Medical Corps of our military Services, or even<lb/>
perhaps in those of the medical profession in America,<lb/>
a performance of such vast and far-reaching import-<lb/>
ance as the demonstration last year by Dr. Reed of the<lb/>
transmission of the yellow fever by the mosquito. Pro-<lb/>
fessor Welch, of Johns Hopkins, who is probably the<lb/>
leading pathologist of America, has already announced<lb/>
that no event in medical history so important to man-<lb/>
kind has occurred since the discovery of vaccination.<lb/>
General Wood is said to have stated that it is worth to<lb/>
the United States the cost of the Spanish-American<lb/>
War. If this be a just measure of the value of this<lb/>
discovery--and certainly in such a matter there are<lb/>
few better judges than General Wood--it would seem<lb/>
that among many officers to whom the war has brought<lb/>
the general's stars, Major Reed should have a place.</p>
<p>Major Reed is now in the prime of life, being forty-<lb/>
eight years of age, and is nearing the head of the list<lb/>
of majors in his corps. His name was well known<lb/>
among scientific and professional men before his work<lb/>
of last year made him famous. His investigation in<lb/>
connection with Dr. Victor C. Vaughn, of Ann Arbor,<lb/>
and Dr. Shakespeare, of Philadelphia, of the causes of<lb/>
the spread of typhoid fever in military camps in 1898<lb/>
was a work of immense labor and most enlightening<lb/>
results, and would, in another country, have been cer-<lb/>
tain to have brought him some reward.</p>
<p>If the rule of the future is to be that promotion will<lb/>
be for results accomplished, rather than for length of<lb/>
service, it would seem that the claims of Major Reed<lb/>
could not be overlooked.</p>
<p>SURGEON.</p>
