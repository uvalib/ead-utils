<dateline>
At sea, off the<lb/>
Jersey Coast,<lb/>
Thursday 4 P.M.<lb/>
</dateline>
<hi>No. 5.<lb/>
Effort no. 1</hi><lb/>
<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>As I told<lb/>
you and dear little piano -<lb/>
player that you might think<lb/>
of me on Thursday evening as<lb/>
the sickest dog &ldquo;in the bunch&rdquo;,<lb/>
I now want to tell you how<lb/>
splendidly I have made out<lb/>
thus far. We left N.Y. at 10<lb/>
a.m.-little daughter's letter-<lb/>
&amp; your package containing my<lb/>
overcoat having arrived<lb/>
about 10 minutes before<lb/>
the Sedgewick hauled out from<lb/>
her dock- I was really very<lb/>
glad to have received them<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02039002"/>
<hi>both</hi>, but it was a very<lb/>
close shave! It was very,<lb/>
very sweet in my dear wifie<lb/>
to have sent the coat &amp; very<lb/>
good &amp; sweet in our little bird=<lb/>
trainer to have written to her<lb/>
Papa- The overcoat comes in<lb/>
so handy, for without it, I<lb/>
couldn't have sat on the deck<lb/>
to-night - Just to think that I<lb/>
haven't been sick a bit, this<lb/>
time- It's true the sea is quick<lb/>
but the vessel moves consid-<lb/>
erably nevertheless, but I don't<lb/>
mind it a bit - After lunch<lb/>
which was very appetizing,<lb/>
I slept from 2 till 5.30 P.M.<lb/>
&amp; then ate a very hearty<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02039003"/>
dinner- The fare is very good<lb/>
and Dr Carroll &amp; I have the<lb/>
best state-room on the ship,<lb/>
because I happen to be the<lb/>
ranking officer aboard- It<lb/>
seems that state-rooms go<lb/>
by <hi>rank</hi>. There are several<lb/>
officers aboard - Major Peter-<lb/>
sen of the Commissary Dep't,<lb/>
Major <unclear>Dunn</unclear> &amp; wife, of the<lb/>
Judge advocates Dep't. and<lb/>
Lt. Wilcox. I expect to enjoy<lb/>
the trip very much, as the<lb/>
bromide appears to be doing<lb/>
its work beautifully- I so much<lb/>
wish that my precious ba-<lb/>
bies knew that their fat<lb/>
mantee wasn't sick- Indeed<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02039004"/>
I wish that I had a quart of<lb/>
Keewaydin strawberries this<lb/>
very minute; I could eat them<lb/>
every one! Whether my appe-<lb/>
tite will be so voracious by<lb/>
this time Friday evening, I don't<lb/>
know, but I have every<lb/>
expectation of being in good<lb/>
shape- The Sedgwick is at<lb/>
5 000 tons &amp; was formerly<lb/>
the City of Chester of the<lb/>
<unclear>Inman</unclear> line - She is a first<lb/>
class boat &amp; quite fast.<lb/>
Good-night, you pea and straw<lb/>
berry<del>es</del> Consumers! For my-<lb/>
self, I am getting <hi>sleepy</hi>-<lb/>
Boo! Boo -- a kiss for<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi>Tootsey</hi>&rdquo;! What a name<lb/>
for a puppy -!</p>
<pb n="5" id="f02039005"/>
<p><hi>Effort No. 2</hi></p>
<p>A little North of<lb/>
Jupiter Inlet-<lb/>
Florida Coast-<lb/>
<del>Saturday</del><add>Sunday</add> 11 a.m.</p>
<p>My darling children can see<lb/>
that there is something of a<lb/>
gap between my first attempt at<lb/>
writing &amp; this my second - It<lb/>
hasn't been altogether due to<lb/>
seasickness &amp; yet the latter has<lb/>
had something to do with it -<lb/>
Although Friday was rough, ac-<lb/>
cording to my standard, yet I<lb/>
never felt better- Took my bro-<lb/>
mide and went to my three meals<lb/>
&amp; enjoyed them very much - Friday<lb/>
evening, I promenaded the deck<lb/>
for an hour with the Captain<lb/>
although the boat was<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02039006"/>
pitching a good deal- Indeed, I<lb/>
couldn't understand my good<lb/>
feeling at <hi>all</hi>- When I retired<lb/>
to my stateroom at 9 o'clock,<lb/>
I found that Dr Carroll had<lb/>
given up the fight &amp; surren-<lb/>
dered to the elements - I sup-<lb/>
pose that his example had<lb/>
some effect on me, for I<lb/>
soon found that it would<lb/>
be wise policy to <del>re</del>turn<lb/>
in as soon as possible-<lb/>
Saturday morning when I awoke,<lb/>
there was a sensation of<lb/>
two or three <hi>tons</hi> of <hi>brick</hi><lb/>
in the region of the stomach &amp;<lb/>
an entire loss of appitite.<lb/>
The boat was rolling and<lb/>
the orange that I ate soon<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02039007"/>
began to <hi>roll</hi>, too, until it<lb/>
<hi>rolled out</hi>! This will ac-<lb/>
count for my failure to add<lb/>
any to my letter on Friday evening,<lb/>
as I had intended, or on Saturday-<lb/>
Indeed I staid in my berth all<lb/>
day yesterday - read some, slept<lb/>
more &amp; &ldquo;fed the fishes&rdquo; as occasion<lb/>
seemed to require! Still the day<lb/>
wasn't, all things taken, a very dis-<lb/>
agreeable one- This morning, I have<lb/>
had an orange, a cup of black<lb/>
coffee &amp; a piece of dry toast,-have<lb/>
taken a good sponge bath, put<lb/>
on thinner underwear, &amp; have come<lb/>
on deck to enjoy the delightful<lb/>
breeze - am feeling very well,<lb/>
all things considered and think<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02039008"/>
that I can make out very well till<lb/>
tomorrow, when we reach Havana.<lb/>
At 8.30 this morning, I thought of<lb/>
my babies sitting down to break-<lb/>
fast and oh! how I did want some<lb/>
of those fresh strawberries! For I<lb/>
imagine that you picked some just<lb/>
before breakfast- I hope that you<lb/>
didn't spoil them by putting sugar<lb/>
on them! and Oh! for just one cup<lb/>
of that good coffee! and a taste<lb/>
of <hi>those cabbage</hi>! I should be<lb/>
well immediately. Do write &amp; tell<lb/>
me how the things grow, both<lb/>
flowers &amp; vegetables, for I shall<lb/>
take such interest in them- I<lb/>
can almost hear little joy playing<lb/>
on her piano- Bless your<lb/>
darling hearts, how I shall look<lb/>
forward to seeing you in August!</p>
<pb n="9" id="f02039009"/>
<p><hi>Effort no. 3</hi>.</p>
<p>Sunday 1 P.M.</p>
<p>We are now skirting along the<lb/>
Florida Coast, running parallel<lb/>
at a distance of about two<lb/>
miles - you can hardly imagine<lb/>
how refreshing the sight of the beach<lb/>
and the foliage is, after 48 hours<lb/>
at sea. The strip of green, seen<lb/>
over the water, is so pleasant<lb/>
a prospect - just now we came<lb/>
abreast of Palm Beach Hotel<lb/>
and the Royal Ponciana, on<lb/>
Lake North - with Dr Carroll's<lb/>
opera glasses, I could see every<lb/>
part of the buildings &amp; cottages<lb/>
perfectly- Some winter we<lb/>
must come down &amp; enjoy the<lb/>
climate &amp; beach - nestling here<lb/>
and there amongst the pines<lb/>
I can see many pretty homes.<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02039010"/>
Twice, this morning, we have<lb/>
seen a beautiful <add>rain</add> passing up<lb/>
the coast just parallel with the<lb/>
shore, and each time have felt<lb/>
its refreshing coolness- The<lb/>
weather, by the way, has thus<lb/>
far been delightful - not at<lb/>
all warm. We are now<lb/>
scudding along at a 15 knot<lb/>
rate with a most delight-<lb/>
ful breeze fanning our cheeks.<lb/>
The Gong has sounded for<lb/>
lunch, but I won't go <add>down</add>.<lb/>
I don't feel a particle sick,<lb/>
and for that very reason I<lb/>
will have my lunch served<lb/>
on deck, for I am afraid that<lb/>
the sight of so much food and the<lb/>
odor of the ship would turn me<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f02039011"/>
up side down. How dear little<lb/>
daughter would enjoy seeing the<lb/>
schools of flying fish, as they<lb/>
suddenly rise out of the water<lb/>
and go hurrying along, appa-<lb/>
rently to get rid of the ship-<lb/>
we are continually seeing them-<lb/>
Thursday afternoon a school<lb/>
of porpoises made sport for<lb/>
us for quite a while, as<lb/>
they went rolling and diving and<lb/>
chasing after each other.<lb/>
I wonder whether you are<lb/>
enjoying as delightful a<lb/>
breeze at dear Keewaydin<lb/>
as we are now having -<lb/>
Tell daughter that as I write<lb/>
the Captain's little Fox-terrier<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f02039012"/>
stands and gazes wishfully at<lb/>
me, as if she wanted to get into<lb/>
my lap- She reminds me very<lb/>
much of &ldquo;Tootsey&rdquo; - Why didn't<lb/>
cousin Annie name that pup<lb/>
&ldquo;Wootsey&rdquo;? or better still &ldquo;Toot-<lb/>
sey - Wootsey&rdquo;? Isn't it nice<lb/>
that auntie is coming up so<lb/>
soon? Has Mary come over<lb/>
yet? Did Mr Moore conclude<lb/>
to take the pony? Dear me,<lb/>
I will have to bring this<lb/>
letter to a close or else I<lb/>
won't have any thing to put<lb/>
in the next one- I'll try to fin-<lb/>
ish it just before we reach<lb/>
Havana &amp; then mail it promptly<lb/>
so that you can get it by Thursday.</p>
<pb n="13" id="f02039013"/>
<p>Effort no. 4 -</p>
<p>Not quite in sight<lb/>
of Cuba, Monday Morning,<lb/>
7.30 o'clock-</p>
<p>Well, sweetest children on earth,<lb/>
here is your old Mr Mantee<lb/>
up at this hour on the Saloon<lb/>
deck, after having sucked a lemon<lb/>
dry, swallowed a glass of cracked<lb/>
ice, and shaved himself in the<lb/>
most approved style. What do<lb/>
you think of such an outburst<lb/>
of energy? Pretty good for a<lb/>
man who isn't much of a sailor?<lb/>
The day passed off beautifully<lb/>
yesterday - delicious breezes,<lb/>
slightly clouded skies, and the fringe<lb/>
of green, on our starboard<lb/>
side, of Florida's Coast- We<lb/>
did not leave it till late<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f02039014"/>
in the afternoon, and even after<lb/>
night came on we still saw<lb/>
its light-houses, so that I didn't<lb/>
feel very far from dear Kee-<lb/>
waydin and its precious in-<lb/>
habitants - we sat on deck<lb/>
till 10.30 P.M.: saw a steamer<lb/>
with all lights set making for<lb/>
a northern port, on the one<lb/>
side, and a U.S. Revenue<lb/>
Cutter, with her big search<lb/>
light, on the other, looking for<lb/>
smugglers along the Florida<lb/>
Keys -- I then went below &amp;<lb/>
by means of an Electric Fan<lb/>
and a wind-scoop in each of<lb/>
our two port- holes, managed<lb/>
to woo a good breeze<lb/>
<pb n="15" id="f02039015"/>
which stayed with us the whole<lb/>
night, so that we slept well<lb/>
&amp; both feel refreshed, this<lb/>
morning- The sea is still<lb/>
very quiet, so that there is<lb/>
no motion hardly to<del>o</del> the big<lb/>
ship- I shall certainly select<lb/>
her for my return trip.</p>
<p>The weather is warmer than<lb/>
at our dear little mountain<lb/>
home, and I expect that we<lb/>
will find it still warmer<lb/>
when we reach the shore.<lb/>
We expect to enter the Harbor<lb/>
about 10 a.m. &amp; I am so<lb/>
anxious to get my letter in<lb/>
the 12 o'clock mail, in which<lb/>
case my darling wifie &amp; daughter<lb/>
<pb n="16" id="f02039016"/>
would get this by Thursday<lb/>
Evening- How is everything at<lb/>
dear Keewaydin this bright morn-<lb/>
ing? I hope very well and<lb/>
happy- I know that the straw-<lb/>
berries must be at their best,<lb/>
and that the pansies &amp; astors<lb/>
are just booming - I would give<lb/>
a dollar for a gourd of that<lb/>
delicious water! <hi>9.15 a.m-</hi><lb/>
Moro Castle is just sighted, so that<lb/>
we will be at anchor about 11 a.m.<lb/>
The Cuban Coast is looming up<lb/>
very prettily &amp; I must bring my<lb/>
effort to a close. We will re-<lb/>
port to Gen. Wood, this forenoon,<lb/>
&amp; then go out to Quemados, this after-<lb/>
noon- Am very well- Love and a<lb/>
thousand kisses for my precious strawberry<lb/>
picker &amp; piano-player.</p>
