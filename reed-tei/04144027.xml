<p>Nogueira informs Hench of the Cuban government's plans to place plaques on Camp Lazear Building No. 1 and on the Havana building where Finlay conducted his experiments, in 1881. He hopes action will be taken on Hench's proposals to preserve the Camp Lazear building soon, and promises to support those efforts.</p>

Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>
c/o Dr. George K. Strode,<lb/>
Rockefeller Foundation<lb/>
International Health Division,<lb/>

New York, N. Y. - (U.S.A.).<lb/>
Dear Doctor Hench:</p>
<p>In accordance with my letter of the 10th inst. I am writing these<lb/>
lines to give you the details in regard to Camp LaZear.</p>
<p>Yesterday I held an interview with Doctor Andrew, who informed me<lb/>
that the delay is due to the fact that the President of the Republic is interest-<lb/>
ed in placing a plaque on the structure remaining at the San Jose farm, and also<lb/>
on the building at Prado 52, where Finlay carried out the first innoculations on<lb/>
the soldiers granted by the Marques of Pena Plata, Don Ramon Blanco, in 1881.<lb/>
This was agreed by the Council of Ministers held on the 12th of this month, as<lb/>
was also ratified the resolution of considering the shack identified by you as a<lb/>
National Monument.</p>
<p>I trust that something will be done now to carry out the plan you<lb/>
proposed, or a similar one, for as nothing had been definitely agreed, it did<lb/>
not seem that any steps would be taken. I am in hopes that the work will be done,<lb/>
and although I am no longer in the past of Director of Sanitation, to which I<lb/>
resigned in the month of June, this shall not be an obstacle to my continuing to<lb/>
be concerned in a matter which has always been of interest to me, and also be-<lb/>
cause of my desire to cooperate in your project to honor that valient and en-<lb/>
thusiastic group of men who erased from the world the fearful threat of yellow<lb/>
fever.</p>
<p>Next month will be the anniversary of Doctor Finlay birthday, which<lb/>
as you know is celebrated by different acts in his honor, as well as of the other<lb/>
members of the Commission and other great scientists of America; for on December 3,<lb/>
in addition to honoring Finlay, we celebrate the day of American Medicine, approv-<lb/>
ed by the Congress held at Dallas, Texas, in 1933, and also Doctor's Day by initia-<lb/>
tive of a Cuban journalist. I trust that from this occasion will arise the com-<lb/>
bined effort to bring your project to a culmination, and from any angle that<lb/>
circumstances may place me in this matter, you may count on my most decided cooper-<lb/>
ation.</p>
<p>From time to time I shall inform you of the course of developments,<lb/>
and I have also suggested to Doctor Andreu that he write you in this connection,<lb/>
which I hope he will not delay in doing.</p>
<p>Until very shortly then, Doctor Hench, and in the meantime I remain,</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Dr. Pedro Nogueira</p>
