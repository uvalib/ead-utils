<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Since I last wrote<lb/>
I have done quite a number of things.<lb/>
First I will tell about my work.<lb/>
I think I have told you that we<lb/>
have been doing two different<lb/>
courses. One for junior students or<lb/>
those who have had only one winter<lb/>
in Anatomy. This is the class to which<lb/>
we all really belong and the course<lb/>
consisted in dissections with<lb/>
examinations on the work of the<lb/>
week each Saturday morning.<lb/>
The other course is for students who<lb/>
have had two winters anatomy.<lb/>
This course consisted in lectures<lb/>
demonstrations and examinations<lb/>
every week or two, altogether covering<lb/>
the anatomy of the whole body.<lb/>
So in this last course I have been<lb/>
over the whole subject in the course<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00144002"/>
of the seven weeks that I have been<lb/>
here.</p>
<p>There are two prizes given in each<lb/>
of these courses. In the Junior course,<lb/>
at the end of the series of examinations<lb/>
there were ten of us who had missed<lb/>
no questions in any of the examinations.<lb/>
Norris, Nicoll, and I were among the ten<lb/>
and besides there was. Knapp who<lb/>
is a New Yorker and a son of one<lb/>
of the professors at College of Phys. &amp; Surg.<lb/>
This afternoon we went up to be<lb/>
examined to see which two of us<lb/>
should get the prizes. It was an<lb/>
oral examination and whenever<lb/>
a man missed a question he<lb/>
dropped out. Finally all dropped out<lb/>
except Knapp, an Englishman, and<lb/>
myself. We three then kept on for a<lb/>
while and at last the professor<lb/>
said that he could not decide<lb/>
between us, but he would try to get<lb/>
the authorities to grant three prizes<lb/>
instead of two.</p>
<p>In the third year course the contest<lb/>
is not yet decided but a New Yorker<lb/>
named Leaming will probably stand<lb/>
first. In this course I have only<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00144003"/>
missed one question but that will be<lb/>
enough to beat me as Leaming<lb/>
has not missed any. However<lb/>
I am very <add>well</add> satisfied to get one prize.<lb/>
I look on the last seven weeks<lb/>
as the most profitable that I have<lb/>
ever spent in my life. I feel that<lb/>
I have now a very good general<lb/>
idea of the whole subject of anatomy.<lb/>
On last Saturday afternoon Norris and<lb/>
I went down to Roslin. We visited<lb/>
the famous chapel. It is indeed a<lb/>
gem. We then went to Roslin Castle<lb/>
and from there we walked along<lb/>
the banks of the Esk to Hawthordon<lb/>
Castle and from there to Lasswade<lb/>
where we took the train back to<lb/>
Edinburgh. The walk along the Esk<lb/>
was through a glen that has been<lb/>
much written about by poets.</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoon we walked down<lb/>
to Leith which is the port of Edinburgh<lb/>
and took a boat ride to the Forth<lb/>
Bridge. This is the magnificent<lb/>
railroad bridge over the Firth of<lb/>
Forth which has just been finished<lb/>
costing <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>15,000,000. This afternoon we<lb/>
visited Holyrood Palace and saw<lb/>
all the curiosities there including<lb/>
the ballroom picture gallery Queen<lb/>
Mary's and Damley's apartments.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f00144004"/>
<p>The best thing about Holyrood is the<lb/>
old chapel which adjoins it. It is<lb/>
in ruins but its architecture is<lb/>
remarkably beautiful.</p>
<p>I am afraid that I cannot get off<lb/>
on Friday as I had expected. I will<lb/>
have to stay here until Thursday when<lb/>
the prizes are distributed and I am<lb/>
very anxious to take a little trip<lb/>
among the Lakes. I also want to<lb/>
spend a day at Glasgow. I will<lb/>
probably go to the lakes on Friday<lb/>
getting to Glasgow that night. I will<lb/>
stay there over night and the next<lb/>
day and return to Edinburgh,<lb/>
Saturday night and go to London on<lb/>
Monday. I have not yet definitely<lb/>
settled about my trip to Germany<lb/>
so you had better direct letters to<lb/>
London until I know more, and<lb/>
I will have them forwarded.<lb/>
Direct them to Paris as I said, for two<lb/>
weeks for I shall certainly go there<lb/>
from London but after that direct<lb/>
to London.</p>
<p>Your letter of July 3 came on Monday morning<lb/>
and I enjoyed it very much. Your<lb/>
letters have come regularly two every<lb/>
week and I am very glad you have<lb/>
written so regularly. I would have<lb/>
felt lost if one did not come on<lb/>
every mail I am glad to hear that<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00144005"/>
the Lyons have consented to May's<lb/>
marrying in December. You say<lb/>
that you have told me why Jane<lb/>
Bowman comes to Pittsburgh so<lb/>
often. You have not told me.<lb/>
I also received your enclosed<lb/>
letter from Mrs. Bowman and<lb/>
the papers both of which I enjoyed.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that Mrs. Miller is not<lb/>
well. She is remarkably strong for her age<lb/>
but she ought to be careful of herself.</p>
<p><del>Satur</del> Wednesday</p>
<p>Norris and I went to the Royal Institution<lb/>
and Art Galleries this morning. There<lb/>
are some good pictures, a Landseer,<lb/>
a Gainsborough and three Van Dykes.<lb/>
We also went to Greyfriars and after-<lb/>
wards saw an operation by Dr. Duncan.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
