<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was pleased to get your letter of September 1 enclosing the<lb/>
copy of Walter Reed's New Years Eve letter to his wife in 1900. I<lb/>
was also very much pleased to see the photograph of the group around<lb/>
the ambulance at Camp Lazear. That was very familiar to me. I am<lb/>
returning the photograph with remarks on the back of it. No. 2 is<lb/>
certainly Dr. Cooke. I am quite sure that No. 3 is Jernegan. No. 4<lb/>
is, I am quite sure, acting steward, Kissinger. Notice his chevrons.<lb/>
The picture certainly looks exactly like Kissinger's outline and is<lb/>
not at all like the two other acting stewards we had in Cuba. No. 6<lb/>
is evidently a young officer in a blue flannel shirt and officer's<lb/>
blue uniform cap. I have no idea who it is. After studying this<lb/>
photograph a long time, I am almost certain that No. 7 is Walter<lb/>
Reed himself, although I never saw Walter Reed wear civilian clothes<lb/>
in Cuba. This was evidently one of those cold days there when woolen<lb/>
uniforms felt comfortable. If that is Kissinger in the picture, it<lb/>
means that this photograph was taken late in December or in January,<lb/>
for Kissinger was promoted after his attack of Yellow Fever. Reed<lb/>
probably had no blue uniforms with him but had civilian clothes to<lb/>
wear after he left the boat in New York on his way to Washington.<lb/>
The three men (No. 10) look exactly like the Spanish volunteers. The<lb/>
boys were evidently their friends who could visit them at that place.<lb/>
I hope you will get Dr. Cooke to express his views and you should al-<lb/>
so ask the Reed family if No. 7 is really Reed.</p>
