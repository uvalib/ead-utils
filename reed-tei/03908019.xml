<salute>Dr. Hen<del>s</del>ch -</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you so much for your<lb/>
prompt reply to my plea of a few<lb/>
days ago. What I hope to do can be<lb/>
told in a few words. Some years<lb/>
ago I read Mrs. Gorgas's story of the Dr.<lb/>
(her husband) and his work. Of course,<lb/>
you have read it too and what it<lb/>
tells of the Commission and their<lb/>
work.</p>
<p><unclear>At once</unclear> I felt I should like to have<lb/>
a brief biography of each member of<lb/>
the Commission also of Dr. Finlay<lb/>
Dr. Carter &amp; Dr. Gorgas just to know<lb/>
something of their history back of their<lb/>
world in the conquest.</p>
<p>So I set to work <unclear>writing</unclear> up such<lb/>
history. just between times when I<lb/>
am at home- I am a nurse- not<lb/>
a graduate to my regret but trained<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03908020"/>
2.<lb/>
in our N. H. D. V. S. at a time when they<lb/>
trained nurses. After three years not<lb/>
having anyone to turn to for a nickel<lb/>
I had to perforce use my training to<lb/>
earn a living. For recreation and<lb/>
diversion in the years I work in the<lb/>
yard among my flowers in summer<lb/>
&amp; write in <add><unclear>write in</unclear></add> my own words articles<lb/>
I read, so gathering the material I<lb/>
have &amp; compiling it on the Conquest<lb/>
has been a source of recreation for years.</p>
<p>I received several letters from Mr.<lb/>
Moran replying to questions <unclear>then thru</unclear><lb/>
our representative in Congress had a copy<lb/>
of &ldquo;Walter Reed Memorial&rdquo; and other<lb/>
sources so now I have brief and<lb/>
I am sure very accurate biographies of<lb/>
each man. I have tried to have every<lb/>
date <unclear>&amp;</unclear> statement correct but all as<lb/>
brief as can be. Just the very pertinent<lb/>
facts about each one <unclear>&amp;</unclear> you could read<lb/>
it all in 20 minutes I think.</p>
<p>I wouldn't have the money to have it<lb/>
published but <unclear>it</unclear> had paid me well<lb/>
in the interest I have had in providing<lb/>
it. I appreciate what you say about the<lb/>
picture of the little house. did before<lb/>
writing you in fact - but thought I could<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03908021"/>
only inquire <unclear>.</unclear></p>
<p>Should you care to exchange a picture of<lb/>
the little building I can give you in return<lb/>
photos of the members of the Commission <unclear>one of</unclear> Dr Carter <unclear>&amp;</unclear><lb/>
one of Dr. Gorgas all copies of pictures published in Mrs.<lb/>
Gorgas's book. I had them made by a photographer<lb/>
but <add>copies</add> <unclear>small</unclear> enough to have one for each article or<lb/>
biography I have written. Please let me know.</p>
<p>I did not know so many people were writing<lb/>
on the subject of Yellow Fever. I presume they feel<lb/>
as do I that it is the one great accomplishment<lb/>
next to the adoption of our constitution.</p>
<p><unclear>Thanking</unclear> you for any favor--</p>

<salute>I am- Very Truly</salute>
