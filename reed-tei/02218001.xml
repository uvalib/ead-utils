<dateline>
Sunday the 25th<lb/>
</dateline>
<salute>Dearest Mother:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter reached me this morning<lb/>
and I am so sorry to hear that you have<lb/>
been sick- I certainly hope you will be up<lb/>
and out again before this reaches you</p>
<p>The clipping you enclosed me was<lb/>
from the Sept. roster and what I referred to<lb/>
was in the Octo one- I am sure it was<lb/>
my length of service that caused me to drop<lb/>
for as you say my &ldquo;Ex.&rdquo; put me where I<lb/>
stood in the Sept. one- Thirty files means<lb/>
a good deal but it does not worry me<lb/>
much as it cant be helped. --</p>
<p>We are still enjoying the most<lb/>
delightful weather, and really our post life<lb/>
is mighty nice- The men organized a base<lb/>
ball League between the four companies at<lb/>
this post and have a game every Saturday<lb/>
and Sunday- we always turn out and<lb/>
enjoy watching what might be call good<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02218002"/>
ball- Todays game is between the best two Teams<lb/>
so were are expecting a first class game.</p>
<p>Humber and Miss <unclear>Gardina</unclear> are to be married<lb/>
on Dec. 14. her 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> birthday. They will<lb/>
leave the next day on a transport for the<lb/>
states and will return about the middle<lb/>
of Jany- Cooke leave on the same boat<lb/>
on a two months leave, he expects to<lb/>
spend the better part of it in New York<lb/>
and in Georgetown- I hope he will not<lb/>
miss you when he calls for I know<lb/>
you would enjoy seeing him- He<lb/>
is such a fine fellow-</p>
<p>Dr Walter and Miss Barling are to be married<lb/>
next April- That is if unforeseen things dont<lb/>
happen- Then of course it would come up<lb/>
sooner.</p>
<p>Dr Truby who has been at Columbia<lb/>
Barracks for some time has been ordered<lb/>
here as Post Surgeon, relieving Dr James who<lb/>
goes to <unclear>Cabana</unclear>. I for one must say that<lb/>
we are most delighted at the change for<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02218003"/>
James is very unpopular and quite common and<lb/>
not much more can be said of his wife.<lb/>
That leave us free from such among the<lb/>
married people and I must say they<lb/>
are as nice a set as one will ever find<lb/>
in any army post.</p>
<p>As for the unmarried ones out of 7 only<lb/>
<hi>one</hi> is a well off and he at times is not<lb/>
bad so all together we<del>re</del> are most fortunate<lb/>
We havent a single officer in the post who<lb/>
is a hard drinker - and only two drink at<lb/>
all so there is another good thing</p>
<p>I have practically broken off all corres-<lb/>
pondence with the Georgetown people - it was<lb/>
something which would have happened sooner or<lb/>
latter so they of their own accord by degrees<lb/>
cut it out.</p>
<p>Bessie most certainly proved to be<lb/>
the best and dearest friend I ever had and<lb/>
I must say I regret that she soon is to be<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02218004"/>
married. Belle has been faithful too but our<lb/>
letters are getting further and further apart-<lb/>
as for the rest they are dead</p>
<p>I hear from my friend Helen Young<lb/>
now and then she too will be married in<lb/>
the Spring-</p>
<p>Did you ever know Dr Kilbourne of<lb/>
the Med Corps? Two of his daughters are going<lb/>
to visit here this winter - they are to visit <hi>Mrs<lb/>
Humber</hi>. Mrs Clarke - my capt. wife - (he's about<lb/>
46 and she 27) is going to have a young girl<lb/>
from Ga- Mrs Hoyt expects one from Indianapolis<lb/>
and Mrs Walton expects one from New York. So things<lb/>
look like at least one may come if not<lb/>
more and will add to our already good times</p>
<p>Hoping that you are much better if not<lb/>
well with dearest love for your dear self and<lb/>
Blossom I am your devoted Son</p>
