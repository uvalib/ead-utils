<salute>My dear Col. Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>We arrived in Medellin this evening, and have come here on<lb/>
account of a report which President Nel Ospina gave me of yellow<lb/>
fever at Ebejico. I gained the impression from his remarks that<lb/>
there actually was an epidemic at that place now. The President<lb/>
did not ask me outright to come here but it seemed evident that he<lb/>
was quite interested, which I think is confirmed by the telegram<lb/>
which he sent to the &ldquo;Gobernedor&rdquo; of this place. The typewritten<lb/>
copy which Dr. Emiliano Henao M. showed me covered a full page of<lb/>
this size and if I can secure a copy of it I will send it to you.</p>
<p>On account of the fact that we will have a seven or eight<lb/>
hour ride by horse or mule back from here we have come &ldquo;light&rdquo; and I<lb/>
left my typewriter and other paraphernalia at Puerto Berrio. I de-<lb/>
cided to come at this time as we could do it with the least loss of<lb/>
time on our way down. We do not expect to be back up this way for<lb/>
some months, i.e., after we have established our work on the<lb/>
river and on the coast.</p>
<p>From the information which I am gathering it appears almost<lb/>
certain that there has been yellow fever in several points in the<lb/>
upper Magdelena district, such as at Ibagu&eacute;, Eb&eacute;jico and Cisneras<lb/>
on this R.R. Apparently it has about burned out at many of these<lb/>
points. Casceres on the Cauca River is said to have had about 20<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0302054"/>
-2-<lb/>
cases reported recently. This to my way of reasoning indicates<lb/>
the necessity of clearing up Cartagena, Barranquilla and the coast,<lb/>
because if it has not already reached there it soon will, as I stated<lb/>
in my letter from Rogota, relaying down via the river ports.</p>
<p>Both the Director of Public Health and the President are un-<lb/>
easy about this situation and have given me full authority to go<lb/>
ahead with the work wherever I think necessary.</p>
<p>On the way down we made an inspection at Girardat and found<lb/>
88% of the houses inspected showing stegamyia. I expect to put<lb/>
three men to work there (they claim 19000 population); they have a<lb/>
large transient population, and it can serve as a distributing point<lb/>
if infected.</p>
<p>As stated in my previous letter we go from here to Barranca-<lb/>
Bermeja and then to Bucaramanga and then to the coast. The minimum<lb/>
expense will be $10,000.00 per month for from 6 to 12 months, for the<lb/>
general campaign expense.</p>
<p>I am quite impatient about this delay in getting a general<lb/>
campaign under way, but there seems no way to avoid it.</p>
<p>I have written this on both sides to avoid weight for the areal<lb/>
mail. Will write or cable according to the urgency of the case.</p>

<salute>Very truly,</salute>
