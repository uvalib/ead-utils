P. S. To<unclear>'</unclear> letter of Dec. 6.<lb/>

<salute>My dear Col. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>This is the rather delayed P.S. to<lb/>
my letter of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I was glad to get<lb/>
the pictures of Se&ntilde;ora Raquel Romero<lb/>
She had <hi>Mrs</hi> on her visiting card<lb/>
when she was here. It is fine that<lb/>
you will be able to get home for<lb/>
Christmas. As regards my <hi>fatherly</hi><lb/>
advice to you I did not intend it to<lb/>
be in that way at all, but I felt that<lb/>
you were not very clear in your mind<lb/>
as to the legal limitations to the author-<lb/>
ity of a commanding officer. This is quite<lb/>
natural as many commanding officers<lb/>
do not themselves appreciate them.<lb/>
There is no military authority which<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06403113"/>
2<lb/>
can compel you to change a diagnosis<lb/>
and if a C.O. wants it or wants the<lb/>
<hi>line of duty</hi> changed from yes to no or<lb/>
vice versa, he cannot do it over your<lb/>
signature, but would have to initial the<lb/>
change himself, or have a reexamination<lb/>
by another officer. Gen. Leonard Wood,<lb/>
who was a great man and would have been<lb/>
President instead of the inept Harding,* was<lb/>
a Major. Gen training a division in the<lb/>
west for the World War, and told this<lb/>
story: He was driving along a country<lb/>
road when he saw one of his men, a<lb/>
private walking along the road with his<lb/>
girl. When they saw the General's Car<lb/>
with the two stars on the wind-shield<lb/>
they turned off the road, as the recruit<lb/>
did not want his girl see him have to<lb/>
*if he had been willing to let the <hi>elder statesmen</hi> of the<lb/>
Republican Party dictate who should be in his cabinet.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06403114"/>
3<lb/>
make a salute. So the General stopped<lb/>
his car and called the soldier to him<lb/>
and said to him in a low tone. You<lb/>
must not feel ashamed to salute an<lb/>
officer. It is not the man that you salute<lb/>
but the uniform and authority of the U.S.<lb/>
and the officer is as much obliged to<lb/>
return the salute as you are to make it.<lb/>
So the next time you see an officer coming<lb/>
when you are with your best girl, just<lb/>
say to her &ldquo;Now watch me make that old<lb/>
Duffer salute me&rdquo;_ then you stand up<lb/>
and salute me, and I will certainly<lb/>
return it, and your girl will see what a<lb/>
fine thing it is to wear a uniform&ldquo;-</p>
<p>As regards the Y F papers I will<lb/>
get a box and when I clean up my<lb/>
old files I will put into it everything<lb/>
relating to the Episode and will send it<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06403115"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
4<lb/>
to your home office. But this will<lb/>
be a matter of times and occasions<lb/>
and will not be there for you to<lb/>
go over at Christmas. You can use<lb/>
your ten days to better purpose than<lb/>
that. I have a fine letter from<lb/>
Gen Truby this morning. He tells<lb/>
me that he has sent you a copy of<lb/>
the letter I wrote to Dr. Ramos.<lb/>
That which I wrote you is a better<lb/>
presentation however as I had looked<lb/>
up &amp; quoted in my letter to you what<lb/>
Dr. Carlos E. Finlay said in his book<lb/>
I made that letter all on that subject<lb/>
so if you chose to send a copy of it<lb/>
to Dr. Albertini you could do so.<lb/>
Truly expressed himself as much pleas-<lb/>
ed with the letter to Dr Ramos and<lb/>
has sent you a copy of it. He thinks<lb/>
that it will be fine if you will han-<lb/>
dle this matter. I think Dr. A's proposition<lb/>
is absurd and when the proposition is put<lb/>
up to them to prove the exact moment when Guiteras was<lb/>
converted 44 years ago they will drop the matter I hope so</p>

<seg>
I inclose the notice of Dr Pintos death.<lb/>
I think that none of the first group<lb/>
who were bitten at the hospital at<lb/>
Columbia Bks took the matter seriously<lb/>
or believed in the mosquito theory.<lb/>
You will remember that none of them<lb/>
volunteered for the Camp Lazear exper-<lb/>
iments - tho. I think that Pinto had<lb/>
left Cuba by that time and had gone<lb/>
to the Philippines.<lb/>
