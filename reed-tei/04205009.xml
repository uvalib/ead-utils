<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of February 7th together with copy of<lb/>
letter to Dr. Carter and the paper giving your talk at the<lb/>
University of Virginia. I have not had time to read the<lb/>
paper as yet but will do so with pleasure.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter has written me that I might send you the<lb/>
mass of letters etc., which I will do as soon as I can get<lb/>
them out of storage, which means that as soon as the present<lb/>
blizzard is over I will be able to do so. We are having<lb/>
one snow storm after another and weather hovering around<lb/>
ten to fifteen degrees above zero and we are not used to it.</p>
<p>I referred to the contents of the trunk as a mass.<lb/>
Unfortunately, Laura Carter was one of those brilliant<lb/>
types who did not need to keep things in systematic order<lb/>
and the papers are just dumped into the trunks without any<lb/>
regard to order or system. My aunt who was with Laura<lb/>
and her father for quite a while, speaking of Laura's<lb/>
habits said that when she retired at night she would step<lb/>
out of her clothes and leave them right in the middle of<lb/>
the floor. Looking at the trunk and chest which I have<lb/>
gotten out of storage some time ago, I am reminded of what<lb/>
my aunt said.</p>
<p>I have looked through the contents of the chest which<lb/>
had a mass of stuff in no wise related to the medical work<lb/>
but did come across a lot which did and I find that there<lb/>
are articles many of them duplicates and frequently several<lb/>
copies and also copies of correspondence which Laura had<lb/>
evidently made. Where you run across this, there would<lb/>
certainly be no objection to your taking out and retaining<lb/>
a copy.</p>
<p>I hope to get them off to you in the near future.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
