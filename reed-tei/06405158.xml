<salute>My dear Colonel Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>From my delay in answering your<lb/>
fine letter of the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> July you would<lb/>
never guess the pleasure that it gave<lb/>
me. I was quite thrilled at the pleasure<lb/>
that it gave you to meet Houston Lazear<lb/>
and to explain to him that his father was<lb/>
a man of fine accomplishments and<lb/>
great courage and strength of character,<lb/>
who shared more than any one else in<lb/>
the credit of Walter Reed for clearing up<lb/>
the mysteries of intrinsic and extrinsic<lb/>
incubation of the yellow fever infection<lb/>
in the mosquito, which had defeated<lb/>
the experiments of Finlay's experi-<lb/>
ments on volunteers. Thus he had<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06405159"/>
2<lb/>
become a great and famous man whose<lb/>
merits were recognized by everyone who<lb/>
ever heard of them except by his own<lb/>
crazy wife. And I am so pleased that<lb/>
this pleasure should come to you whose<lb/>
interest in this great Episode began with<lb/>
your study of his father's career at the<lb/>
request of your common Alma mater.<lb/>
Also as I know, but you could not<lb/>
tell him, that you are the best qualified<lb/>
man in the whole world to tell him<lb/>
the story which had been held back<lb/>
from him by his mother. No wonder<lb/>
that Houston Lazear and his wife hung<lb/>
on your words and wanted to see as<lb/>
much of you and of Mrs Hench as<lb/>
they could. I am so pleased to hear<lb/>
also of your visits with the Trubys and<lb/>
that Mrs Hench should get to know<lb/>
Mrs Truby.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06405160"/>
3<lb/>
Is'nt Mrs. Truby a perfect dear.<lb/>
It is good too to have your good report<lb/>
of Gen. Truby's present condition. He<lb/>
has written to me recently of his physi-<lb/>
cal condition but I am glad to have<lb/>
a confirmation from your keen eyes.<lb/>
Your friend Dr. Crain has been very kind<lb/>
to us and to old Elizabeth. She went<lb/>
to see him on July 18 and was treated<lb/>
with great care and consideration. He<lb/>
examined her heart and her knees and<lb/>
prescribed for her and told her to come<lb/>
back at a certain date. But she went<lb/>
home and went to bed and has not<lb/>
been back to see him or to work for us<lb/>
since. She came to see us a week ago<lb/>
and stayed a couple of hours to talk over<lb/>
her affairs with Cornelia and me but<lb/>
she says she is too sick to work and<lb/>
I am afraid that she is, or thinks that<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06405161"/>
4<lb/>
she is which amounts to the same thing.<lb/>
She has a curious phobia which is that<lb/>
she cannot use an elevator without being<lb/>
affected with fainting or vertigo and so<lb/>
nothing will induce her to use an elevator.<lb/>
As Dr Crain's office is on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> floor of<lb/>
the building, she, with her weak heart and<lb/>
rheumatic knees and weak ankles and<lb/>
over weight, would not use the elevator but<lb/>
climbed the 7 flights of stairs! No wonder<lb/>
she went home and went to bed!<lb/>
I wrote to Dr. Crain to explain why she<lb/>
had not come for her second examination<lb/>
and got a second letter from him today<lb/>
I had hoped to talk her out of her phobia and<lb/>
Cornelia offered to go with her and go<lb/>
up in the elevator with her. But Dr. Crain<lb/>
says there is very little chance of doing any<lb/>
thing in such cases at her age. He offers<lb/>
if I will get the X rays of her knees taken<lb/>
to come by and see her here. Isnt that kind<lb/>

of him. He must be a very fine man<lb/>
from his letters. Old Elizabeth says that<lb/>
his secretary was very kind to her. That<lb/>
must have been the secretary who came<lb/>
from you. We have not had any help since<lb/>
Elizabeth got sick and Cornelia is quite<lb/>
played out with being maid of all<lb/>
work. The painters have complicated<lb/>
things be being here for ten days and<lb/>
have departed having the old house<lb/>
with its face lifted but every thing in<lb/>
in a mess, and the sashes and screens<lb/>
all stuck tight. I told the head painter<lb/>
that we were the most stuck-up people<lb/>
in Georgetown.</p>
<p>I know that when you returned to Rochester<lb/>
that you had a mountain of mail and<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06405163"/>
6<lb/>
many demands on your time and I am<lb/>
much flattered that you should push<lb/>
all these things aside to write that nice<lb/>
letter to me.</p>
<p>You have now two titles, both honorable,<lb/>
and I do not know which you would<lb/>
prefer to be addressed by. You see I have<lb/>
addressed you in this letter by your<lb/>
Army title and on the envelope by the<lb/>
title that they are accustomed to know you<lb/>
by in Rochester. Give me a hint when<lb/>
you write. Mrs Kean joins me in cordi-<lb/>
al regards to Mrs Hench</p>
