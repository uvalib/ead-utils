<p>COPY</p>
<p>REPORT ON LIVER TISSUE FROM SR. LUIS V. CORONA<lb/>
Received Sept. 18, 1923</p>
<p>The gross specimen is a block of liver tissue about 2 x 2 x 1/2 cm.<lb/>
It has a distinctly yellow appearance on the freshly cut surface. At one end<lb/>
the liver is honeycombed with round and oval cavities varying from a fraction<lb/>
of a millimeter to 2 mm. The material was received in formalin.</p>
<p><hi>Microscopic</hi>: Three slides were received stained with hematoxylin<lb/>
and eosin. A number of slides were prepared stained with Scarlet R, and<lb/>
other frozen sections were prepared stained with hematoxylin and eosin.<lb/>
Paraffin sections are in preparation.</p>
<p>The set of slides received and the hematoxylin and eosin slides pre-<lb/>
pared are practically identical. Liver lobulation is poorly preserved, but<lb/>
remains of liver cords can be distinguished. The liver cells are large and<lb/>
slightly separated from each other. Nuclei cannot be distinguished, but the<lb/>
entire cytoplasm takes a finely granular blue or purple stain. Approximately<lb/>
half the number of liver cells are vacuolated. The vast majority are large<lb/>
round vacuoles within the liver cells and occupy the larger part of the cyto-<lb/>
plasm. A few smaller vacuoles are present in the liver cells of other<lb/>
fields. These vacuolated cells have a slight tendency to occur in groups,<lb/>
but these groups appear to have no constant relation to periphery or centre<lb/>
of the lobule. These vacuoles, in the frozen sections stained with Scarlet<lb/>
R, are filled with large, red, round globules (fat) completely filling the<lb/>
vacuoles.</p>
<p>In addition to these intracellular vacuoles, there are large irregu-<lb/>
lar defects in the tissue, bearing no constant relation to any portion of<lb/>
the lobules, but occurring haphazard anywhere. They correspond to the holes<lb/>
seen in the gross. These spaces remain empty in the Scarlet R sections and<lb/>
resemble the gas spaces seen in gas bacillus infection.</p>

<p>Report on liver tissue from Sr. Luis V. Corona</p>
<p>In addition, there is a moderate increase of connective tissue<lb/>
in the portal spaces around the bile ducts and blood vessels, but not extend-<lb/>
ing around the lobules.</p>
<p>With the high dry power of the microscope the sections are found to<lb/>
be abundantly sprinkled over with large bacilli staining blue. These are<lb/>
found chiefly outside of the liver cells, but many are also present apparently<lb/>
within the cells.</p>
<p>On the above findings we conclude that the material is in an advanced<lb/>
stage of post mortem change. There is fat within many of the liver cells.<lb/>
The size and shape of the fat globules correspond to those seen in alcoholic<lb/>
fatty liver. The presence of the bacilli and gas vacuoles point to a gas<lb/>
bacillus infection. A moderate cirrhosis is also present. Definite con-<lb/>
clusions as to whether the liver came from a case of yellow fever are difficult<lb/>
to draw, but the type of fatty change seems to be against the possibility of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
