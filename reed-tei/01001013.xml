Dr. H. R. Carter,<lb/>
2121 California Street N. W.,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I see from your letter to Miss Harmon that she sent<lb/>
you the bulletins that I requested her to send. I must admit<lb/>
that your criticisms of &ldquo;Friend Anopheles&rdquo; are well taken. As<lb/>
to the why and wherefore explaining or offering any reason in<lb/>
extenuation of the crime of a supposedly sane antimalaria worker,<lb/>
allowing the passage and printing of a male A. Quad. with a very<lb/>
bulbous tipped proboscis, there is none. I saw this cartoon (in<lb/>
fact it was drawn at my request) before the bulletin was written<lb/>
(I wrote it myself) and ok'd it for the printer. I hope never<lb/>
to do such again.</p>
<p>However, the result is better than the effort. The<lb/>
bulletin is very popular. Our exhibit at the Norfolk fair has<lb/>
been visited by thousands of people and I know that two thousand<lb/>
have taken this bulletin away with them. Daily search of the fair<lb/>
grounds has amply demonstrated that although other bulletins on<lb/>
malaria and many on rural sanitation have been thrown promiscuously<lb/>
around the grounds, dropped on every section of the fair grounds,<lb/>
that in seven days of the fair but one of these bulletins was found.<lb/>
Even if the reason be that this bulletin is retained with the hope<lb/>
that the &ldquo;skeeter&rdquo; might be of interest to the baby at home or to<lb/>
keep it quiet while going home, at any rate the bulletin was retain-<lb/>
ed, which to me is an extremely encouraging sign.</p>
<p>Things in general are commencing to break rather well<lb/>
in Virginia. The town demonstrations (with the single exception<lb/>
of Ocean View) have gone extremely well in spite of the ferocious<lb/>
mosquito season now passing. In addition the Malaria Bureau (Dr.<lb/>
Kane and I) has succeeded in inducing Suffolk and Nansemond County<lb/>
to join hands with the State in organizing a combined City County<lb/>
Health Department. This will take care of future upkeep of Suf-<lb/>
folk's drainage work and will carry on active efforts looking to-<lb/>
wards county wide malaria control.</p>
<p>The success of this project and the propaganda plus<lb/>
the advertisement of the work from other towns (mainly Smithfield,<lb/>
Lawrenceville, and Oceana) leads us to believe that next season<lb/>
we will probably be successful in inducing at least two counties to<lb/>
employ a sanitary officer to do rural malaria control house-to-house<lb/>
education.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01001014"/>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>This education is going to largely consist of the estab-<lb/>
lishment and advertising of gambusia hatcheries, personal education<lb/>
in the proper use of quinine and screening. The heaviest and main<lb/>
stress will be placed upon screening as I believe it offers the best<lb/>
hope of good results.</p>
<p>Any criticisms or suggestions that you might make on<lb/>
this program would be appreciated.</p>
<p>As to the catechism, I agree most heartily with your<lb/>
objection to the removal of the illustrations. We have none of the<lb/>
catechisms left for distribution. We need at least 15,000 for use<lb/>
in the schools this session. The state appropriation limits the<lb/>
size of this bulletin so much that it is a case of either omit all<lb/>
illustrations or else so cut the lesson material as to make it of<lb/>
very little use for a teaching medium. In a subsequent season we<lb/>
shall make every effort to secure adequate appropriation to print<lb/>
a sufficient number of the unabridged catechism, but for this coming<lb/>
season we must cut our coat according to the cloth.</p>
<p>Gertrude joins me in affectionate regards to you and<lb/>
Laura.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>L. L. Williams, Jr.,<lb/>
P. A. Surgeon</signed>.
