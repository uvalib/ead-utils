<salute>Dearest Mumsie-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yours of the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi><lb/>
reached me yesterday,<lb/>
and I was very much<lb/>
relieved to have such<lb/>
good news of Caz. I am<lb/>
terribly disappointed a-<lb/>
bout Helen's coming, of<lb/>
course, for Rannie leaves<lb/>
about the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> for Santiago.<lb/>
But she must come<lb/>
as soon as she can. The<lb/>
Gorgases were in here<lb/>
last night, and they<lb/>
are going north very soon.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14344002"/>
Dr. Gorgas is to attend<lb/>
some medical meeting<lb/>
at the Pan-American and<lb/>
will be returning about<lb/>
the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, Mrs. Gorgas<lb/>
a little later. They both<lb/>
of them said they would<lb/>
be only too delighted to<lb/>
bring Helen down. Then<lb/>
Capt. Slocum, and prob-<lb/>
ably Mrs. Slocum will<lb/>
be coming this way about<lb/>
the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of October, and they<lb/>
would take the best of<lb/>
care of her. Carrie may<lb/>
be here at the same<lb/>
time, for she wrote<lb/>
Rannie asking if she<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14344003"/>
could come, but she has a scheme for<lb/>
making the trip via New Orleans, so<lb/>
I don't know when she will get here. I<lb/>
have insisted that Mama shall come<lb/>
back for the winter. For she improved<lb/>
so much last year I really think an-<lb/>
other mild winter will be of incalculable<lb/>
benefit to her. But she will not<lb/>
come until after Helen has made her<lb/>
visit; which must not be a short one.<lb/>
Rannie and I insist upon that.</p>
<p>As to the yellow fever experiments Dr.<lb/>
Caldas (the Brazilian) has failed en-<lb/>
tirely. The man he had &ldquo;immunized&rdquo;<lb/>
came down in three days after being<lb/>
bitten by a mosquitoe. So it will not<lb/>
be necessary to fool with him any more.<lb/>
I was not surprised, as his methods<lb/>
were those of a quack and not a<lb/>
scientist. I believe the Journal has<lb/>
mixed up Dr. Gorgas and Dr. <unclear>Caldas,</unclear><lb/>
and has been raising a row generally,<lb/>
but I don't suppose anybody pays much<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14344004"/>
attention to the sayings<lb/>
of The Journal. Dr.<lb/>
Carroll will now have<lb/>
a case or two of experi-<lb/>
mental fever for his<lb/>
purposes, and I think<lb/>
that will be all for Dr.<lb/>
Caldas is a fake, and no-<lb/>
body here doubts the mos-<lb/>
quitoe theory any more.<lb/>
Aug. 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.</p>
<p>It was so dreadfully<lb/>
hot and muggy I could<lb/>
not finish this yesterday<lb/>
afternoon. We hear there<lb/>
is a cyclone south of<lb/>
us, so we are probably<lb/>
feeling the effects of it.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14344005"/>
This afternoon it is<lb/>
raining slowly, but<lb/>
steadily, which is very<lb/>
unusual for this country.<lb/>
But fine for the flowers.<lb/>
They are doing splendid-<lb/>
ly. I shall be very glad<lb/>
to have some <unclear>nastur-<lb/>
tiuns</unclear> seeds, but I won't<lb/>
plant them for another<lb/>
month, because the worms<lb/>
eat them up here in<lb/>
summer, just as they<lb/>
used to in Key West.<lb/>
Geraniums only do<lb/>
pretty well, and we<lb/>
have some, so don't<lb/>
bother to send any<lb/>
of those, but I would<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14344006"/>
like some parsley seed, if you can<lb/>
get it.</p>
<p>Bobs has cut one great big tooth, and<lb/>
another is coming through, I think,<lb/>
for he has been a little upset for<lb/>
two or three days.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear Peg is going to<lb/>
Coburg. I hope the change will do her<lb/>
a great deal of good. Dr. Field wrote<lb/>
Capt. Slocum that Doll was the exact<lb/>
counterpart of me!</p>
<p>A letter came from Carrie today, and<lb/>
she is still undecided which way to<lb/>
come, so perhaps if Helen wrote to her<lb/>
they could arrange to come down together<lb/>
which would be very nice for them both.<lb/>
Her address is P. O. Box 22 Wytheville Va.<lb/>
Evie will spend the winter at Edgehill<lb/>
I think. The new lieutenants are coming<lb/>
by every boat, so the girls ought to<lb/>
have a pretty good time. Rannie<lb/>
is very well, but terribly busy with esti-<lb/>
mates. He goes to Matanzas next week for<lb/>
a few days. Love to all</p>
