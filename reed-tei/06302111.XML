Chief of the War Department's Map Collection<lb/>
Army War College<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, General Ireland brought me to your War College, in<lb/>
an effort to get copies of old army maps of Camp Columbia, Quemados (Havana), Cuba.<lb/>
For three years I have been doing some historical researches on the work of Walter<lb/>
Reed and other army surgeons in the conquest of yellow fever. I have made two trips<lb/>
to Cuba and have been trying to find these old maps. I am especially anxious to<lb/>
get a copy of the map of Camp Columbia for 1898 and for 1899. The sergeant in<lb/>
charge of these maps showed General Ireland and me two different maps for 1899 and<lb/>
suggested that I write to you formally requesting copies of these maps. In the<lb/>
official reports of the Secretary of War for the corresponding years, I found mention<lb/>
of these maps and also mention of a property map of Camp Columbia. You may be inter-<lb/>
ested to know that this map is not in your files but is in the files of the Archives<lb/>
Building, should you wish a copy of it for your own files. The Secretary of War<lb/>
of Cuba very kindly put their maps at my disposal, but they only had fragments, quite<lb/>
torn from long use, of two or three maps which I have not been able to locate elsewhere.<lb/>
They are very anxious to exchange copies of these maps with you. They, too, would<lb/>
like to have copies of the 1898 and 1899 maps.</p>
<p>I am enclosing photographs which I had taken of the parts of these maps and<lb/>
I am so hopeful that you will have these original maps that I may have copies of them<lb/>
as well as the ones I now have. Any help you can give me in this matter will be<lb/>
greatly appreciated, and I am sure that General Ireland would give you further in-<lb/>
formation as to the reason for my request.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, on my first visit to Cuba, I found that the<lb/>
Cuban government had lost sight of Camp Lazear where Walter Reed did his work. They<lb/>
had bought a piece of property and were about to erect a memorial on the wrong site.<lb/>
Through a lucky chain of circumstances I was able to find the lost Camp Lazear, and<lb/>
actually found remaining, in pretty good condition, one of the little buildings used<lb/>
by Walter Reed in his experiments. I have bought this building and with friends I<lb/>
am trying to raise money to restore it and properly memorialize it and also Camp<lb/>
Lazear. It is in connection with these researches that I am so anxious to have<lb/>
these maps of Camp Columbia.</p>
