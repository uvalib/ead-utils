<pb n="1" id="f01306005"/>
<p>1: There was a great increase of malaria after the Civil War in my<lb/>
section of Virginia--just above tide-water. This country had never been<lb/>
free from malaria, but, on our plantation at least, it had not been of<lb/>
sanitary importance for a number of years. After the war several of the<lb/>
family had it: myself and two little sisters, and it was fairly general,<lb/>
though not severe, all over our neighborhood.</p>
<p><unclear>Sheridan</unclear></p>
<p>(a) Living conditions were hard. From the time Sherman went through,<lb/>
in April <unclear>1665</unclear>, we had no meat of any kind--save a few birds and two rabbits<lb/>
that we boys killed with stones (fire-arms had been taken away)--until<lb/>
November 18th, when we killed a wild hog (a decendent of tame ones) in a<lb/>
trap. We had a little flour and our family lived practically on partially<lb/>
spoilt corn (the &ldquo;nubbin pile&rdquo;--all the rest had been taken): potatoes and<lb/>
wild salad plants--especially water cross. In land our people were rich--<lb/>
there were some 1600 acres in this plantation--and I judge our neighbors fed<lb/>
no better than we.</p>
<p>(b) Ditches were filled up and cleared land overgrown.</p>
<p>(c) Live stock had practically been removed. Save mules and horses,<lb/>
however, they had never been housed and the latter not much in the summer time.</p>
<p>(d) Quinine was scarce: high priced and difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>Malaria gradually disappeared here as the country resumed its former<lb/>
status, retreating toward the east.</p>
<p>2: Up to about <unclear>1870</unclear> our country was mainly engaged in the raising of<lb/>
wheat as a money crop, considerable corn, however, being also raised for the<lb/>
horses and <unclear>mules</unclear> used to plow for the wheat. With the opening up of the<lb/>
North-West (Minnesota and Dakota) as wheat states and the drop in transportation<lb/>
rates on the land grant roads from this section and from Iowa about this time,<lb/>
wheat was no longer profitable in Virginia and was, to an extent, substituted<lb/>
<unclear>by</unclear> tobacco and by cattle.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01306006"/>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Naturally this le<del>a</del>d (a) to economic depression: (b) to neglect of<lb/>
drainage and growing up of cultivated land--especially low land. Wheat<lb/>
was raised on fairly high--always well drained--land: corn, indeed, on<lb/>
low ground, but, little corn being now needed, much of this was also turned<lb/>
out. (c) Cattle were increased, but were not housed in summer. Quinine<lb/>
if anything cheaper. (d) A decided diminution in population.</p>
<p>Malaria increased considerably. Not to the same extent as directly<lb/>
after the war, but it has continued more or less ever since as <del>we</del> have in-<lb/>
deed the other conditions.</p>
<p>Take your choice as to the weight of the different factors. We thought--<lb/>
and I still think--the abandonment of the land, and especially of the bottom<lb/>
land, leading to poor drainage, was the most efficient. Tobacco, you know,<lb/>
is cultivated only on well drained land and usually in small patches as one<lb/>
cannot attend to a large area.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f01306007"/>
<p>In the country just north of Cairo, Illinois, in 1879 malaria<lb/>
was <hi>excessively</hi> prevalent. Few were living in that country save<lb/>
negroes. They only were farming it. The food in this country--<lb/>
I have eaten at their houses--was coarse and with little variety,<lb/>
but rather more than abundant. The houses of the whites were good to<lb/>
fairly good. Few screens. I visited it again in the fall of <unclear>1887</unclear>.<lb/>
Malaria still prevailed here, but not more than 25% of what I had seen<lb/>
before. The negroes, who had cleared and partly ditched the land, had<lb/>
been replaced by white farmers. In 1910 I visited Cairo a third time,<lb/>
and was told, although I did not go up into the &ldquo;Bottoms&rdquo; that while<lb/>
there was malaria there, there was no great deal. Very few negroes and<lb/>
the land was mainly drained. It was not a stock country, corn and hay<lb/>
being the crops--the first mainly.</p>
