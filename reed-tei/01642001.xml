<salute>My Sweet &ldquo;little B.&rdquo;;</salute>
</opener>
<p>If you have<lb/>
received my last letter, you will<lb/>
remember that I said that I<lb/>
should, on Monday, expect a<lb/>
sweet letter from you. Well,<lb/>
sure enough the epistle came,<lb/>
clad in the most lofty iro-<lb/>
ny(?) and worthy of the<lb/>
celebrated &ldquo;John of Roa-<lb/>
noke.&rdquo; I almost expected to<lb/>
see his signature attached<lb/>
in full to the document-<lb/>
You' dear little creature, you<lb/>
<hi>will have your way</hi>; won't<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01642002"/>
you? That's right, my precious,<lb/>
insist upon this always &amp; I<lb/>
will ever be happy to support<lb/>
your efforts- I <hi>admire in-<lb/>
dependence</hi>, possessing a<lb/>
slight share of the same<lb/>
myself. What's the use of ex-<lb/>
isting, at all, if we can't<lb/>
make our prescence felt-?<lb/>
Power! 'Tis sweet to wield it!<lb/>
A &ldquo;fig&rdquo; for timidity!- Forsooth,<lb/>
what right had my mind, even<lb/>
in sleep, to be entertaining<lb/>
itself with visions of &ldquo;fas-<lb/>
cinating widows&rdquo;? Did I for-<lb/>
get that there is <hi>one</hi> (bless<lb/>
her darling heart!) to whom<lb/>
I am strictly accountable,<lb/>
asleep or awake? Forgive<lb/>
me, &ldquo;my little B.&rdquo;, this one time,<lb/>
and I'll avoid all such<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01642003"/>
in the Future. And then, how<lb/>
you did dive into metaphys-<lb/>
ics! My! I had no idea that<lb/>
you would detect the weak<lb/>
points of my narrative &amp;<lb/>
play such sad havoc with<lb/>
it. If it is really true, my<lb/>
dear E., as you say, (and since<lb/>
you say so, you'll excuse<lb/>
me if I adopt your line of<lb/>
argument,) that the mind, du-<lb/>
ring sleep, is still busy<lb/>
with the very thoughts that<lb/>
absorbed its attention, du-<lb/>
ring <add>waking</add> moments; if this be true,<lb/>
I think it will unavoida-<lb/>
bly follow that e're another<lb/>
sun rises (if not already)<lb/>
you'll imagine your name<lb/>
changed to Lewter! How<lb/>
delightful that would be!<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01642004"/>
Long life to Lewter &amp; Lawrence!<lb/>
By the way, I had another dream,<lb/>
&amp; this time, it was very pleasant,<lb/>
but since my dreams seem<lb/>
to serve as a target for your<lb/>
choicest irony, I'll keep it<lb/>
to myself, till I next see you.<lb/>
Remember this -- I am deter-<lb/>
mined to dream no more, till<lb/>
after the <hi>fall of '76</hi>! After<lb/>
that, I anticipate that my whole<lb/>
life will be like a sweet<lb/>
dream- With such a guardian<lb/>
angel as you, my darling, by<lb/>
my side, my life will, indeed,<lb/>
be one continual state of dream-<lb/>
y happiness -- no disagreeable<lb/>
fancies flitting across my<lb/>
mind- no! no! for an angel of<lb/>
peace &amp; joy will be with me!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01642005"/>
I care not how fast the time<lb/>
flies, for I know that, each mo<del>m</del>-<lb/>
ment spent, but brings me <hi>nearer<lb/>
the dear creature</hi> whom I love<lb/>
with all my heart! why talk,<lb/>
my darling, about the &ldquo;non-conge-<lb/>
niality&rdquo; of our dispositions? As<lb/>
if, forsooth, such a thing could<lb/>
be! Loving you as I do, I<lb/>
have no fear whatever that<lb/>
such will be; and when you<lb/>
have learned to truly love, I<lb/>
feel sure that all foreboding<add>s</add><lb/>
will disappear. Hidden in my<lb/>
heart of hearts, you will be<lb/>
a sweet fountain giving light<lb/>
&amp; life to all things, and I shall<lb/>
rest contented in your love.</p>
<p>Aug. 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, 9 P.M.<lb/>
I was inter<add>r</add>upted in the writing<lb/>
of my letter, by being compelled<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01642006"/>
to visit New York City, so that<lb/>
my letter will not be mailed till<lb/>
to-morrow morning, &amp; will not reach<lb/>
you till next Monday- I had a<lb/>
very dreary day for my jour-<lb/>
ney, inasmuch as it was rai-<lb/>
ning almost continuously du-<lb/>
ring the day, &amp; <add>as</add> I was not pro-<lb/>
vided with an umbrella, I got<lb/>
a little moistened. When I re-<lb/>
turned, this evening, I would have<lb/>
gone on, at once, with my<lb/>
writing, but Dr Byrne insisted<lb/>
so strenuously that I should<lb/>
make a call with him, that<lb/>
I couldn't politely refuse.<lb/>
We called at Lieutenant Mer-<lb/>
cur's -- He doesn't happen to<lb/>
be a bachelor like myself --<lb/>
I met his wife, a pleasant<lb/>
lady, &amp; also his sister who<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01642007"/>
looks to be about 22, but by<lb/>
no means pretty- You perceive<lb/>
that although I am an &ldquo;engag-<lb/>
ed&rdquo; gentleman, I still can tell<lb/>
whether a lady is good-looking<lb/>
or not. (I haven't seen anyone<lb/>
with <hi>such</hi> a <hi>face</hi> as <hi>yours</hi>,<lb/>
nor do I anticipate any such<lb/>
rapturous visions, till I re-<lb/>
turn, next fall.)</p>
<p>True to my word, I have be-<lb/>
gun the study of French, and<lb/>
oh! how I wish you were<lb/>
present to teach me the<lb/>
proper pronunciation -- It is<lb/>
terribly difficult -- I'm afraid<lb/>
you would have to scold<lb/>
me mercilessly- I am de-<lb/>
termined, however, to learn<lb/>
the language &amp; have, to-day,<lb/>
finished my 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> lesson.<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01642008"/>
I shall begin German in a<lb/>
few days, &amp; thus study the two<lb/>
languages conjointly- With these<lb/>
&amp; general literature, I can<lb/>
manage to spend my time quite<lb/>
profitably- I want to study 10<lb/>
hours a day, besides taking<lb/>
a plenty of exercise, so as<lb/>
not to endanger my health.<lb/>
I am so much behind the<lb/>
times, &amp; make so poor an ap-<lb/>
pearance compared with the<lb/>
majority of young gentleman<lb/>
one meets in society, that<lb/>
I feel as if I should not<lb/>
spare a moment from my books.<lb/>
But, for your sake, my precious E.,<lb/>
I will take good care of my health.<lb/>
As the page is about filled, I will say<lb/>
&ldquo;goodnight-&rdquo;</p>
<closer>
<salute>Ever, your fond,<lb/>
and devoted</salute>
