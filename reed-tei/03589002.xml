Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>
Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In reference to your letter of August 14, 1940, I have<lb/>
the honor of answering your first question in which<lb/>
you mention the fact that you have been asked to make a<lb/>
report for the Cuban Government explaining why you be-<lb/>
lieve they have erroneously located the site of Camp<lb/>
Lazear by the railroad track behind Military City.</p>
<p>I have no doubt whatsoever <unclear>regarding</unclear> the veracity of<lb/>
this point, for I believe that site to be the exact one hav-<lb/>
ing nothing to do in any way with the Camp established by<lb/>
Dr. Reed in the San Jose Farm, belonging to Dr. Rojas. This<lb/>
Camp, very distant from the Military Hospital of Columbia,<lb/>
was the first established by Dr. Reed before starting to<lb/>
prove the experiences of Finlay in order to follow the<lb/>
theories of contagion and the investigations regarding the<lb/>
&ldquo;Basilo de Sanarelly&rdquo;. These investigations failed and<lb/>
by order of General Wood and Dr. Gorgas, a conference with<lb/>
Dr. Finlay was decided upon in which, not only did Dr. Finlay<lb/>
disclose his experiences, give in his works, but proved his<lb/>
honorability and manliness by turning in the larvae of the<lb/>
<unclear>Hestegomia</unclear>.</p>
<p>Wrong!<lb/>
PS Hench</p>
<p>no!</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Then for these experiences was established the Yellow Fe-<lb/>
ver Camp, in the place considered by the Cuban Government,<lb/>
that is behind Military City, then Camp Columbia, past<lb/>
the Marianao Railroad Track in the &ldquo;Alturas Farm&rdquo; of Father<lb/>
Zamora. After the death of the <hi>unfortunate Dr. Lazear</hi>, the<lb/>
25th of September, <hi>at which funeral I was present, the</hi><lb/>
American Government named this Camp, and no other, &ldquo;Camp<lb/>
Lazear&rdquo;. Dr. Jefferson R. Kean, major Doctor of the 7th<lb/>
Cavalry, <unclear>who</unclear> was our chief, was also present at the fu-<lb/>
neral but not so Dr. Reed who had been staying now for<lb/>
quite a time in Washington. He did not return to Cuba un-<lb/>
til after Dr. Lazear and Dr. Agramonte had proven the first<lb/>
case in the person of the soldier, William D. Dean, from<lb/>
the 7th Cavalry, news that were cablegrammed by the above<lb/>
mentioned Doctors to Reed in Washington.</p>
<p>no.</p>

GEN. LEE No. 19. MARIANAO</p>
<p>Dr. Philip S. Hench</p>
<p>9-3-40</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>You mention the fact that because of the incident in<lb/>
1900 of having a case of Yellow Fever in Real No. 102<lb/>
and then another case back of this house, General Lee<lb/>
No. 20, and still another in front of the latter, Dr.<lb/>
Reed thought that perhaps a flying insect might be the<lb/>
transmitter of the Yellow Fever. <hi>I have been able to<lb/>
prove that in Real No. 102, that still under the same<lb/>
number</hi> is the property of Dr. Suarez Solis, existed a<lb/>
Military office of the American Army but I have been un-<lb/>
able to prove the case of Yellow Fever to which you make<lb/>
reference.</p>
<p><hi>In General Lee #20 the proprietor was, and still is,</hi><lb/>
Major Luis Rodolfo Miranda, at present Sub-Secretary<lb/>
of State of this Republic. The tenant of this house<lb/>
does not remember in the last <hi>nine years</hi> any case of<lb/>
Yellow Fever. I do remember, however, a case in that<lb/>
house of a high chief of the American Army reported to<lb/>
have Yellow Fever by a local Doctor. By order of Major<lb/>
Kean, Dr. Lazear and myself, after close examination,<lb/>
came to the conclusion that it was a case of Bronco-<lb/>
Pneumonia.</p>
<p>In General Lee #16 a case was reported by Dr. Silverio,<lb/>
a Mrs. Muller; the committee gathered and Dr. Lazear, Dr.<lb/>
Silverio and myself proved the case to be Yellow Fever.</p>
<p>In the house across the street from this residence Dr.<lb/>
Kean and his wife suffered a case of Yellow Fever and<lb/>
were sent to the Yellow Fever Hospital.</p>
<p>I cannot understand how a Dr. as eminent and of such<lb/>
prestige as Dr. Reed would think that Yellow Fever was<lb/>
transmitted by a winged agent when in the year 1881,<lb/>
Dr. Carlos J. Finlay had disclosed his theory proven in a<lb/>
Congress at Washington, and when <hi>Mason's</hi> experiences<lb/>
concerning Filaria O. were already known.</p>
<p><hi><unclear>Manson</unclear></hi></p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Considerations:-- If Dr. Walter Reed lived he wouldn't<lb/>
have allowed, because of his honor, to have the glory<lb/>
of Dr. Finlay be put under consideration for even a moment--<lb/>
a glory recognized by the whole world.</p>

<p>I hope this letter pleases you for such has been my<lb/>
wish.</p>
<p>If you desire any data in the work you have titled<lb/>
&ldquo;Carlos J. Finlay&rdquo;, in his &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; by Dr. Fran-<lb/>
