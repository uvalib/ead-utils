<salute>My Dear Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It seems a long time since I wrote<lb/>
to you &amp; yet I think. I wrote a postal last<lb/>
Saturday or Sunday. Which was it?</p>
<p>This is the &ldquo;Jumping Off Place&rdquo;! It<lb/>
is a mining town-or rather Camp-<lb/>
About the head of navigation of the<lb/>
left (eastern) fork of the Black War-<lb/>
rior.- We reached it Sunday a-<lb/>
bout 1 A.M. in a launch- We<lb/>
walked - 1 1/2 miles, &amp; found a boar-<lb/>
ding house - the only one we could<lb/>
hear of. We, that <del>it</del><add>is</add> LePrince &amp; Dr Grif-<lb/>
fitts, pushed a hand - car - from the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00764058"/>
2<lb/>
Camp to the boat (1 1/2 miles) got<lb/>
the trunks &amp; came up 1/2 mile &amp;<lb/>
met a Wagon, which brought them<lb/>
here, We slept - <hi>5</hi> in a room - the<lb/>
first night. 2 R. R. men &amp; we three<lb/>
but since then have a room to<lb/>
us 3. <del><unclear></unclear></del> The regular charge is<lb/>
75 cents per day for board- (or<lb/>
$5.00 per week) but we agree to pay <del>10 cents</del><lb/>
10 cents extra because <del>it</del> our coming<lb/>
will require the hiring of <add>an</add> extra help<lb/>
30 cents per day.</p>
<p>The place is clean &amp; the buscuit are<lb/>
<del>do</del> cooked done, &amp; the water is good<lb/>
so it is all right for a temporary<lb/>
stay, I really don't care how tempora-<lb/>
ry<lb/>
<unclear>is</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00764059"/>
3<lb/>
temporary however. I really get<lb/>
all I want to eat &amp; it is good enough<lb/>
- we have had chicken once. It is<lb/>
<hi>cool</hi>, quite cool at night. That &amp; good<lb/>
water make up for many minor<lb/>
discomforts- Also I have felt no<lb/>
red-bugs since last Saturday -<lb/>
this is Wednesday. We have seen<lb/>
no ice since Saturday a week ago<lb/>
at Tuscaloosa.</p>
<p><del>W</del> There have been terrific rains in<lb/>
this section - about 5 may<add>be</add> 6 inches<lb/>
of water fell- July 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>, 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> &amp; 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>; <del>which</del><lb/>
<del>has a</del> &amp; the river is about 6 feet<lb/>
above normal. <add>This has interfered</add> with our work very<lb/>
much, lost us all of two days I<lb/>
think. Indeed I did not take the<lb/>
party<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00764060"/>
4<lb/>
out today as it would have been<lb/>
useless. What we did yester-<lb/>
day <add>&amp; Monday</add> was of little value. Still it<lb/>
gives us a chance to examine a<lb/>
swollen river &amp; every new<lb/>
view point contains some in-<lb/>
formation. At any rate resting<lb/>
today gives me a chance to write<lb/>
this letter. LePrince &amp; Griffitts<lb/>
have walked across the country<lb/>
- about 4 miles - to see if we can<lb/>
make arrangements to board<lb/>
2 or 3 days with some farmers<lb/>
so that we can be close to our base<lb/>
in <del>in</del> examining a certain creek<lb/>
(Prescott's) which we want to look<lb/>
into<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00764061"/>
5<lb/>
into. We are not going to<lb/>
leave this place however un-<lb/>
til we get our mail, I especi-<lb/>
ally want to get <hi>June's</hi> check<lb/>
&amp; start it back to Baltimore.</p>
<p>I have become hard &amp; tough. Am<lb/>
careful about going up hills &amp;<lb/>
do not begin to do the work I<lb/>
did last year, yet I do as<lb/>
much or more than the aver-<lb/>
age man of my age can do,<lb/>
&amp; am not hurt by it. Eat<lb/>
enough, I am <hi>very</hi> careful a-<lb/>
bout eating, &amp; think that I will<lb/>
get rid of all superfluous fat<lb/>
on this trip. Walk a plenty,<lb/>
paddle a canoe, an hour or so<lb/>
- say 3 to 4 hours<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00764062"/>
6<lb/>
per day - &amp; am <hi>not</hi> unduly tired<lb/>
when night comes.</p>
<p>But for the rain we would<lb/>
have gone to <unclear>Cordova-,</unclear> head<lb/>
of Navigation of the West fork -<lb/>
on Saturday, but as it has<lb/>
happened I cannot tell what<lb/>
we will do. We may not go<lb/>
there at all as I am anx-<lb/>
ious to get into South Carolina<lb/>
- Parr Shoals, <hi>When</hi> we must do<lb/>
so I may learn by the next mail<lb/>
- tomorrow night I think - from Dr<lb/>
Hayne,- A week between mails is<lb/>
a reminder of Chandeleur. Cordova<lb/>
is a town - 1500 to 2000 people I hear &amp;<lb/>
I judge more civilized than<lb/>
this<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f00764063"/>
7<lb/>
this. However this is more a-<lb/>
musing than annoying - as long<lb/>
as the weather is reasonably <del><unclear>coal</unclear></del><lb/>
cool &amp; one keeps well. It can't<lb/>
stay cool much longer however<lb/>
&amp; so I hope we will soon get away.</p>
<p>We are going to await our mail<lb/>
here - for - even on Prescott's<lb/>
creek - <del>on</del> we will get our<lb/>
mail here, because we<lb/>
are getting short of money.<lb/>
I have been financing<lb/>
<hi>the</hi> whole party to some extent.<lb/>
I have <del>2</del> $ 23.00/100 left &amp; am keeping<lb/>
enough to get to Birmingham<lb/>
<del>the</del> at all hazards. If <del>the</del> necessary<lb/>
then I will<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f00764064"/>
8<lb/>
go <unclear>over</unclear> it is 36 miles only - &amp;<lb/>
borrow from Noland or - rather<lb/>
get him to cash a check, <del>not</del><lb/>
not to be put in for collec-<lb/>
tion until - say - <hi>July 20</hi>,<lb/>
so as to get my <add>U.S.</add> check in<lb/>
first.</p>
<p>I am due $140, from the Yadkin<lb/>
valley <add>Power</add> Company, which ought to be<lb/>
in the mail by Saturday &amp; $45,<lb/>
<add>may's accounts</add> from the Bureau, LePrince<lb/>
is due about $110 from the first<lb/>
&amp; $90 from the Bureau, I have<lb/>
an account of $116 00/100 for June - which<lb/>
I can't send in until I get a receipt<lb/>
for $33 00/100. I sent (check for) to the Ala Pow-<lb/>
er Company,<lb/>
<del>this</del> so you see I will have money enough<lb/>
when I get it. This is a long letter<lb/>
my dear &amp; I <unclear>hope</unclear> you will enjoy<lb/>
getting it</p>
