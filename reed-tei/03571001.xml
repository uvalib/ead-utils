FROM GUST LAMBERT<lb/>
<salute>Dear Friend Lambert:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You have been in my mind much of the time lately. I've<lb/>
wondered how you are managing and whether you would be able <unclear>to</unclear><lb/>
to retain your job.</p>
<p>I realize, of course, that you have suffered a terrible loss<lb/>
and one that will affect your future - to say nothing of<lb/>
what it will do to your feelings. I know that this is<lb/>
not the first hard jolt that has been handed you and that<lb/>
you are too good a soldier to allow this to get you.</p>
<p>Then, too, I have wondered whether you have heard anything<lb/>
about your bill in congress. If the time they have taken<lb/>
on the selective service legislation is any criterion, is is<lb/>
not likely that your bill will get action for a long time.</p>
<p>We have had a little excitement in the neighborhood since you<lb/>
were here. The factory buildings of the Hollingshead Co.,<lb/>
in the square above us, together with 67 residences - some in<lb/>
the same block and some across the street - were burned on the<lb/>
afternoon of July 30. It was the largest fire Camden has<lb/>
ever had. Ten lives were lost and the damage will amount<lb/>
to a million and a half. If there had not been a strong<lb/>
wind blowing the fire away from us we would probably have been<lb/>
burned out.</p>
<p>Saw a squib in the paper a few days ago to the effect that<lb/>
&ldquo;Capt. Thomas M. England, one of the heroes who risked their<lb/>
lives 30 years ago in Cuba experimenting with yellow fever con-<lb/>
trol will retire from active service Oct. 31, upon reaching<lb/>
the statutory age limit of 64 years.&rdquo; The lad has had it<lb/>
pretty soft all these years, hasn't he?</p>
<p>Had a very brief note from Schwieger, yesterday, saying that<lb/>
he is in the country and will write me when he returns.</p>
<p>The state conventions of the Veterans of Foriegn Wars and the<lb/>
American Lagion were both held in Camden, this year. The<lb/>
parades of both passed our house and I had a good chance to<lb/>
look 'em over. Things like that help to break the monotony.</p>
<p>Mrs. Andrus joins me in sending kindest regards and every good<lb/>
wish. I know it is not easy for you to write but I will<lb/>
appreciate hearing how you are getting along, if it is only a<lb/>
few lines.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
