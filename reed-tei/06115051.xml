<title>Letter from Laura Wood to Philip Showalter Hench, November 19, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Wood describes the notebook she examined at the New York Academy of Medicine, which is alleged to be Reed's. She thinks it is not Reed's notebook, but does find it interesting that the writer caught mosquitoes near a yellow fever outbreak in Havana and dissected them in the lab. She wonders if it is Lazear's.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was just about to write to you when your letter came.<lb/>
It was only last week that I returned to Washington, after<lb/>
a much longer stay on the Cape than I had planned. I'd<lb/>
like to have the Senate Document now, if you can spare it<lb/>
all right.</p>
<p>Have you seen the notebook at the New York Academy of Medi-<lb/>
cine Library? Dr. Malloch told me that it was sold to them<lb/>
with the allegation that it was Reed's own ms notebook, but<lb/>
that Dr. Russell - I think that's the name, anyway, he's at<lb/>
Harvard - said he was positive it was Neate's handwriting.<lb/>
It is certainly not Reed's notebook, because some of the<lb/>
entries were made when he wasn't even there - Cuba - but<lb/>
what I found interesting about it was that the writer, on<lb/>
May 23, 1900, recorded that he went to 20 General Lee St.,<lb/>
where yellow fever had broken out, and caught a bunch of mos-<lb/>
quitoes, which he took back to the laboratory and dissected.<lb/>
The notebook is unsigned, but the writer, to judge from the<lb/>
context, is certainly a doctor; and no dr but Lazear was in-<lb/>
terested in the relation of yellow fever to mosquitoes at<lb/>
that time. So I think they probably have Lazear's own ms<lb/>
notebook of cases he attended. It also has some pages of<lb/>
experiments and observations on electrozone. Unfortunately,<lb/>
I had only a few minutes to see the notebook, and although I<lb/>
expected to go back the next day and read more of it I was<lb/>
not able to. However, I had the 4 pages about catching the<lb/>
mosquitoes and the record of the 1st case at 20 General Lee<lb/>
St. photostated. This little discovery - if that's what it<lb/>
is - is most interesting, but not useful, to me, but I thought<lb/>
it might be of some value to you. If you're unacquainted with<lb/>
the notebook I'll be glad to send you the photostats for a look,<lb/>
and then send them to you to keep later, when I'm all through.<lb/>
I want to show them to General Kean to see if he can identify<lb/>
the writing, but have been so busy trying to get a few chapters<lb/>
ready for the publisher - I've completely missed the deadline -<lb/>
that I haven't taken the time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed knows that I want to see her, and so does the General;<lb/>
since that is the case, I don't much feel like asking to again,<lb/>
especially since I talked to him a couple of days ago and he<lb/>
didn't say anything about her having recovered.</p>
