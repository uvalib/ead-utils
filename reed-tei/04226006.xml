<salute>My dear Doctor Bettmann:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am sorry that I neglected to send you the four prints on yellow<lb/>
fever. I sent you a check some time ago. I have returned these by separate post.</p>
<p>May I make the following suggestion. One day in New York this spring<lb/>
and a half day in Chicago between trains, I spent in the library, looking over<lb/>
old illustrated magazines, hunting for old pictures of yellow fever on my own.<lb/>
I came across quite a few which I had photostated, some were very striking. I<lb/>
also came across many more interesting illustrations and drawings in various<lb/>
old illustrated magazines, including some in an old New York daily illustrated<lb/>
newspaper. I really believe it might be profitable if you would consider the<lb/>
following suggestion.</p>
<p>I would suggest that if you can spare one of your trained personnel<lb/>
who knows what type of calls come to you, let her go systematically to the New<lb/>
York Public Library a half day a week or longer and just leaf through the old<lb/>
illustrated magazines and newspapers. I am sure in this way you could find<lb/>
many, many more items than you now have available. She could merely index them;<lb/>
you wouldn't even have to have them photostated now, you could merely make a file<lb/>
of what they are and a potential customer wouldn't even have to know that you<lb/>
didn't have them on hand. You could have them photostated when necessary and<lb/>
thus notably increase your stock. I have, on my own, probably found five times<lb/>
or more as many interesting items on yellow fever as you have in your stock.</p>
<p>I hope you do not believe me presumptuous in making this suggestion.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
