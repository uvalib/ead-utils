Dr. Eugene R. Whitmore,<lb/>
Army Medical School,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Whitmore:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was <hi>not</hi> glad to get your letter of the 23rd.<lb/>
I will probably leave this place on the <unclear>evening</unclear> of December 3rd.<lb/>
so I wont be able to hear your paper and I wanted to hear it.</p>
<p>What made you go back on yourself and not read<lb/>
it in January or February as you first said? I am keeping my word<lb/>
to be in Baltimore in the early part of December. I will arrive<lb/>
in the afternoon of December 5th. I would <del><unclear></unclear></del> like to have heard<lb/>
not only the paper but the debate on it on the Hopkins Pathologist,<lb/>
however I am so used to not getting what I want that I have really<lb/>
almost ceased to mind it.</p>
<p>I understand from Dr. Gorgas that Guiteras did<lb/>
not find any Yellow fever in or around Maracaybo but that he did<lb/>
find some cases, people whom he saw sick and on whom he did anti-<lb/>
topsis, at Coro.</p>
<p>He, Guiteras, thought the disease reported as<lb/>
Yellow Fever last November and December in Barbadoes to be Weil's<lb/>
disease but he did not prove it. If we accept the clinical descrip-<lb/>
tion and the epidemiology as given by the British Health Officer<lb/>
and by Guiteras later as correct<unclear><del>,</del></unclear> it was not yellow fever. There<lb/>
is al<del>most</del><add>ways</add> a chance of error however in judging all things we see<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00811061"/>
2<lb/>
from the eyes of nature because if we accept it it is a very big<lb/>
provisor</p>
<p>We have no laboratory diagnosis for yellow fever unfortunately<lb/>
and I not only confess that there are individuals cases which I cannot<lb/>
diagnosticate but assert that there are such cases in which the di-<lb/>
agnosis is impossible at present. On the other hand. I do not think<lb/>
there can be any considerable number of cases, as an epidemic, in which<lb/>
diagnosis is not possible.</p>
<p>When Gorgas wrote me last spring about taking up this work<lb/>
with Guiteras, I suggested taking Darling as the Pathologist of the<lb/>
party if he were available. If he would not I asked him to consult<lb/>
you or Dr. Welch for a Pathologist. A Dr. Taylor is with Guiteras<lb/>
in this capacity, of whom I know nothing except that he has done<lb/>
some very good work on the Cuban mosquitoes. The extra cantonment<lb/>
malaria work however rendered it impossible for me to go, although<lb/>
I would have given my years to have looked into the <unclear>socalled</unclear> &ldquo;Coun-<lb/>
try Fevers&rdquo; of the French Antilles and their <unclear>Fraver</unclear> Roja of Venezu-<lb/>
ela which I suspect comprise at least two or three epidemiological<lb/>
entities.</p>

<salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute>
