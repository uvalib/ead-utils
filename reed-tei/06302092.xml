<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was going to send you a<lb/>
letter to Florida but I have had a<lb/>
miserable 10 days with a nasal sinus<lb/>
and really was not able to do anything.</p>
<p>It is getting on nicely now and<lb/>
I thought I would be able to get<lb/>
this to Rochester about the time of your<lb/>
return there.</p>
<p>I have everything you sent me<lb/>
including the small maps. The Hammeter<lb/>
book went on to Gen. Kean by Railroad<lb/>
express about a week ago. My comments<lb/>
therein are frank and honest and express<lb/>
my opinions as they were formed 40 yrs.<lb/>
ago. I have no idea if Gen. Kean<lb/>
formed similar opinions or not. I<lb/>
fully believe that Carroll's statements<lb/>
after Reed's death, and those of Hammeter and,<lb/>
others influenced Kean to accept Agramonte's<lb/>
statement in the Senate Doc. But I shall<lb/>
always feel that he must have known<lb/>
at the time that they were at least exagerated<lb/>
and far from the truth. I have not written<lb/>
to Pinto and will await your efforts to<lb/>
draw out his statements. Then I do want<lb/>
to ask him a few questions.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06302093"/>
<p>AC<lb/>
T</p>
<p>Mr Kellogg sent me <del>a</del> copy of the<lb/>
sketch by the steps of the medical officers<lb/>
quarters. I have not made any<lb/>
comments as my views have been<lb/>
made clear and I do not want to<lb/>
influence those on the ground.<lb/>
Frankly, I have much fault to find<lb/>
with the last sketch. I think they should<lb/>
take more time and give the matter<lb/>
careful consideration.</p>
<p>Lyster's remarks to Ross are new<lb/>
to me but I give them very little<lb/>
credence. Ross must have been in<lb/>
Panama a dozen or more years<lb/>
after Lazear died. Gorgas and others<lb/>
would have quoted Lister years before<lb/>
if the statement were true. Lyster came<lb/>
to Cuba in 1899 as a Contract Surgeon<lb/>
and in 1900 took the army examination<lb/>
for a commission in the Med. Corps. He<lb/>
passed and Gorgas took him into his<lb/>
office doing Sanitory work. Lyster was<lb/>
a relative of Mrs Gorgas. He was not<lb/>
a Yellow Fever expert or even &ldquo;Expert,&rdquo;<lb/>
Perhaps Kean can give you more<lb/>
light on Lyster. He died a<lb/>
few years ago.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f06302094"/>
<p>J. H. Andrus has written up<lb/>
his story and asked my permission<lb/>
to quote some of the information<lb/>
I gave you for your address at<lb/>
W.&amp;.J. I gave him permission<lb/>
to do so, but suggested that he<lb/>
also ask if you had any <del>suggestions</del><lb/>
objections. No doubt you have<lb/>
heard from him. It is remarkable<lb/>
how he does such things considering<lb/>
his condition. I saw him at<lb/>
the Walter Reed Hospital 7 or 8 years<lb/>
ago and did not expect he would<lb/>
live very long.</p>
<p>I will be interested in learning<lb/>
of your trip and what new<lb/>
things you may have unearthed<lb/>
in Cuba.</p>

I have a nice letter from Col.<lb/>
Willis stating that they would set<lb/>
up the model to scale on a piece<lb/>
of actual terrain as soon as<lb/>
the weather &amp; their work would<lb/>
permit. Willis has just been<lb/>
made a Brigadier General and<lb/>
suppose he will be placed in Command<lb/>
at Carlisle.<lb/>
In your last letter you asked<lb/>
if I knew where the 1899 or 1900 maps<lb/>
of Camp Columbia could be found. Also<lb/>
the keys for same. I do not know.<lb/>
Suggest you write to the General<lb/>
Staff map. Collection (Officer in Charge)<lb/>
and ask if they Love them. Address<lb/>
him at the War Dept. Washington.</seg>
