<salute>My dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p><hi>Isnt</hi> Ireland a wonder!<lb/>
<hi>Pronto</hi> is still his name. When<lb/>
he got your nice letter of the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
by air mail he brought <add>it</add> over here<lb/>
to me in Georgetown, stuck it at<lb/>
me_ said &ldquo; here's a good letter from<lb/>
Truby about his Memoir. Read it<lb/>
&amp; think it over &amp; I'll be back<lb/>
tomorrow &amp; talk about it&rdquo; Havn't-<lb/>
time to stop now&rdquo; and he was<lb/>
off like a shot. This morning he<lb/>
came back, still in a hurry, but<lb/>
I made him sit down &amp; talk.<lb/>
We agreed that it would be just<lb/>
a worry and an expense to you<lb/>
to try and have it done by a Com-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06306088"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
2<lb/>
mercial publisher. In these exciting<lb/>
times there would not be enough<lb/>
sale for it to pay expenses and<lb/>
the publishers would make you pay<lb/>
the difference, including the adver-<lb/>
tisement, the cost of the type and<lb/>
storeage for the type till you got<lb/>
tired of that and gave it to them <hi>&amp;c.</hi><lb/>
So we considered the Military Sur-<lb/>
geon and the Bulletins of the S.G.O.<lb/>
I looked into the former &amp; he the<lb/>
latter. I formed that it would take<lb/>
about 110 pages of the Mil. Surg.<lb/>
and only 80 pages would be avail<lb/>
able in one issue without expanding<lb/>
that issue by 30 pages. They are<lb/>
going to print an expanded issue<lb/>
next month being a history of the<lb/>
Assn. Mil. Surgeons to celebrate<lb/>
their 50<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> anniversary. They are<lb/>
going deep into the hole to do this<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06306089"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
3.<lb/>
so it would not be reasonable to<lb/>
ask them to do this. Ireland took<lb/>
it up at the same time with Col.<lb/>
John A. Rogers <add>in S.G.O.</add> and turned over the<lb/>
 M SS to him. He said that on Ire-<lb/>
land's and Kean's say so he was sure<lb/>
it could be done but would read<lb/>
the M.S.S. at once and let us know.<lb/>
Then I will finish my review of<lb/>
it (which has been interrupted<lb/>
to let Ireland and Miss Laura<lb/>
Wood read it) and then I will<lb/>
send it back by air mail to you<lb/>
to make any small changes you<lb/>
wish &amp; then <add>you</add> will send it back here<lb/>
to Carlisle to be printed. We will<lb/>
ask them to print some extra copies<lb/>
so that the retired Medical Officers<lb/>
&amp; men like Dr. Hench can have copies<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06306090"/>
4<lb/>
you should give them a list of others<lb/>
to whom you want copies sent.<lb/>
I asked Ireland to impress on Col<lb/>
Rogers that we did not want it<lb/>
split between two issues. It should<lb/>
be all in one issue and I think<lb/>
they should <hi>bind them</hi> as they did<lb/>
Duncan's valuable books on the Med..<lb/>
Dept. in the Civil War&rdquo; and &ldquo;Med. Men<lb/>
in the Revolution&rdquo;. I think, with old<lb/>
Pronto on the job, we will get it down<lb/>
all right. (with two ls) I hope Pronto<lb/>
wont keep the <add>other copy too long from Dr. Hench</add> too long and wont remem-<lb/>
ber a lot of things that we think never<lb/>
happened. It is remarkable how perfect-<lb/>
ly good honest men do this, after many<lb/>
years. I had a letter from Amador,<lb/>
after I wrote the review of Hendrick's<lb/>
life of Gorgas in 1925 in which he said<lb/>
he remembered X.Y. S case perfectly - that<lb/>
he was in charge of the ward where X.Y.<lb/>
was laid up with <hi>a broken leg</hi> <unclear>&amp;c. &amp;c.</unclear></p>
<pb n="5" id="f06306091"/>
<p>5</p>
<p>2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.</p>
<p>I looked it up in the reports of S. &amp; W. in<lb/>
the War Dept. &amp; my recollection was that<lb/>
X.Y. had what the colored soldiers called<lb/>
<hi>Lady Fever</hi>. I can dig up Amador's<lb/>
letter &amp; send it to you if you would<lb/>
like to see it. I want to know what<lb/>
you get from Pinto. I have a high<lb/>
regard for him, but there was a rather<lb/>
wild article, or interview, from him<lb/>
published in the Washington papers some<lb/>
years ago when he made a move<lb/>
to be put on the Yellow Fever Roll of<lb/>
Honor in the Army Register. The reporters<lb/>
may have been responsible for most of<lb/>
that however. So I think we should be<lb/>
charitable, tho. not too credulous, of the recol-<lb/>
lections of old men about the long ago.</p>
<p>I have been very happy over the<lb/>
good news from the two <hi>Barbaras</hi>.</p>

<p>I find I can get it fresh and<lb/>
straight from Richard La Garde thru<lb/>
Ireland, who has his desk as Presi-<lb/>
dent of the Army Mutual Aid<lb/>
in La Garde's office and uses his<lb/>
office clerks.</p>
<p>I must stop &amp; get to some chores<lb/>
which are not so pleasant as<lb/>
remeniscing with an old friend.</p>
