<salute>Dear Johnny Moran,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter certainly reminds me that I never<lb/>
finished one which I started to write you when yours<lb/>
reached me on the island of Crete last spring. Please<lb/>
forgive me. I was glad to have yours and to put it<lb/>
away to keep among my precious documents. I did start<lb/>
to answer it at once and in the middle of it the type-<lb/>
writer got knocked on the floor and never was the same<lb/>
again and somehow I couldn't inflict my handwriting<lb/>
on you. A copy of YELLOW JACK goes forward, properly<lb/>
inscribed, almost at once. I doubt its being played<lb/>
in the movies, but it is being done all over the country<lb/>
as a play in different colleges and has had a great<lb/>
success in Holland and Stockholm and is probably going<lb/>
to be played presently in London, Moscow and Vienna.<lb/>
So you see that our story is getting about into some<lb/>
new territory.</p>
<p>I am sorry indeed to hear the bad news you<lb/>
report about yourself and I hate to think of your thinking<lb/>
of leaving your pleasant home in Havana. I remember wondering<lb/>
how you had come through the revolution and asking you about<lb/>
that when last I wrote you, but I had hoped that the Sun Oil<lb/>
Company was weathering the depression without too much dif-<lb/>
ficulty. I certainly will put my ear to the ground for a<lb/>
Latin American job, but my ear doesn't cover a great deal<lb/>
of ground on which the footsteps of such jobs are to be heard.<lb/>
If you come to New York you are certainly required to let<lb/>
me know -- I have said that before. The old address: 157<lb/>
East 82nd Street, is still good, though I am living here<lb/>
until June 1st. Every good wish to Mrs. Moran and to you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Faithfully yours,</salute>
<signed><hi>Sidney Howard</hi></signed>.
John J. Moran, Esquire.<lb/>
