<salute>My dear Dr Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>The papers of the correspondence between<lb/>
Gen. Truby and Lambert with your very interest-<lb/>
ing letter of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> came yesterday and I have<lb/>
read them carefully- I think that Truby's first<lb/>
impulse was the best-simply to file Lambert's<lb/>
letter and not answer it- It is all <hi>res adjudicata</hi><lb/>
It has been gone over thoroughly and judicially<lb/>
by General Ireland and later by you and a dici-<lb/>
sion made- No two men that I know could be<lb/>
more just- But the dicision did not suit Lambert-<lb/>
He has an <hi>id&eacute;e fixe</hi> and nothing except what he has<lb/>
in mind will content him- So why should we<lb/>
give him the encouragement of listening to him-<lb/>
Only one thing in his letter strikes me- That is that<lb/>
Dr. Ames's grave is unmarked by any stone-<lb/>
why should that be? His widow, when she came to<lb/>
see me about 20 years ago I think to get her<lb/>
husband's name added to the roll of honor, seem-<lb/>
ed to be prosperous and good looking, and she<lb/>
was on the government payroll as a clerk in the office<lb/>
of the Texas Senator who was on the Military Affairs<lb/>
Committee- She spoke of her two sons then in their teens<lb/>
I think- They should now be middle aged men. Why<lb/>
should they not see to it that Dr. Ames had a <unclear></unclear><lb/>
stone? If Dr. Brumby of Houston Texas, whom Truby<lb/>
mentions in his letter to Lambert, will take up a<lb/>
subscription to do what the family have failed to do-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06501127"/>
2<lb/>
I will be glad to be a subscriber for a modest<lb/>
amount-</p>
<p>I was surprised that Lambert should allude to<lb/>
Dr. Ames' performance at Fort M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Intosh on the<lb/>
Rio Grande, when he put an infected mosquito on a<lb/>
young soldier there- I think the less said about that<lb/>
matter the better for Ames' memory-</p>
<p>I think we are all agreed that any appropriation<lb/>
for Dr. Reed's memory should be handled by the<lb/>
Walter Reed Memorial Association as <del>that</del> it <del><unclear></unclear></del><lb/>
<del>it</del> was organized for that purpose, some 56<lb/>
years ago-</p>
<p>I think we should still call on the Surgeon<lb/>
General to defend the Y. F. Roll of Honor<lb/>
against intrusions, though the danger gets still<lb/>
less each year- That is also a duty of the<lb/>
W. R. Memo- Assn. and I think the Surgeon<lb/>
General should be reminded of it, the<lb/>
first time we have him at a meeting,<lb/>
he being now <unclear></unclear> a member ex officio-<lb/>
Well - now as to your engagements in April-<lb/>
Mrs Kean says that her plan was not to have<lb/>
the M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Coys give you a <unclear>dinner</unclear> but for us<lb/>
to invite the M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Coys to meet you at <unclear>dinner</unclear> here<lb/>
as she was desirous to meet you- But nothing<lb/>
has been said about that yet- We hope to see<lb/>
you when you come to Wash- but realize perfectly<lb/>
now you are tied up by engagements- We are going<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06501128"/>
3<lb/>
up to Wilmington on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to spend a week<lb/>
with Col. <unclear>Beal</unclear>, who makes this possible for<lb/>
me by sending down his car to my door, so all<lb/>
I have to do is to sit in it until I get out at<lb/>
his door 3 hours later- We expect to be home<lb/>
by the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> perhaps a day or two earlier-<lb/>
Well this has become quite a long letter- I get<lb/>
garrulous even with my pen- Now, since I<lb/>
have become rather &ldquo;hard of <unclear>hearing</unclear>,&rdquo; as the old<lb/>
people like to say, I find it easier to talk than<lb/>
to listen- I dont understand how your duodenal<lb/>
ulcer puts up with all the troubles you are<lb/>
taking on for April-</p>
<p>Please give our cordial regards to Mrs Hench<lb/>
and tell her that we look to her to keep the<lb/>
brakes on you-</p>

<salute>Affectionately Yours</salute>
