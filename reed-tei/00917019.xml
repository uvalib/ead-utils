<salute>Dear General Carter:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Knowing how deeply you have<lb/>
been interested in recent development<lb/>
in yellow fever research, I am writing<lb/>
to you certain data connected with<lb/>
D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cross's unfortunate death which occurred<lb/>
on Dec. 26, this year. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cross was a<lb/>
Ph. D. and not an M. D.; had some training<lb/>
in bacteriology and pathology at the Johns<lb/>
Hopkins. He was engaged by the International<lb/>
Health Board and sent to my laboratory<lb/>
to learn special technics for yellow fever<lb/>
bacteriology. He spent several months with<lb/>
me and was sent down to Mexico on<lb/>
November 23. He received rather a short<lb/>
notice to catch the boat and had not<lb/>
had enough time to get the vaccination.<lb/>

He managed to receive one injection, however,<lb/>
on the day he sailed (Nov. 23, 1921), and was<lb/>
to receive another on November 26 while on<lb/>
the sea. Somehow, he landed on Vera<lb/>
Cruz without the second injection, on Dec. 2,<lb/>
namely 10 days from the first injection. He<lb/>
received an injection on Dec. 3, intended <add>apparently</add><lb/>
to take <add>the</add> place of that <add>which</add> he missed on Nov. 26.<lb/>
Of course, this injection <del>can</del><add>could</add> not take <add>the</add> place<lb/>
of that he <del>neglected</del><add>missed</add>, because the effect of the<lb/>
first was already partly in force and the<lb/>
introduction of the second injection simply neutralized<lb/>
all whatever <add>protective substances that</add> had developed from the first injection.<lb/>
Not only that, <del>but</del><add>it</add> also produced a state of<lb/>
weakened resistance, so-called the negative<lb/>
phase of immunity, which usually lasts<lb/>
several days or perhaps 10 days. In order<lb/>
to establish the immunity it is usually<lb/>
necessary to give another injection of vaccine<lb/>
<unclear>within</unclear> a period of from 3 to 6 days. In<lb/>

other words, the process of vaccination must be<lb/>
done over once more. Cross should have<lb/>
received another injection on Dec. 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and<lb/>
<add>should have</add> waited, at least, 10 days longer before<lb/>
considering himself reasonably protected. But,<lb/>
(he failed to observe this rule) and <del>went</del><add>was sent</add><lb/>
to Tuxtepec on Dec. 7, 1921, just during<lb/>
the negative phase of the reaction. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White<lb/>
and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caldwell accompanied him on that trip,<lb/>
but on Dec. 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> both returned to Vera Cruz,<lb/>
leaving Cross in Tuxtepec alone. Tuxtepec<lb/>
is a small town with no railroad connection,<lb/>
<unclear>lying</unclear> about 100 miles from Vera Cruz and is<lb/>
reached by horse back and river boat. While<lb/>
D<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> White and Caldwell were still in Tuxtepec<lb/>
Cross made autopsy, on Dec. 8, on a<lb/>
suspicious case, but they believed the finding<lb/>
to be negative at that time. Anyhow,<lb/>

Cross was reported ill to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caldwell on<lb/>
Dec. 21 (?) and the latter reached Cross's<lb/>
bedside on Dec. 22. Cross was attended<lb/>
by a Tuxtepec physician by name of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Diaz<lb/>
from December 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> and <add>according to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caldwells' telegram</add> neither he<lb/>
nor D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Diaz realized the nature of the disease,<lb/>
until diagnosed by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caldwell on Dec. 22<lb/>
(according to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caldwell's telegram). D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
Caldwell did not bring any serum with<lb/>
him and none was available in Tuxtepec.<lb/>
On Dec. 23 Cross was brought back to<lb/>
Vera Cruz (100 miles on horse back, river<lb/>
boat, etc.) and placed under the care of<lb/>
D<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Caldwell, Loyo, and &ldquo;associates&rdquo; in the<lb/>
&ldquo;best hospital&rdquo; in Vera Cruz. No serum was<lb/>
administered because the disease was too<lb/>
far advanced in stage (according to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
Caldwell, 5 days already). On Dec. 26,<lb/>
the temperature was 38&deg;C., pulse 110, resp. 30,<lb/>

and 300 a. urine <add>was passed</add> by Catheter. He died at<lb/>
12.<hi rend="superscript">20</hi> p. m. All these details <del>were</del><add>have been</add> obtained<lb/>
from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caldwell by me through telegraphic<lb/>
communications since Dec. 25. I had<lb/>
no news of Cross's illness until that day<lb/>
and the announcement of his death was<lb/>
received in the afternoon of Dec. 26</p>
<p>Some side lights on the case are<lb/>
thrown by Cross's daily letters to his wife<lb/>
in New York. Cross slept under mosquito<lb/>
net all the time and never remembered<lb/>
of being ever bitten by any <add>mosquito</add>. He was able<lb/>
to write until <add>the afternoon of</add> Dec. 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and mentioned how<lb/>
well he was feeling and that he was rather<lb/>
annoyed by not having seen a single<lb/>
case of yellow fever yet. Of course,<lb/>
it is possible to have a letter dated a<lb/>
day wrong, ahead or behind, especially in<lb/>

a way out of place like Tuxtepec, but if<lb/>
his dates are correct, Cross must have been<lb/>
taken ill <del>on Dec. 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or</del> during the night<lb/>
of Dec. 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>; consequently <del>on</del><add>was in</add> his 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> day<lb/>
of illness when Caldwell reached <del>to</del> his<lb/>
bedside on Dec. 22. Serum could have<lb/>
been of some value if administered on<lb/>
that date. Unfortunately, none <del>was</del><add>had been</add><lb/>
<del>available</del><add>brought!</add>. (There was a sufficient<lb/>
amount of serum in D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caldwell's care<lb/>
at Vera Cruz as we made <unclear>in</unclear> certain<lb/>
by a Cable inquiry before Cross sailed from<lb/>
my laboratory). Somehow, Cross was<lb/>
taken by Caldwell back to Vera Cruz. It<lb/>
is still a mystery to me why Cross was<lb/>
carried <add>about</add> <del>by</del> 100 miles on his 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> day of<lb/>
yellow fever. I would appreciate very<lb/>
much if you <add>can</add> give <add>me</add> some tangible<lb/>

explanation for such an action by any<lb/>
physician. I always believed neat<lb/>
quickness was one of the most important<lb/>
factors in the treatment of yellow fever.</p>
<p>Thus, contrary to the press dispatches<lb/>
from Vera Cruz, that Cross was immediately<lb/>
taken back to Vera Cruz and given every<lb/>
known means to save him, we possess<lb/>
a few cold facts which must be<lb/>
carefully considered before we justify<lb/>
the press announcement. Certainly, neither<lb/>
the vaccine nor the serum has been given<lb/>
any chance to show itself in this most<lb/>
lamentable incidence in the history of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>I am very sorry, indeed, for Cross and<lb/>
his devoted wife and hope to get more<lb/>
light when <del>his</del><add>the</add> data <add>on his case</add> arrive.</p>

<p>In the future, I must counsel the organizers<lb/>
of any yellow fever expedition not to send<lb/>
a lone laboratory man into an <unclear>infected</unclear><lb/>
area, but at least, two &ldquo;medical men&rdquo;<lb/>
should be in the party. They ought to<lb/>
be together all the time. Besides, I<lb/>
believe that even a laboratory man should<lb/>
be an M. D. to join the expedition.</p>
<p>I have dealt in great length and must<lb/>
apologize for taking up so much <add>of your</add> time.</p>
<p>With my sincere thanks for<lb/>
your past considerations and in<lb/>
great admiration of your work,</p>

P. S. <unclear>It</unclear> was understood from the beginning<lb/>
that the <add>personal</add> protective measures by means<lb/>
of the vaccination are only supplementary<lb/>
to screening against the stegomyia<lb/>
bites. But, why can <add>not</add> this process be<lb/>
adopted as a routine just as much as<lb/>
screening is done where there is a danger?<lb/>
As to the serum it seems reasonable to<lb/>
think that any future expedition on yellow<lb/>
fever <add>should</add> be provided with it and use it<lb/>
on any case that may arise. It has not<lb/>
done any harm and showed decided<lb/>
reduction of mortality then employed within<lb/>
3 days of the disease. If you agree with<lb/>
my views I wish you would recommend<lb/>
such a step to the Board. If this were in<lb/>
force, Cross would not have been alone and<lb/>
the serum would have been with him<lb/>
anywhere he found himself.<lb/>
