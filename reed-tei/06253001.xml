REFER TO<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs Reed</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of March 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> was<lb/>
duly received and I have <unclear>procured</unclear><lb/>
and read the Chapter in The World's<lb/>
Work by Mrs Gorgas and Mr Hendrick-<lb/>
It is a very cleverly written article, &amp;<lb/>
apparently justifies the very <unclear>scanty</unclear> notice<lb/>
of the work of the Reed Commission<lb/>
by the statement at the foot of page 637<lb/>
&ldquo;The story of those next few months has fre-<lb/>
quently been told- It is the story of Reed<lb/>
and not the story of Gorgas&rdquo;- The dis-<lb/>
proval of Sanarelli's claim is credited<lb/>
to &ldquo;a group of Americans&rdquo; when it<lb/>
would have taken no more space to<lb/>
say &ldquo;The Reed Commission&rdquo;-</p>
<p>But people have a right to write their<lb/>
books in their own way and make<lb/>
omissions if they want to- They have<lb/>
no right to make false claims however<lb/>
as is done when they say at the end of<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06253002"/>
Chapter III In the next few months however<lb/>
" it was clearly to be shown that the stego-<lb/>
" myia, and the Stegomyia only, was the<lb/>
" infecting agent, and the man who was<lb/>
" to make this clear for all time was<lb/>
&ldquo;Gorgas himself&rdquo;- If there was one thing<lb/>
which Reed did do and Gorgas did<lb/>
not do it was just that thing!<lb/>
The first column of Chap. IV on page<lb/>
638 is pure <unclear>bunk</unclear>- We were all<lb/>
familiar with H. O. Howards methods<lb/>
of fighting mosquitos by kerosine-<lb/>
I had recommended it in Key West in<lb/>
1906 and had officially recommended<lb/>
mosquito work on Oct - 15 - 1900 - <unclear>G. O. No 6</unclear><lb/>
Dept Cuba on the same subject was published<lb/>
Dec 21, 1900 - Reed had no doubts at all<lb/>
on the subject of how the work could<lb/>
be done and my recollection is that<lb/>
he <unclear>outlined</unclear> it before Gorgas had<lb/>
accepted the mosquito theory.</p>
<p>But what to do about it I do not<lb/>
know - or who to get to do it- Prof<lb/>
Welch is the man but it is so hard<lb/>
to get him to write anything - and<lb/>

IN REPLY<lb/>
REFER TO<lb/>
especially anything of a controversial<lb/>
nature- And we all hate to attack<lb/>
the statements of a woman who is writing<lb/>
the biography of her husband-</p>
<p>I dont know what we can do- Gen-<lb/>
Ireland has written to me about<lb/>
your speaking to him but had not<lb/>
read the article when he wrote-<lb/>
My recollection is that Gorgas began<lb/>
his mosquito work in Havana in<lb/>
Feb- 1901 and its good effects did<lb/>
not became evident until May &amp;<lb/>
June- I will have to look up these<lb/>
points a little-</p>
<p>If Mrs Gorgas is going to put forth<lb/>
such claims as this she ought to have<lb/>
it intimated to her that her book<lb/>
will be sharply reviewed by the friend<lb/>
of Reed &amp; of truth- I will write again<lb/>
to Gen Ireland about it-</p>
<p>It is a great pleasure to hear from<lb/>
you- I think I wrote you of my pleas<lb/>
ure in seeing Lawrence Reed-</p>
