<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Miss Brown and I have gotten a <hi>lot</hi> done this week, inc<del>ul</del><add>lu</add>ding<lb/>
having the authority on early Italian at the Library of Congress<lb/>
go over the text of a good part of the account of &ldquo;The Portuguese<lb/>
Pilot&rdquo; (who first visited S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; in 1520) and that of Alvise C&agrave; da<lb/>
Mosto, one of the African explorers for Prince Henry of Portugal.<lb/>
We had already gotten things pretty well verified ourselves, but the<lb/>
verbatim quotations are too important<add>,</add> in both cases<add>,</add> not to get them<lb/>
<hi>&ldquo;ex cathedra</hi>,&rdquo; when, as has been the case in all our work, people<lb/>
specially qualified to help us along our different lines of inquiry,<lb/>
have been not only <del>ready</del><add>willi</add>ng, but eager to do so. In this connection,<lb/>
I got an extremely kind letter from Dr. L. O. Howard the other day,<lb/>
telling <add>me</add> not to hesitate to call on him at any time for any help that<lb/>
he could give me. The only person to whom I have applied from whom<lb/>
I have not heard is Dr. J. W. W. Stevens. I do hope he isn't sick.<lb/>
Mr. Neumann, of the Library of the Surgeon General, was at the Library<lb/>
of Congress yesterday and I gave him a duplicate of the references<lb/>
about which I had written to Stephens, which he says he will investi-<lb/>
gate in every <add>way</add> available to him. Miss Brown and I have already almost<lb/>
<add>&ldquo;</add>worked our heads off<add>&rdquo;</add> over them<add>,</add> <del><unclear>(so has Frost),</unclear></del> but perhaps Mr. Neumann<lb/>
may have better luck. Stephens was the method of election, as the<lb/>
references were to Bacot<add>'s</add> and to Stephens' own work (unpublished when<lb/>
Father wrote this part of the MS). Frost says, however, that it <hi>must</hi><lb/>
have been published subsequently, either under Stephens' name or in some<lb/>
report. Its needless to say that both methods of approach have already<lb/>
been tried--hard. Of course, we <hi>can</hi> put these refs. in the bibliogra-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0322070"/>
bibliogra-<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
phy as Father had it, i. e. as from personal communications and un-<lb/>
published MS, but, as Frost says, it will be much more satisfactory<lb/>
to the reader if we can cite matter in published form<del>.</del>, hence easy of ac</p>
<p>This is a bit early in the week to write, but Miss Brown, who<lb/>
has a half holiday, is coming up to work with me this afternoon, at<lb/>
my apartment. She will spend the night and we will begin again right<lb/>
after breakfast to<del>h</del>morrow (Thanksgiving Day). Well, I certainly have<lb/>
much to be thankful for in that the work is going so well. <add>This despite the<lb/>
fact that my digestion has been doing a <unclear>tailspin</unclear> for 21 days, that Ive <unclear>[unclear]</unclear><lb/>
in my <unclear>rt.</unclear> arm &amp; that <unclear>my left eye</unclear> is pretty well out of <del><unclear>commis</unclear></del><lb/>
<unclear>commission</unclear><lb/>
for the<lb/>
past six<lb/>
weeks.</add></p>
<p>Dr. Frost has a bad cold. or &ldquo;flu,&rdquo; I don't know which. At any<lb/>
rate, although he has been working on Father's MS since his return from<lb/>
Cincinnati, he does not yet feel that he wishes me to go over to<lb/>
Baltimore. Had a long talk on the subject night before last(long<lb/>
distance) with Mrs. Frost.</p>
<p><del>What of the &ldquo;Hun<del>&rdquo;</del> gentleman<add>&rdquo;</add> and his yellow fever &ldquo;cure?&rdquo; Not<lb/>
much, I fancy.</del></p>
