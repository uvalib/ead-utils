2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
WASHINGTON 7, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here are a couple of clippings which<lb/>
have been floating around on my<lb/>
desk for several days which I thought<lb/>
would amuse you. I remember Dr. Paul<lb/>
Mazzuri quite well in Cuba, but cannot<lb/>
recall any connection whatever with<lb/>
Walter Reed, or the Yellow Fever Episode.<lb/>
He was a nice fellow of average intelligence<lb/>
and about the last person I could think<lb/>
of to put forward such an astonishing<lb/>
claim. I last saw him when I ran across him<lb/>
in Paris, I think about 1912. As he was 82<lb/>
when he died he had arrived at the age<lb/>
when some men remember things that<lb/>
never happened. As to the reappearance<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06413037"/>
of Sidney Howard's <hi>Yellow Jack</hi>. I was<lb/>
invited to witness its first appearance but<lb/>
never saw it as I didnt have the cash<lb/>
to go to New York for that purpose.<lb/>
My impression is that it represented<lb/>
Lazear as having infected xy without<lb/>
his consent, which I do not believe.<lb/>
I have stuck in the Health News because<lb/>
I have for many years been reading Dr<lb/>
Paul B. Brooks weekly letter. &ldquo;<hi>Dr. Jones says</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
They are always sensible and usually amusing.<lb/>
A request to the State Dept of Health will bring<lb/>
it to you if you have two minutes a week to<lb/>
spare for it. We had a fine visit from the<lb/>
Irelands recently. He is still very lame<lb/>
but is always the same wise and good<lb/>
friend. He told me that now Col Siler<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06413038"/>
is out and driving his car. We agreed<lb/>
that our prayers must have helped towards<lb/>
his extraordinary recovery.</p>
<p>Are we not a fortunate nation to have<lb/>
a great and wise man like General<lb/>
Marshall to represent us at Moscow?<lb/>
And President Truman's fine message<lb/>
about Greece and Turkey! But you have<lb/>
no time to waste on political talk.</p>
<p>I am hoping from day to day that<lb/>
I will get a card from you to say:<lb/>
&ldquo;I have begun the Magnum Opus&rdquo; &ldquo;Am<lb/>
writing provisional chapter headings&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can you not take a Sabbatical year<lb/>
and devote yourself to the M.O. It is the<lb/>
only way that I can see for you to do it.<lb/>
I think that Dr. Harvey Cushing did this<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06413039"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
4<lb/>
in order to write his Life of Osler.<lb/>
You will necessarily have an assistant<lb/>
to sift out the grain from the chaff for<lb/>
you, and she could sift and classify<lb/>
&amp; make cross references. &amp;c. &amp;c.<lb/>
Good Lord what a job it is!<lb/>
I hope you will excuse my presumption<lb/>
in telling you what you ought to do<unclear>-</unclear><lb/>
but I am so interested that I cannot<lb/>
help it, and you are so good a friend that<lb/>
I know you will not be offended.</p>
<p>And anyway you do not have to<lb/>
answer this note, which began with<lb/>
the intention only to write one page and<lb/>
this is the fourth.</p>
