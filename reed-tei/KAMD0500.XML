<salute>My dear Doctor:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Replying further to your letter of the fourteenth in-<lb/>
stant, Assistant Surgeon Carroll states that &ldquo;Doctor Ames was<lb/>
never the subject of any attempt at experimental innoculation by<lb/>
the Army Yellow Fever Board. He was born and graduated in medi-<lb/>
cine at New Orleans and the very fact, as stated by Dr. Berry,<lb/>
that Doctor Ames was at that time regarded as a yellow fever ex-<lb/>
pert and an immune would preclude the idea of using him for any<lb/>
such purpose. The truth is that Doctor Ames was totally unaware<lb/>
of the first mosquito innoculations until the results were being<lb/>
compiled two months later, for publication.&rdquo; Doctor Ames was,<lb/>
however, in charge of Camp Lazear, the experimental yellow fever<lb/>
camp.</p>
<p>On account of his experience with yellow fever Dr. Ames<lb/>
was detailed for duty in Texas during the yellow fever outbreak<lb/>
there in 1903; in 1905 when yellow fever occurred in New Orleans<lb/>
he was in that city on leave, and upon his own urgent request was<lb/>
detailed for duty at Jackson Barracks as assistant to the Surgeon,<lb/>
Lieutenant William L. Little. In neither epidemic did the advice<lb/>
not to remove the troops originate with Dr. Ames.</p>
<p>In 1903 the Acting Chief Surgeon of the Department of<lb/>
Texas made the original recommendation, and in 1905, it was made<lb/>
by the Acting Surgeon General of the Army.</p>
<p>In regard to Dr. Berry's statement concerning the in-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fKAMD0510"/>
-2-<lb/>
fected mosquito incident, Dr. Carroll says: &ldquo;The last sentence in<lb/>
the fifth paragraph of Doctor Berry's letter clearly implies,<lb/>
without saying so, that the mosquitoes collected by Dr. Ames were<lb/>
used by me in showing that the so-called Myxococcidium stegomyia<lb/>
was neither an animal parasite nor the parasite of yellow fever.<lb/>
My results in this connection were embodied in a paper presented<lb/>
at the meeting of the American Public Health Association in Wash-<lb/>
ington, October 26th to 30th, 1903, and published in the Journal<lb/>
of the American Medical Association, November 28, 1903. The rec-<lb/>
ords of this laboratory show that the first lot of mosquitoes re-<lb/>
ceived from Doctor Ames at Laredo arrived at this laboratory No-<lb/>
vember 27, 1903; it is therefore absolutely impossible that they<lb/>
could have been used for the purpose stated, indeed these insects<lb/>
were not sectioned until some months later and were then found to<lb/>
be worthless. The demonstration was actually made from infected<lb/>
mosquitoes preserved chiefly by myself in Havana and from non-in-<lb/>
fected mosquitoes raised from eggs in Washington, with others re-<lb/>
ceived through Doctor O. L. Howard and Doctor Edmond Souchon, to<lb/>
both of whom acknowledgements are made in my paper mentioned above.&rdquo;</p>
