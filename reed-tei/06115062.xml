Miss Laura Wood<lb/>
1338 Nineteenth Street N. W.<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
My dear Miss Wood:</p>
<p>For four years I have been trying to get two complete sets of<lb/>
Kelly's book. I never was able to find the third edition. When I visited<lb/>
Dr. Kelly this Spring I asked him if he knew where I could get one and<lb/>
the upshot of it was that he insisted on my taking his only copy, which<lb/>
was his own personal one. I felt rather embarrassed by this generosity<lb/>
but he insisted that I use it, as a future biographer of Reed. He auto-<lb/>
graphed it for me and therefore I prize it most highly.</p>
<p>I am sending it to you by separate post and would ask that<lb/>
you keep it very carefully and return it to me at your convenience. I<lb/>
did find a couple of copies of the second edition. I had planned to<lb/>
send one of each edition to be kept at the Washington and Jefferson<lb/>
College at the Lazear Memorial, but at the present I think you should<lb/>
have it. Therefore, I am sending it to you to keep, with my best wishes.<lb/>
Should you be successful in picking up one like it some time (no hurry)<lb/>
you might trade it for this one, but at any rate I am glad to have you<lb/>
have it.</p>
<p>I am waiting very impatiently for word from the New York Academy<lb/>
of Medicine. I wired Malloch today after he did not answer my letter of<lb/>
last week. But I had a positive print of your photostat made here and airmailed<lb/>
it to Mrs. Lazear, explaining briefly and hurriedly how it had been discovered.<lb/>
I have just this minute received an airmail letter with the following: &ldquo;There<lb/>
is not the slightest doubt in my mind but that the writing in the photostated<lb/>
copy you enclose is the handwriting of my husband, Dr. Lazear.....&rdquo; Thanks<lb/>
again greatly for your interesting collaboration and help and in return I<lb/>
am delighted to serve you in any way that I can.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<lb/>
P. S. Hench, M. D.<lb/>

Dear Dr. Hench:</p>
<p>I was so touched and surprised and happy to receive<lb/>
the Reed book which you so kindly inscribed to me<lb/>
last Saturday. I shall value it, and all your kind-<lb/>
nesses, most highly.</p>
<p>I've gone over the two extra chapters in the 3rd<lb/>
edition and made notes on everything I was inter-<lb/>
ested in in them, so shall return it immediately<lb/>
so as to beat the Christmas rush. Surely Kelly is<lb/>
in error when he says on page 132, in his chapter<lb/>
on Sternberg, that after becoming Surgeon General<lb/>
on May 30, 1893, he put Reed at the pathological<lb/>
laboratory at Hopkins. According to the memoran-<lb/>
dum the SG's office made for General Kean, Reed<lb/>
was in Minnesota until the end of August, and then<lb/>
went straight to Washington. It's a very persis-<lb/>
tent error. Dr. Flexner also told me when I saw<lb/>
him in New York that Sternberg had sent Reed to<lb/>
Hopkins, and so did Dr. William Howard, who wrote<lb/>
me a long letter about Reed from Hopkins. Another<lb/>
thing I'm having a hard time checking on is Reed's<lb/>
first interval at Hopkins when he was stationed at<lb/>
Ft. McHenry from Feb. 24 to May 2, 1881. Dr. How-<lb/>
ard said he must have worked with Newell Martin in<lb/>
the physiological laboratory, but Dr. Wm. H. Howell<lb/>
who was there at that time as a student says he<lb/>
doesn't remember him, although he thinks he would<lb/>
had he been there, and that he isn't listed in the<lb/>
Johns Hopkins Circular for that year. Do you think<lb/>
Dr. Kelly is mistaken about it?</p>
<p>I had intended to write and thank you yesterday,<lb/>
but the commotion was so utter that I couldn't get<lb/>
my mind back to it. I am, incidentally, especially<lb/>
pleased with the stamp - I hadn't seen one of them<lb/>
before <add>- and with <unclear>your marginal</unclear> note.</add>. It seems rather trivial to go on working on<lb/>
a children's book, under the circumstances, but as<lb/>
a friend of mine, a lawyer, remarked on leaving for<lb/>
New York on a case last night, &ldquo;They also serve who<lb/>
only litigate.&rdquo; Thank you, again, so much - I am<lb/>
delighted beyond words to have the book.</p>
<p>Cordially,<lb/>
Laura Wood<lb/>
Write <unclear>re old Jules</unclear><lb/>
