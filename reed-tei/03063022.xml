<p>Yellow Fever</p>
<p>From July 28 to Sept. 15, 1922, eleven new cases of yellow<lb/>
fever with six deaths have been reported. Seven of the cases<lb/>
were at P&aacute;nuco and the others at Tampico, the latter town<lb/>
being infected from the former. This new outbreak of yellow<lb/>
fever--the last case had been in March, in the southern part<lb/>
of the state of Vera Cruz--may be explained through the<lb/>
existence of endemic centers at some small towns. As there<lb/>
are usually no physicians in such communities, the infection<lb/>
is kept alive by children and nonimmune adults from other<lb/>
places. A real diagnosis is made only when an outsider gets<lb/>
sick and is attended in some medical center, and thus the<lb/>
infective focus is located. On other occasions, the first cases<lb/>
are overlooked, as the usual diagnosis is &ldquo;hemorrhagic mala-<lb/>
ria,&rdquo; a disease which is generally neglected, and thus the<lb/>
existence of cases of yellow fever is unknown until the<lb/>
patient is finally seen by some painstaking clinician. Besides<lb/>
enforcing prophylactic measures most rigidly, it has been<lb/>
decided to make malaria a notifiable disease whenever hem-<lb/>
orrhages occur during the course of the disease. Thus, an<lb/>
end will be made of an anomalous situation, as suspicious<lb/>
cases will be carefully investigated and laboratory tests<lb/>
made, and epidemic outbreaks will be discovered and con-<lb/>
trolled in time.</p>
<p>Seventh Mexican Medical Congress</p>
<p>Because of several obstacles, the organizing committee of<lb/>
the medical congress to be held at Saltillo was forced to<lb/>
postpone the inauguration date to September 23. The con-<lb/>
gress will close on the 29th. So far, about 300 physicians<lb/>
have announced their intention of attending, and a number<lb/>
of them will submit papers. It is expected that this meeting<lb/>
will be a complete success both because of the large atten-<lb/>
dance and the prevailing enthusiasm among physicians, and<lb/>
because of the moral and material assistance rendered by the<lb/>
national government and the state of Coahuila.</p>
