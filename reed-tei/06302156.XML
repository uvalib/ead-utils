Dr. R. S. Galbreath<lb/>
16 W. Washington St.<lb/>
Huntington, Indiana<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Galbreath:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I hope you will not mind my intruding with the affairs of Mr.<lb/>
and Mrs. Kissinger. I have known them for some years and have admired Mr. Kissinger<lb/>
for his service to humanity and his simple, lovable character. I was at the meet-<lb/>
ing in Cleveland with him two days before he had his stroke. I sincerely hope you<lb/>
will not think me presumptuous for discussing his case with you.</p>
<p>First of all, I shall appreciate knowing just what his condition<lb/>
is. Mrs. Kissinger told me that he had a very severe stroke, was paralyzed on his<lb/>
right side and that he had notable speech and even some visual impairment. In her<lb/>
letters to me, she complains rather bitterly about her own difficulties and seems<lb/>
to be much distressed that her backache and other symptoms prevent her from taking<lb/>
proper care of Mr. Kissinger. Regardless of how much she is ailing, I am thinking<lb/>
primarily of Mr. Kissinger and wondering whether you would think his condition such<lb/>
that he will probably never recover the use of his limbs or perhaps not for months.<lb/>
If this eventuality faces him, do you think he would rather be confined to his<lb/>
home, surrounded by friends, or do you think he might be better off, at least for<lb/>
a while in some army or veterans' hospital. Mrs. Kissinger infers that they do not<lb/>
have enough money for her to get any help and that it is most difficult for her<lb/>
to take care of him. I have not breathed a word to Mrs. Kissinger about my<lb/>
suggestion as to hospitalization elsewhere, as I of course wanted to discuss the<lb/>
matter with you, but if you think he is badly and permanently incapacitated and in<lb/>
need of hospital care, perhaps we could set in motion arrangements to get him in<lb/>
a nearby veterans' hospital or even in Walter Reed Hospital in Washington. Most<lb/>
of the army men in the medical department know of Mr. Kissinger and I think they<lb/>
might out red tape and do what they could for him. Perhaps I am wrong, but at least<lb/>
I wanted to get your reaction to this. As to the matter of transportation, that<lb/>
would of course depend on his condition and whether or when you thought he might be<lb/>
moved, either by train, ambulance or plane.</p>
<p>As I said before, I don't want to intrude in the professional re-<lb/>
lationship you have with him but I don't imagine he is any financial help to you<lb/>
and I have no doubt that you would be glad to share the burden of his care.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
