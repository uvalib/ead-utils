<salute>My dear Sis;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your very welcome letter<lb/>
came two days ago, &amp; should have been<lb/>
answered immediately. When I read the<lb/>
names of <hi>eight</hi> of your children who<lb/>
are living &amp; remembered that you had<lb/>
lost two, I could hardly believe it! The<lb/>
mother of 10 children! Great Scott! Enough<lb/>
for one woman, surely- I then tried to<lb/>
calculate your age and put you down<lb/>
as being not more than 41. Was that<lb/>
about right? Did you know that you<lb/>
wrote on my birth-day? I guess<lb/>
that you had forgotten it? By the way,<lb/>
Can you, Oh! Can you remember the<lb/>
dates on which your flock were<lb/>
each born? But, of course, not!<lb/>
Yes, I was thirty-one years of age<lb/>
on September 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. I can't blame you<lb/>
for not remembering it, for I like<lb/>
to have forgotten it myself. I suppose<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f13910002"/>
that Nita, your eldest in the flesh, is<lb/>
now 21, she having been born in<lb/>
1861, if I am correct. Like the shy maidens<lb/>
generally, I suppose she puts herself<lb/>
down as about 17! How is that? And<lb/>
this leads me to the subject of your letter-<lb/>
To send you <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>50.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> now, my dear Sis, would<lb/>
be beyond my power. I am just on the<lb/>
'eve of being ordered West &amp; am compelled<lb/>
to save every dollar possible to take my<lb/>
family there and make them comfortable.<lb/>
Although my salary is a good one, I have<lb/>
to spend <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>20 where you would only spend<lb/>
one. But, of course, you know this- I have<lb/>
just received a new uniform for which I<lb/>
must pay, &amp; Emily &amp; the boy require a com-<lb/>
plete outfit. The only time that I have<lb/>
been able to <del>save</del> <add>help</add> anyone was last Christ-<lb/>
mas, when I sent Tom a present of <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>50<lb/>
as being the most needy of the family- Two<lb/>
years ago, I loaned Kit all of my savings<lb/>
amounting to about <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>450, none of which he<lb/>
has been able to return. So you perceive that<lb/>
I am not what the boys call &ldquo;<hi>flush</hi>.&rdquo;<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f13910003"/>
I owe Pa at present <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>125 of a sum<lb/>
of <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>200 which I was compelled to borrow<lb/>
from him when suddenly ordered away<lb/>
from Fort Ontario in February 1881.<lb/>
Living in Washington has been more<lb/>
expensive than <add>at</add> any place where I have<lb/>
ever been stationed. So much for business.<lb/>
I would not offer any advice further<lb/>
had you not asked for it. First let me<lb/>
say that Nita would have been much<lb/>
more delicate than she is at present had<lb/>
she been constantly kept as school- Fe-<lb/>
male education, my dear Sister, makes<lb/>
no provision for that wonderful change<lb/>
than is going on in every girl's system<lb/>
from the ages of 13 to 20. At the very<lb/>
time when the growth of the brain is<lb/>
so terribly stimulated by <del>the</del> study, there<lb/>
are other organs that should mature<lb/>
&amp; that should be given the fullest op-<lb/>
portunity to mature- I felt very sorry<lb/>
when I read that Lallie was going to try<lb/>
for so many medals! It's a triumph <hi>now</hi>
<pb n="4" id="f13910004"/>
but ill-health &amp; pain <hi>hereafter</hi>, <add>I wish I could talk to you on
this subject-</add> No girl<lb/>
should study at certain times of every month.<lb/>
At such a time, the whole body including the<lb/>
<hi>mind</hi> should be given entire rest. Physi-<lb/>
cians know this &amp; are beginning to preach<lb/>
it. Send your girls to school, but don't<lb/>
let them try to <hi>excel</hi>; that is, if they ever expect<lb/>
to become mothers! You see that I speak<lb/>
plainly to you, as I am sure that you<lb/>
appreciate it. I would not worry any<lb/>
more about Nita's education- Certainly<lb/>
her health would not permit her to follow<lb/>
teaching? Would it? Is that the object of her<lb/>
continuing her studies? I write hurriedly,<lb/>
my dear Sister, but my opinion of the present<lb/>
system of educating girls, has been formed<lb/>
after considerable reading &amp; much thought.<lb/>
Let me hear from you again soon --<lb/>
Emily &amp; boy join me in much love<lb/>
to you &amp; your family- Ever your fond</p>
<closer>
<salute>&amp; affectionate brother</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
