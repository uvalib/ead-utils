Habana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs. Phillips:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You certainly were a great help to me on my recent visit to Cuba,<lb/>
more of a help than you realize. I have been extremely anxious to get air<lb/>
plane pictures of the location in Quemados which is historically related to<lb/>
the Conquest of Yellow Fever. As I wrote you, I have been unable to get<lb/>
these anywhere after a long search. I had thought myself of asking the Cuban<lb/>
Air Force to take the pictures but just didn't have the nerve <del>b</del>without your<lb/>
encouragement. Doctor Nogueira of Quemados, took me to meet first the medical<lb/>
officers at Ciudad Militar and then the Air Force officers. They were ex-<lb/>
tremely<del>n</del>kind and promptly arranged to have the pictures taken for me. How-<lb/>
ever, when the pictures were not forthcoming after several days, I looked up<lb/>
Antonio Perez Benitoa as you suggested. He was most courteous and hunted<lb/>
around and found eight fairly good air views. He most kindly loaned these<lb/>
to me and I had them copied here. They were really pretty good. However, if<lb/>
you can find the name and address of the man who took the original films, I<lb/>
should still like to get in touch with him and borrow the originals which are<lb/>
always much clearer than copies. Didn't you think his name was Leo Hamburg?<lb/>
I would certainly appreciate your further help in this matter.</p>
<p>Since my return, the Army air views arrived. One is especially<lb/>
good and I am delighted indeed to have them. Even so, I should like to locate<lb/>
the original films taken by Mr. Hamburg.</p>
<p>When, in the course of human events, I finish my book, it will be a<lb/>
real pleasure for me to express my indebtedness to you by sending you a copy<lb/>
which you can use as a door stop or a paper weight or for any other purpose<lb/>
which seems agreeable.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
