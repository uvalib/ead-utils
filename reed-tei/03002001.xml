Senator Robert L.<lb/>
Owen, U.S. Senate, Wash. D.C. My dear<lb/>
Senator Owen: As you have already<lb/>
shown your interest in perpetuating<lb/>
the memorial of Major Walter Reed by<lb/>
the introduction last year of S. 8024<lb/>
for the erection of a statue to him,<lb/>
the Surgeon General has requested me<lb/>
to write and ask your assistance for<lb/>
the same object in a more modest way.</p>
<p>The Surgeon General's Office is<lb/>
constantly in receipt of requests<lb/>
from various parts of the country and<lb/>
occasionally from abroad for litera-<lb/>
ture describing the work of the Yel-<lb/>
low Fever Commission, and we have been<lb/>
accustomed to send various reprints<lb/>
of articles written by Reed in ans-<lb/>
wer to such applications. Some of<lb/>
these, however, are out of print and<lb/>
the Surgeon General has therefore got-<lb/>
ten all the publications descriptive<lb/>
of his work or connected therewith<lb/>
for publication in a single volume<lb/>
entitled &ldquo;Major Walter Reed and the<lb/>
Yellow Fever Commission - A Compila-<lb/>
tion.&rdquo; It will make a thin book of<lb/>
about 300 pages. The Surgeon General<lb/>
has, however, no means of publishing<lb/>
it, and it has occurred to us that<lb/>
you might get through a resolution<lb/>
authorizing its publication and dis-<lb/>
tribution by the Surgeon General. This<lb/>
office would like about 400 copies<lb/>
for distribution in addition to those<lb/>
that might be wanted by Members of<lb/>
Congress, especially southern Members,<lb/>
for distribution <add>to</add> their constituents.</p>
<p>Hoping that you can help us out<lb/>
in this matter and that you are very<lb/>
well, I am,<lb/>
3--958<lb/>
Write nothing below this line.<lb/>
Yours very sincerely,<lb/>
J.R. Kean.<lb/>
B.M.I.</p>

various <add>articIes</add> by Major Walter Reed, U.S.A.,<lb/>
and the Yellow Fever Commission as<lb/>

or with the plate from which it is<lb/>
printed, it would be much appreciated.</p>

Mr. Charles Mercer,<lb/>
Secretary to Senator Robert L. Owen,<lb/>
Senate Office Bldg. (Room 339)<lb/>
Dear Mr. Mercer: In accordance with<lb/>
the suggestion in your kind note of<lb/>
Jan. 16, I am sending herewith the<lb/>
manuscript of the Compilation on Maj.<lb/>
Walter Reed and the Yellow Fever Com-<lb/>
mission which the Surgeon General<lb/>
desires that Mr. Owen will have pub-<lb/>
lished in order to supply the con-<lb/>
stant demand for information with re-<lb/>
gard to this great work.</p>
<p>It is proposed to put in the pic-<lb/>
tures of the members of the Commis-<lb/>
sion, but only the picture of Reed has<lb/>
been as yet secured. The others will<lb/>
be obtained by the time the manu-<lb/>
script is put into page proof.</p>
<p>If for any reason the Senator<lb/>
should find it impossible to secure<lb/>
authority to publish this compilation<lb/>
it is requested that you notify the<lb/>
Surgeon General or the undersigned so<lb/>
that the manuscript can be returned<lb/>
as there is no retained copy.</p>
<p>Please give the Senator my re-<lb/>
gards and best wishes.<lb/>
Sincerely yours,<lb/>
J.R.K., Lt. Col. M.C., U.S.A.<lb/>
