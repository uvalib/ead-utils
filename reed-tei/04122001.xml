Bethesda, Maryland<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Leake:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Our mutual friend, Dick Hewitt of our Editorial Department here,<lb/>
knows of my considerable interest in the work of Walter Reed and his<lb/>
associates. For some years, I have been collecting date thereon in prepara-<lb/>
tion for a book. I have been extremely fortunate--the Reed family and<lb/>
the Lazear family have made me the repository of all their letters, et<lb/>
cetera. Just last week I was in Washington and had dinner with General Reed<lb/>
and his sister, Blossom. The next day I visited Mrs. Walter Reed, who<lb/>
is still living in Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania--almost ninety-one<lb/>
years of age. While in Washington, I also had a pleasant day with<lb/>
Mrs. G. O. Gawne, who was a first cousin of Doctor Lazear. This summer, in<lb/>
California, I visited Lazear's son and daughter, having previously visited<lb/>
his widow (who died in February). Some important letters of Reed and his<lb/>
colleagues were given away by the family and others, of course, the family<lb/>
never had. If you have any such letters that I could have photostat<lb/>
copies of, or at least copies, I would be most happy to be permitted to<lb/>
have them and would be glad to pay whatever expense is required to copy<lb/>
them. By separate post I am sending you a reprint of mine on the subject.</p>
<p>Incidentally, we have discovered the lost Camp Lazear with<lb/>
building No. 1 in which Reed did the famous experiments. You will find a<lb/>
picture of it in the reprint. I have long hoped to start a campaign to<lb/>
preserve the little building by erecting over it a small museum. The<lb/>
Mayo Clinic is back of me in this venture--also the Walter Reed Memorial<lb/>
Association. Can you give me any advice on how to go about such a cam-<lb/>
paign? Do you think that the United States Public Health Association<lb/>
would help me in the venture, either as an organization or through its<lb/>
individual members? The Fiftieth Anniversary of the Conquest of Yellow<lb/>
Fever will be in 1950. Wouldn't it be a grand thing if, in connection<lb/>
therewith, a Cuban--American medical museum could have been erected on the<lb/>
site of Camp Lazear?</p>
