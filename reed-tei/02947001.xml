DEPARTMENT OF SANITATION<lb/>
Ancon, Canal Zone,<lb/>

<salute>Dear General O'Reilly:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have had my talk with Goethals and everything has been settled amicably<lb/>
between us. McCulloch's cable was due to a radical reorganization which Goethals had<lb/>
ordered. Two days after giving order he revoked it. He tells me that he does not<lb/>
intend to give any orders to the Sanitary Department. That what he says is sugges-<lb/>
tive and that if I act upon it, I assume the entire responsibility. His entire at-<lb/>
titude has changed to me and we are now on more friendly terms than at any time in the<lb/>
past. He denies flatly to me that he has ever made any criticism of my administra-<lb/>
tive ability or the administration of my department and says that he does not think<lb/>
any criticism is sustained by the conditions. The whole conversation was a complete<lb/>
change of attitude and I think some time you would be interested in the details.<lb/>
If Goethals stands to what he says my position will be much stronger than it has ever<lb/>
been since I have been on the Isthmus and I am more than satisfied.</p>
<p>I hear that one of my principal assistants saw a cable to Goethals signed by<lb/>
the President, telling him not to make changes in the Sanitary Department. I expect<lb/>
to see this man in a day or two and find out more about it. The cable was said to<lb/>
have been received on the 4th. I saw the President on the 8th.</p>
<p>What has occurred I think is this: When Taft was here Goethals proposed a<lb/>
radical reorganization for the whole work. Taft agreed to all except Blackburn's<lb/>
department. This department was not touched. When Taft got back to Washington he<lb/>
submitted the matter to the President. The President kicked. I know he wanted to<lb/>
keep Jackson Smith. Taft finally persuaded him to yield on everything except the<lb/>
Sanitary Department. That the President cabled with regard to the Sanitary Depart-<lb/>
ment and Goethals revoked his orders. If this is the case I will not stand much show<lb/>
after Roosevelt goes out.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f02947002"/>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>Goethals has completely reorganized everything on the Isthmus except the<lb/>
Blackburn's and my department, and everything is in a ferment. This reorganization<lb/>
in general seems to me good. But he has done it without gloves. I think I could<lb/>
have put on a pair of gloves and done it without creating the row that he has.</p>
<p>Please remember me most cordially to Mrs. O'Reilly.</p>
<p>Phillips and Lyster are both working themselves thin over their examination.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
