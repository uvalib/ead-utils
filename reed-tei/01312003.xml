<salute>My Dear Daughter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>There is no earthly reason why you sh'd<lb/>
not do &ldquo;setting up exercises&rdquo; now. Indeed I<lb/>
thought we agreed that you would begin them af-<lb/>
ter the first 4 or 5 days in bed Tomorrow. or-next<lb/>
day - will complete your 14 days days rest any<lb/>
way, &amp; glad am I that you are better. Even if<lb/>
you <hi>did</hi> have some indigestion while at rest, yet<lb/>
you will, on account of the rest, have less <del>n</del> next time-<lb/>
I felt sure that it would benefit you.</p>
<p>About your coming here I don't know- The<lb/>
complete <hi>change</hi> would he no end of a bene-<lb/>
fit to you - there is little doubt of that - &amp; you<lb/>
would like the people - much I think - especially<lb/>
Sally, you would have a chance to ride quite<lb/>
often &amp; very good <unclear>horses</unclear> too, &amp; they - the Misses C.-<lb/>
occasionally go bathing in Piney River - riding<lb/>
<unclear>thereto</unclear>,- so you w'd have to bring your bathing<lb/>
suit. On the other hand there is the food prob-<lb/>

problem- Everything is good- but I fear not <hi>to you</hi><lb/>
digestible: vegetables - Potatoes: beets: cabbage:<lb/>
string beans: some tomatoes &amp; corn rice, <unclear>stewed</unclear><lb/>
(green) peaches &amp; apples occasionally; Blackberry<lb/>
Jam: milk: Butter-milk &amp; coffee &amp; <hi>good</hi> butter.<lb/>
The bread is corn bread - <hi>not</hi> <unclear>batter</unclear> bread - &amp; biscuits.<lb/>
&amp; generally <unclear>underdone</unclear> <unclear>i. E</unclear> <hi>white</hi> - buiscuits. Have<lb/>
&ldquo;light bread&rdquo; occasionally - &amp; always <hi>very</hi> good-also<lb/>
sometimes the buiscuit are good &amp; hard - well<lb/>
done - quite often since I praised that kind.<lb/>
Possibly enough you could <unclear>make</unclear> out, as I know Sally<lb/>
would. <del>d</del> meet every special desire you would ex-<lb/>
press - only one does not like to express them.</p>
<p>She is as nice a girl as one usually <unclear>seek</unclear> - nicer indeed<lb/>
There is also a fair number of <unclear>fees</unclear> - not a great<lb/>
r<lb/>
number - &amp; I judge that they interfere with sleep in<lb/>
the day time or even rest, Breakfast is about<lb/>
8.15 to 8.30 usually. Have had chicken 3 times - 2 fried<lb/>
&amp; one stewed, no beef or Mutton.<lb/>
The nights &amp; mornings are cool. Dew lays to about<lb/>
10. or 10.30 A. M, &amp; after that it is <hi>hot</hi> in the day<lb/>
time, sometimes a breeze - there is one now - &amp;<lb/>
more often not, The house party - <del>M</del> Nannie's<lb/>
sister &amp; 3 children - have left.</p>
<p>About myself. I have put off writing because<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01312005"/>

I did not know what to say. (1) I have been carefully<lb/>
<del>over</del> &amp; <hi>slowly</hi> over my M. S S. for the Oxford<lb/>
Press - so as <unclear>to be</unclear> ready for the Galley Proof - &amp;<lb/>
the one for Nelson etc, <del>On</del> I have however about<lb/>
an hours work on the latter yet to do. I will do this<lb/>
tomorrow A. M. Have not bothered myself<lb/>
working - except <hi>2</hi> half days - otherwise, I mean<lb/>
at other times it has been rather an advan-<lb/>
tage to me. <del>N Worked</del> Have returned - yesterday<lb/>
- the <add><del>was</del></add> address before the H. Officers - &amp; answered<lb/>
Dr Blanch, Epler &amp; Hoffman - the same day.</p>
<p>It was too hot - to walk much yesterday or Fri-<lb/>
day. Indeed F. I felt <unclear>sleepy</unclear> - all day. Possibly<lb/>
from <unclear>reading</unclear> too late - <hi>12</hi> o' clock - the previous<lb/>
night, &amp; nearly as late the one before &amp; possibly from<lb/>
a walk of I judge <hi>2</hi> miles Thursday after-<lb/>
noon, taken with no rest except to <unclear>pick</unclear> black-<lb/>
berries-. However I was not tired - although<lb/>
rather wet - when I returned I did not feel<lb/>
like laying down until bed-time 3 1/2 hours<lb/>
later. I also am doing setting up exercises<lb/>
<unclear>8 sets</unclear> of them - 25 times each. By the way those<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01312006"/>
C1<lb/>
<unclear>B20</unclear><lb/>
4<lb/>
that strengthen the abdominal muscles are the<lb/>
most important for <unclear>you.</unclear></p>
<p>Today - I went out - about 9.<del>30</del><add>15</add> - <del>&amp; wa</del> the dew was<lb/>
less than hitherto - &amp; walked over a mile &amp;<lb/>
a half &amp; am back, rather moist but <hi>not</hi> tired.<lb/>
So I almost think I am well. <del><unclear>It</unclear></del> It is too <hi>hot</hi> to<lb/>
try myself out - but I feel quite sure that I<lb/>
can do 1 1/2 miles twice a day - with out fatigue<lb/>
or 2 miles at time. I find too that I am, wal-<lb/>
king at nearly - not quite - my normal <unclear>gate</unclear>. In-<lb/>
deed I was beginning to do so before I left <unclear>Balt.</unclear></p>
<p>I am thinking then of coming back - say - Aug 1<lb/>
or July 31: Setting up with the Y. F. (<unclear>Nelson</unclear>) ar-<lb/>
ticle &amp; going on duty. I <hi>think</hi> I can do so without<lb/>
<add>any</add> risk at all. That is my present plan - but my<lb/>
decision is not settled as yet.</p>
<p>If I don't <del>go</del><add>come</add> you might consider coming here. I<lb/>
have told you about how things are. They suit<lb/>
me well enough - all but the hot weather-<lb/>
but I am &ldquo;tougher&rdquo; than you. If you remember<lb/>
you did well on coarse food at Chevy Chase. Still<lb/>
<hi>I</hi> don't want to risk <del>your</del> what you have <unclear>gained</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01312007"/>
5<lb/>
in your digestion. because I hope the gain will be<lb/>
-by taking much pains &amp; it may be for some time-<lb/>
permanent. And that my dear is worth giving<lb/>
much for: <unclear>Confound</unclear> Gertrude Williams any way.</p>
<p>I can't go about to our fishing holes &amp; the play places on<lb/>
the Summer Hill plantation - they are too far for this<lb/>
weather - 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 miles off. George of course goes on<lb/>
an artificial leg &amp; <unclear>crutches</unclear>. He is <hi>not</hi> suffering<lb/>
from diabetes now, only is very aenemic &amp; his<lb/>
face is puffed - as from <unclear>Ch.</unclear> Bright's Disease <unclear>"</unclear> He is<lb/>
I judge going to live <unclear>sometime-</unclear> in months or even<lb/>
<add>a few</add> years-. &amp; die suddenly.</p>
<p>I am going to return your poetry in this as soon<lb/>
as I have time to reread it.</p>
