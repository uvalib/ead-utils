<salute>Dear Mary</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is Easter Sunday, On the same <add>day </add>of 1920, although it was<lb/>
in March. I was able to tell Simona Quiroz, at Payta, that bar-<lb/>
ring accidents, Dr Q., would recover - this being the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> day of his<lb/>
fever, I remember her gratitude, as if <hi>I</hi> had done it! The night before<lb/>
about 2 P.M. I had gone to see a child of the Alcalde, <unclear>Franencia</unclear><lb/>
Reygada by name - stopped <hi>3</hi> kind of medicine &amp; removed 4<lb/>
large mustard plasters &amp; fed her ice until she went to<lb/>
sleep, I think, maybe, I did save <hi>her</hi> life, but by what I stopped<lb/>
rather than <add>by</add> what I did. That isn't long ago. Yet it seems ages<lb/>
since I boarded the Hullaga at Payta on April 3 the<lb/>
<hi>s</hi>ame year &amp; saw Gorgas for the last time.</p>
<p>Mrs Gorgas returned from Havana Friday where she had<lb/>
been as the guest 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of the Am Minister &amp; 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>of the Presi-<lb/>
<hi>d</hi>ente. Alfredo Zayas, whom I used to know.</p>
<p>I am glad that Mr. Hendrix accepted some of the quasi sug-<lb/>
gestions I made in &ldquo;Gorgas in Habana&rdquo;. He put in a compli-<lb/>
ment, to Finlay instead of speaking slightly of him as he<lb/>
had it. Indeed he left out <hi>all</hi> of the objectionable parts,<lb/>
but it still has three fundimantal error's of state-<lb/>
<hi>m</hi>ent, which I hope will not be in the book.</p>
<p>I made no change in his text, authors are nearly as tem-<lb/>
premental as Artists (Prima Donnas &amp; c) &amp; I felt sure<lb/>
that he would not like that. I marked <add>it</add>with a very soft pen-<lb/>
cil &amp; very lightly (1): 2: (3) &amp; c &amp; wrote on <del>a</del> separate sheets <hi>infor-<lb/>
mation</hi> on the subject of these clauses, <hi>marked <add>in th</add> the same<lb/>
way</hi>. So that, he would know what were the <hi>facts</hi> &amp;<lb/>
<del>could me</del> could make such changes as t<del>he</del><add>his</add> <del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del><lb/>
added knowledge justified. He readily expunged all ob-<lb/>
jectionable matter from his paper. Owing<lb/>
Owing<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC035006"/>
2m,<lb/>
Owing to some Rochefeller publication what I don't know<lb/>
young Carlos Finlay <add>sometime ago</add> wrote a letter to the N.Y. Times<lb/>
about the refusal of credit <del>to his</del> due his father from the Ar-<lb/>
my Board, &amp; Mrs Gorgas, says there is a perfect <hi>Cult</hi><lb/>
of F. in Cuba now, leading to a strong Anti-American<lb/>
feeling. This of course is foolish, yet Finlay did not receive<lb/>
credit from the Reed Board which was due him, &amp; I sus-<lb/>
pect that <hi>I</hi>, myself, in my article on Y. Fever <del>In</del>in &ldquo;The<lb/>
Practice of Medicine in the Tropics&rdquo; - got out by<lb/>
the Oxford Press of London &amp;, N York <del>is</del><add>gave</add> the first <del>on</del><lb/>
proper appreciation of Finlay's work in any <hi>book</hi>,<lb/>
except by a Cuban, Col Byam, the editor, objected to<lb/>
putting it in, &ldquo;as the scheme called for nothing historical&rdquo;<lb/>
I advised him, that, &ldquo;unless this <del>could</del><add>can</add>go in, I would ask him<lb/>
to return the rest of the M.S. also,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frankly, I doubt if Finlay's work <add>greatly</add> influenced the direction of<lb/>
Reed's experiments. He <hi>said</hi> that they did not in any way. I can<lb/>
not think this quite true however.</p>
<p>This, the <hi>nature</hi> of the experiments, (on men) were determined,<lb/>
by my paper (the one I wrote at North River in the winter of<lb/>
1898 when Carter and I Chloroformed &ldquo;Basic&rdquo; &amp; took the great<lb/>
splinter out of his foot). This <del>in act</del><add>is</add> stated by Reed in his first<lb/>
Report. &amp; is generally accepted by French &amp; British writers &amp;<lb/>
by the leader's of American Medicine - like Osler, Welche<lb/>
Thayer &amp; C. Moreover, &amp; of greater importance <hi>I</hi>know it <hi>my-<lb/>
self</hi>, &amp; count myself to have been greatly blessed<lb/>
&amp; am very thankful to God to have had a part <del>and</del><lb/>
and an essential part - in a work so beneficial to<lb/>
men. Of course the beginning of the discovery da-<lb/>
tes back to Dr. Salmon Chief of the <add>US</add> Vetenarian Bureau<lb/>
in <hi>about</hi> 1890-5, then (&amp; to a less extent) to<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fC0305007"/>
to McCallough of Hopkins thence Ronald Ross' <add>1895 to</add> 1898 in India<lb/>
then myself 189<del>2</del><add>3</add> to 18<del>8</del><add>9</add>9 in the U.S. Finally the Capstone<lb/>
was put in the arch by Reed 1899-1900. The <hi>negative</hi><lb/>
proof by Gorgas, Cruz: Connor &amp; Hanson &amp; many man since<lb/>
that date. It is not <del>given to may</del> often given to any<lb/>
one man to begin &amp; entirely complete a great discov-<lb/>
<hi>e</hi>ry.</p>
<p>About <del>Fil</del> Finlay I will say this however that if I had, in<lb/>
1999 read all he had written I would have <hi>urged vehe-<lb/>
mently</hi> experiments on men and called for volunteers<lb/>
<hi>to</hi> determine the truth of his theory of conveyance</p>
<p>Similarly if I had known of Ross' malaria work, when I pub-<lb/>
lished my article, (it was sent on in Jan 1999) I would have<lb/>
claimed definitely <del>instead of suggesting</del>, that y. f &amp; Malaria<lb/>
were conveyed by the same mechanism - instead of<lb/>
suggesting that Texas Cattle Fever &amp; Y. F. were convey-<lb/>
ed the same way. That, <del>R</del> Lazear: Reed: Durham &amp;<lb/>
Walter Mayer (the last <hi>2</hi> from Liverpool School of Tropical<lb/>
medince in Havana en route to Para when mayer quickly died<lb/>
of y. fever) <del>all made <hi>this</hi> deduction of</del> knowing <add>of</add> Ross's<lb/>
work, <hi>all</hi> made this deduction. i.e., &ldquo;that the mechanism<lb/>
of the conveyance of Malaria &amp; of y.f. were the same or sim-<lb/>
ilar&rdquo;. Shows I think, that <del>a kn</del>with a knowledge of Ross's findings<lb/>
my work gave the key to the problem &amp; <hi>determined</hi> the direc-<lb/>
tion of Reed's experiments, which were <hi>absolutely</hi> conclu-<lb/>
sive that y. f. was conveyed from the sick to the well by the<lb/>
<add>bite of a</add> stegomyia mosquito, itself infected by feeding on the sick</p>
