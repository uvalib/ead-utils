<date value="1930-01-29">January 29, 1930.</date>
</dateline>
Honorable Morris Sheppard,<lb/>
United States Senate.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Senator Sheppard:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I again refer to your letter of December 31,<lb/>
1929, receipt of which has heretofore been acknowledged, suggest-<lb/>
ing that there be added to the record of service of Dr. Roger P.<lb/>
Ames, assistant surgeon, United States Army, which was furnished<lb/>
you by the War Department on December 27, 1929, a record of his<lb/>
service in Cuba in connection with yellow fever experiments con-<lb/>
ducted by the yellow fever board under the direction of Major Wal-<lb/>
ter Reed in 1900-1901.</p>
<p>For your convenience I have embodied the in-<lb/>
formation furnished you on December 27, 1929, in the following<lb/>
statement which contains such additional information as the re-<lb/>
cords of the War Department afford:</p>
<p>It is shown by the official records that Roger<lb/>
P. Ames served under contract as acting assistant surgeon, U. S.<lb/>
Army, from May 14, 1898, to November 30, 1898, when his contract<lb/>
was annulled. He again entered into contract as acting assistant<lb/>
surgeon April 15, 1899, and his contract was annulled April 26,<lb/>
1901, in order that he might accept a volunteer commission as cap-<lb/>
tain and assistant surgeon.</p>
<p>During his service under this latter contract,<lb/>
while stationed at Camp Lazear, the yellow fever experimental camp<lb/>
established in Cuba by the Yellow Fever Board, he performed duties<lb/>
of a purely administrative character, and as one of the medical<lb/>
officers on duty at Columbia Barracks, Cuba, he had professional<lb/>
charge of experimental cases of yellow fever, but there has not<lb/>
been found in the War Department or in the published papers of the<lb/>
Yellow Fever Board (Senate Documents 822, 61st Congress, 3d Session.<lb/>
Serial No. 5919) any evidence to show that Dr. Ames took part in<lb/>
the actual experiments of the Board, and it is deemed proper to add<lb/>
that his service was not of such a character as to warrant the en-<lb/>
try of his name on the Roll of Honor provided for in Act Public<lb/>
No. 858, 70th Congress, approved February 28, 1929, an act to recog-<lb/>
nize the high public service rendered by Major Walter Reed and those<lb/>
associated with him in the discovery of the cause and means of trans-<lb/>
mission of yellow fever.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03230002"/>
<p>From <unclear>Mrs. Ames</unclear></p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>It is suggested if the official papers referred<lb/>
to in your letter of December 31, 1929, afford any additional evi-<lb/>
dence of the service of Dr. Roger P. Ames that they be turned over<lb/>
to the War Department where they would be available at any time in<lb/>
the future that it might be desired to furnish a complete record<lb/>
of the service of Dr. Ames.</p>
<p>In addition to the services as contract surgeon<lb/>
above cited Roger P. Ames was appointed major and surgeon of volun-<lb/>
teers January 6, 1902, and was honorably discharged from service<lb/>
February 1, 1903, a major and surgeon of volunteers. He again en-<lb/>
tered into contract as acting assistant surgeon February 27, 1903,<lb/>
and his contract was annulled March 15, 1907.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Patrick J. Hurley (S)<lb/>
Secretary of War</signed>
