<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am just about coming out from under the great<lb/>
deal of material which you were good enough to send to us<lb/>
for possible use in the program, and after a long session<lb/>
with Dr. Angell, in which we carefully considered every<lb/>
piece of material on its own merit, we have decided to<lb/>
use the following:<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. The reproduction of the birthplace--In this<lb/>
instance we are using not the copy which you were good<lb/>
enough to send, but a photostat which we received from the<lb/>
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which is larger and<lb/>
has a few more interesting details. When our printer has<lb/>
made his cut, we shall be pleased to turn this photograph<lb/>
over to you for your archives, or procure another copy<lb/>
from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for you.</item>
<item>2. The photostat of Camp Lazear, the experimental<lb/>
sanitary station near Quemados, Cuba. (Your No. 6a). You<lb/>
say this was procured from the United States Army Medical<lb/>
Museum of the Surgeon General's Library in Washington. I<lb/>
assume, therefore, that the courtesy line should read &ldquo;By<lb/>
courtesy of U. S. Medical Museum, etc.&rdquo;</item>
<item>yes</item>
<item>3. The photograph showing the remains of building<lb/>
No. 1 taken in Cuba by you in March 1948, and the little<lb/>
smoke stack of building No. 1. (Your No. 11b) Inasmuch<lb/>
as you yourself took this photograph, we shall run the<lb/>
courtesy line as follows: &ldquo;By courtesy of Dr. Philip S.<lb/>
Hench, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.&rdquo; If you do not<lb/>
approve of this wording, please give me your own suggestions.</item>
<item><unclear>Very small<lb/>
print so as<lb/>
not to detract<lb/>
from photo</unclear></item>
<item>yes</item>
<pb n="2" id="f04214025"/>
<item>Dr. Philip S. Hench</item>
<item>-2-</item>
<item>April 9, 1948</item>
<item>4. The photostat of the wood cut (your No. 3C)<lb/>
which you procured from the Bettmannarchives. I communicated<lb/>
with Dr. Bettmann and I have persuaded him to permit us to<lb/>
use this gratis, as well as the photostat of the &ldquo;Exodus<lb/>
from Newport News caused by the Yellow Fever Outbreak&rdquo;<lb/>
(your No. 3d), of course <hi>giving him the courtesy</hi> line.</item>
<item>yes</item>
<item>5. The Reed photograph while he was en route to<lb/>
Cuba in 1900 to do his yellow fever work. (Your No. 5b)<lb/>
I understand you procured this photograph from Mrs. Reed.<lb/>
I assume you mean the widow. If I am wrong, please advise<lb/>
me and also tell me whether I am to say &ldquo;By courtesy of<lb/>
Mrs.<unclear><add>Walter</add></unclear> Reed&rdquo; or &ldquo;By courtesy of Dr. Philip S. Hench.&rdquo;</item>
<item>Nice to know<lb/>
<unclear>still leaving</unclear></item>
<item>both? ask<lb/>
<unclear>gen Reed</unclear></item>
<item>6. The photographs of Lazear, Carroll, Agramonte<lb/>
and Finlay (Your No. 25), and with these photographs, perhaps,<lb/>
the Walter Reed stamp for which I have written today to the<lb/>
Postmaster General in Washington. These photographs, to-<lb/>
gether with the stamp and the full length photograph of Reed<lb/>
in civilian clothes will make an interesting page. I hope<lb/>
you will agree with us.</item>
<item>7. Walter Reed General Hospital--As I told you<lb/>
before, we received a very fine copy from the Metropolitan<lb/>
Life Insurance Company, and we shall be happy to turn this<lb/>
over to you, or get another copy for you for your own<lb/>
archives after the program has been printed. In connection<lb/>
with the reproduction of this photograph, will you be good<lb/>
enough to tell me, if you can, without going to too much<lb/>
trouble, when the Walter Reed General Hospital was established<lb/>
in honor of Reed, in order that I may include this with the<lb/>
photograph of the hospital.</item>
<item>8. A letter from General Reed to Major J. R. Kean<lb/>
(now General Kean) dated September 6, 1900, which came to<lb/>
us from the Surgeon General's office. This, of course, will<lb/>
be credited to the Surgeon General's office. In any case,<lb/>
I have written to Colonel McNinch, General Bliss's assistant,<lb/>
asking him for the proper courtesy line.</item>
<item><unclear>jr?</unclear></item>

see</item>

<unclear>long have original</unclear><lb/>
or photostat</item>

<item>Dr. Philip S. Hench</item>
<item>-3-</item>
<item>April 9, 1948</item>
<item>9. Letter from Walter Reed to Mrs. Reed dated<lb/>
October 6, 1900 (your No. 13). I have seen this letter, or<lb/>
parts of it, in some of the books that I have gone through<lb/>
on Reed, but I cannot remember which one offhand. However,<lb/>
inasmuch as you sent it to us, would it not be proper for<lb/>
me to merely say &ldquo;By courtesy of Dr. Philip S. Hench&rdquo;, or<lb/>
do you think I will become involved with the publishers of<lb/>
one of the volumes?</item>
<item>no place else<lb/>
photograph<lb/>
yes</item>
<item>10. Editorial of November 2, 1900 in the Washington<lb/>
Post (your No. 21).</item>
<item>11. Letter from Walter Reed to Mrs. Reed dated<lb/>
December 9, 1900. This photostat came to me from the<lb/>
University of Virginia. To whom should this be credited<lb/>
in the program? It is your material which I assume was<lb/>
merely being housed at the University of Virginia. If I<lb/>
am incorrect, and the University of Virginia should have the<lb/>
credit line, please so advise me.</item>
<item>P S H.</item>
<item>12. Washington Post editorial of December 22, 1900<lb/>
(your No. 22). This we are reproducing in its entirety.</item>
<item>13. Letter from Walter Reed to Mrs. Reed dated<lb/>
December 31, 1900 (your No. 17). Who is to receive credit<lb/>
for this letter? Of course it appears in Kelly's book, and<lb/>
in several others, but here again since the letter is actually<lb/>
in your possession, I suppose you should really have the<lb/>
courtesy line.</item>
<item>no place else<lb/>
<unclear>photo</unclear></item>
<item><unclear>Mrs.</unclear> Reed &amp;<lb/>
P S H?</item>
<item>14. Letter from Walter Reed to Dr. Howard dated<lb/>
January 13, 1900 (really 1901)--your No. 20. Again, I have<lb/>
seen this letter reproduced in several volumes but think<lb/>
you should have the credit line inasmuch as you have the<lb/>
original letter.</item>
<item>No, write<lb/>
<unclear>Mr Howard</unclear></item>
<item>15. Notes from &ldquo;Walter Reed. A Memoir&rdquo; by Walter D.<lb/>
McCaw published by the Walter Reed Memorial Association in<lb/>
1904. These notes give the details of the experiments that<lb/>
were made and briefly sum up the principal conclusions of<lb/>
the board of investigators.</item>
</list></p>
<p>And last, but not least, the insert of the Cornwell<lb/>
painting which Wyeth is furnishing. Of course, the courtesy<lb/>
line will appear for Wyeth giving them full credit.</p>

<p>April 9, 1948</p>
<p>In addition to all of the above, we are reproducing<lb/>
on one page estimates of Reed by Dr. William H. Welch,<lb/>
General Wood and General Gorgas. All of these are included<lb/>
in the dedicatory address which General Kean made at the<lb/>
dedication of the birthplace, and which appeared in &ldquo;The<lb/>
Military Surgeon.&rdquo; I have written to Washington asking<lb/>
for permission to reproduce parts of these appraisals.</p>

Roll of Honor</p>
<p>I know this is a very long letter for you to wade<lb/>
through, but you know how important it is to have these<lb/>
courtesy lines appear and appear accurately, in order that<lb/>
we may not become involved legally in any respect, and for<lb/>
this reason I hope you will pardon this additional intrusion<lb/>
upon your time and your good nature. I am now sending the<lb/>
material to the printer to have the cuts made, and I would<lb/>
therefore appreciate your kind response.</p>
<p>With every good wish to you, and my reiterated<lb/>
thanks, believe me</p>
