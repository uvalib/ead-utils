<title>Letter from Albert E. Truby to Philip Showalter Hench, May 17, 1942</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Truby is not convinced that Hench's specialty is needed in the armed services at this time. He also tells Hench that he has heard of Andrus' death and credits Andrus with having provided a reliable account of the &ldquo;events in Cuba.&rdquo;</p>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter was awaiting me on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
when I arrived here from New York. I remained<lb/>
there longer than I had expected to stay. Now<lb/>
I have to change my plans again and<lb/>
will be in Washington for at least a<lb/>
couple of weeks before returning here.</p>
<p>I was so glad to learn that you were able<lb/>
to take your mother home with you and that<lb/>
she was improving.</p>
<p>Regarding your entry into the service for<lb/>
work along the lines of your specialty, I<lb/>
fee<del>t</del><add>l</add> that you really are not needed yet<lb/>
for that work. Later on when men in large<lb/>
numbers are returning from foreign service<lb/>
there no doubt will be many suffering from<lb/>
rheumatic conditions. The S.G. will then<lb/>
probably have send <add>cases</add> cared for at some<lb/>
special hospital, possibly at Hot Springs, and<lb/>
your services at such a place would be most<lb/>
valuable. Your impediment of speech should<lb/>
not, in my opinion, interfere in any way<lb/>
with the fine service you can render to<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06310094"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
2<lb/>
the Government.</p>
<p>Hillman and Lull are good sound<lb/>
men and will know best when and how<lb/>
you can best serve in this emergency.<lb/>
I doubt very much if there is any<lb/>
rheumatic problem at the present time.<lb/>
The Army just now is dealing with young<lb/>
physically fit men. Only under the<lb/>
Stress &amp; Strain of Lord campaigns would, (I think)<lb/>
there be much likelyhood of rheumatic<lb/>
conditions on a large scale. Of course,<lb/>
I am speculating on this from past experience<lb/>
and am not qualified to give you the<lb/>
news of the S.G.O.</p>
<p>In other words I feel that you will be<lb/>
needed in time, but that there is nothing<lb/>
urgent at present to demand your entry<lb/>
into the service.</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p>My address in Washington will be: --<lb/>
1831 Summit Place N.W.</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p>I may go to Atlantic City for the A.M.A.<lb/>
If not I may be able to see you either<lb/>
in Washington or Philadelphia. Rutledge<lb/>
is a hard place to get to and I would<lb/>
be glad to come to Phila. to see you if I<lb/>
am at Rutledge at that time.</p>

<p>I have just learned that J.H. Andrus<lb/>
died on May 1, for dilatation of the<lb/>
right ventricle. Autopsy showed a<lb/>
tumor in the upper cervical region of<lb/>
the Spinal Cord about 5 mm. in diameter.</p>
<p>In my opinion his memory of the events<lb/>
in Cuba was more reliable and accurate<lb/>
than any I was able to obtain from<lb/>
other sources.</p>
<p>Our 45<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> reunion was a most<lb/>
enjoyable affair and your story the &ldquo;Conquest<lb/>
of YF&rdquo; was responsible for my being<lb/>
called upon for quite extensive remarks </p>
<p>Let me know your plans for your<lb/>
trip to the A.M.A. and I will do my<lb/>
best to arrange my affairs so that<lb/>
I can meet you.</p>

<salute>Very Sincerely</salute>
