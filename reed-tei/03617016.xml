Office of the Secretary of the War Department<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Gentlemen:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been asked to give an address on the conquest of yellow fever, on<lb/>
the occasion of the dedication of the Lazear Memorial Building, at Washington and<lb/>
Jefferson College, Washington, Pennsylvania, October 26. In preparation for this<lb/>
address, I recently visited Cuba to interview survivors of the United States Army<lb/>
Yellow Fever Commission. While there, I was amazed to find that the Cuban government<lb/>
has successfully carried on a campaign which ignors the work of Reed and the Army<lb/>
Commission and insists that Finlay was robbed of his true glory, and definitely and<lb/>
completely proved the cause of yellow fever. To further this campaign, Dominguez<lb/>
wrote quite a <unclear>book</unclear> on this theme and just this week, the Oxford University Press in<lb/>
New York has published a book by Finlay's son, to prove his father's contentions.</p>
<p>One of the problems I encountered in Cuba was connected with locating the<lb/>
true site of Camp Lazear. The Cuban government has raised about $200,000 (so I<lb/>
understand) to erect a memorial on the supposed site of Camp Lazear. I am absolutely<lb/>
sure they have chosen the wrong place, and Moran (one of the original volunteers for<lb/>
experimental yellow fever) and I were able to relocate the true site of the camp.<lb/>
So interested were members of the Cuban government that the Secretary of Defense,<lb/>
Dr. Ramos, and the Secretary of Health, Dr. Moya, asked me to submit a formal report<lb/>
to the Cuban government on my findings.</p>
<p>I have had much help from many people in Cuba, and many in this country,<lb/>
including General Kean and General Truby. The proper identification of Camp Lazear<lb/>
and the blasting of the identification of the false camp involves getting a map as of<lb/>
about 1900 of Camp Columbia, to show the site of the camp in relation to an adjacent<lb/>
railroad track. I have had considerable correspondence with Mr. R. S. Webster,<lb/>
Divisional Engineer of the Havana Railroad, who has shown me some maps and helped me<lb/>
greatly, but we are both at the end of our rope as the old Havana maps show the railroad<lb/>
but not the exact location of Camp Columbia in 1899, or of Columbia Barracks as of<lb/>
1900 or 1901. Mr. Webster tells me that the United States, at the time of the first<lb/>
intervention made maps of the whole island, including Camp Columbia and its environs.<lb/>
I would appreciate it greatly if you would ask some member of your department to look<lb/>
up these old maps for me, and if at all possible, send me copies of those which show the<lb/>
exact site of Camp Columbia and Columbia Barracks. I am emboldened to ask for this real<lb/>
favor, not for personal reasons, but because I want to see to it that the work and the<lb/>
place where the Army Commission did the work is properly memorialized, and I am sure that<lb/>
you, the War Department, will be most sympathetic to my plans.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
