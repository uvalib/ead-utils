<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your good letter of July 16th. would have been acknowledged earlier,<lb/>
had I not gone over to Baltimore for the past week-end, in order to talk<lb/>
over, with Dr. Frost, the work remaining to be done on the History of<lb/>
Yellow Fever so that we might send you a rough estimate of the time<lb/>
necessary therefor.</p>
<p>Dr. Frost and I thank that, barring unforeseen circumstances, I<lb/>
should be able to move back to Baltimore about the early or middle part<lb/>
of September, at which time he hopes and expects to be able to start<lb/>
work on the final editing of the revised MSS. This work he thinks can<lb/>
be finished about the early part of November. It would seem then that<lb/>
we should should be able to send in the MSS to you sometime in Novem-<lb/>
ber <hi>provided</hi> nothing happens to prevent Dr. Frost taking up the final<lb/>
editing at the time he has planned.</p>
<p>Naturally, sending in the MSS is not the end of our work: There<lb/>
will still be the galley proof and page proof, which it is essential that<lb/>
we go over, and the indexing, which cannot be done until one has the page<lb/>
proof. Dr. Frost does not think that the indexing should take long,<lb/>
however.</p>
<p>The work on the bibliography is still being pressed to the utmost,<lb/>
and with very satisfactory results. In this connection, Miss Brown and I<lb/>
both deeply appreciate what you say about not working too hard in hot<lb/>
weather, but so far we have managed to turn in considerably more than the<lb/>
average cold-weather amount of work, despite the heat, which has been<lb/>
terrific. This, by working early in the morning: late at night and by<lb/>
the lavish use of electric fans. Of course, it has been hard physically--<lb/>
very hard at times--but it has also been tremendously satisfactory. <del>etc.</del><lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0322029"/>
Satisfactory--<lb/>
Of Miss Brown's efficiency and devotion to the work I cannot say too much.<lb/>
Without her help the work on the bibliography would have taken at least<lb/>
twice as long to reach its present status. We're expecting to put on a<lb/>
&ldquo;night shift&rdquo; at my apartment this evening, in which connection--bless&eacute;d<lb/>
be the man who invented electric fans!</p>
<p>I am looking forward with much pleasure to seeing you in September<lb/>
and do hope that by now you are having a cooler time of it in New York<lb/>
than we are here in Washington. Last Friday most of the Government buildi<lb/>
ings closed at 1 P. M. on account of the heat (which the newspapers report<lb/>
ed as 104). This time also, however, Miss Brown and I &ldquo;put it across&rdquo;<lb/>
by working late at night, but even then Washington was &ldquo;a good place<lb/>
not to be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With very best remembrances, and onece more with sincere appre-<lb/>
ciation of your letter of Jyly 16th. I remain,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>
