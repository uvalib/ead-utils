<p>FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY</p>
<p>Reprinted from &ldquo;Medical Progress,&rdquo; March 1928</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Republic Remembers</p>
<p>James E. Peabody</p>
<p>OUR Republic is not always forgetful; and the<lb/>
stigma of apparent ingratitude will be forever<lb/>
detached from it by one act of our Congress this<lb/>
winter, if the pending Copeland-Wainwright Bill re-<lb/>
ceives the merited public backing to insure its pas-<lb/>
sage.</p>
<p>The bill not only advocates suitable pensions for<lb/>
the survivors of the yellow fever experiments carried<lb/>
on by Walter Reed and his associates in Cuba in<lb/>
1901, but it makes provision that never again in our<lb/>
history can such deeds of heroism go unnoticed. It<lb/>
empowers the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian<lb/>
Institution hereafter to recommend to Congress suit-<lb/>
able pensions, awards, or other recognition, to citi-<lb/>
zens employed in the service of the United States<lb/>
&ldquo;who through voluntary risk of life and health shall<lb/>
have rendered conspicuous service to the people of<lb/>
the country.&rdquo; This act will put the heroes of peace<lb/>
and progress on a par with those of war and disaster,<lb/>
so far as national recognition is concerned.</p>
<p>This bill is the direct outcome of the present wide-<lb/>
spread interest in helping the survivors of the yellow<lb/>
fever experiments, and their dependents. The deeds<lb/>
of these men are typical of the kind of services that<lb/>
our country is eager to acknowledge. After the close<lb/>
of the Spanish-American War, yellow fever broke<lb/>
out among the American soldiers in Havana. A<lb/>
commission to investigate its cause and transmission<lb/>
was appointed, consisting of Major Walter Reed,<lb/>
Dr. James Carroll, Dr. J. W. Lazear and Dr.<lb/>
Aristides Agramonte.</p>
<p>Major Reed decided to investigate a theory that<lb/>
the disease was transmitted by mosquitoes. Volun-<lb/>
teers were called for and they permitted themselves<lb/>
to be bitten by mosquitoes which had previously bit-<lb/>
ten yellow fever patients. Lazear was exposed to a<lb/>
contaminated mosquito, unintentionally, and died in<lb/>
convulsions. Carroll almost died of the disease. The<lb/>
experiments were continued on eleven men, and two<lb/>
of them contracted yellow fever.</p>
<p>Then Reed and his associates established an ex-<lb/>
periment station named Camp Lazear. Here the<lb/>
first volunteer to be bitten under strictly experi-<lb/>
mental conditions by contaminated mosquitoes was<lb/>
John R. Kissinger, who developed a typical case of<lb/>
yellow fever, from which he later recovered. This<lb/>
showed that the disease can be transmitted by the<lb/>
mosquito. To prove that the disease can not be ac-<lb/>
quired by contact with contaminated objects, more<lb/>
volunteers were exposed to the soiled clothing and<lb/>
bedding used by men who had died of yellow fever.<lb/>
Then followed a rigorous war upon mosquitoes. In<lb/>
seven months, Havana was free from yellow fever.</p>
<p>The lack of any method of national acknowledg-<lb/>
ment of the services of these experimentors of a<lb/>
quarter century ago, has emphasized the need of<lb/>
some official commission or other governmental ma-<lb/>
chinery for providing suitable recognition for the<lb/>
scientists, investigators, experimenters, and research<lb/>
workers, who are continually risking life and health<lb/>
as a part of their services to the public. In Europe,<lb/>
royal recognition has been the traditional method<lb/>
by which nations acknowledge such services, but the<lb/>
United States, like all republics, has no such con-<lb/>
venient method of granting unusual rewards.</p>
<p>Hence, in planning this measure, it was felt that<lb/>
the primary emphasis should be upon our public and<lb/>
official acknowledgment of the nation's sense of grati-<lb/>
tude to those who have through risks and sacrifices<lb/>
contributed notably to public welfare. Any refer-<lb/>
ence to pension or annuity features should be made in<lb/>
the form of expressing the nation's sense of obliga-<lb/>
tion, not in the sense of offering a compensation for<lb/>
services that can never be compensated. It should,<lb/>
however, undertake to protect its beneficiaries against<lb/>
suffering or privation.</p>
<p>The paramount concern at this time, however, is<lb/>
to provide for the survivors of the yellow fever ex-<lb/>
periments and for their dependents. These include<lb/>
Mrs. Walter Reed; Mrs. James Carroll; Mrs. Jesse<lb/>
W. Lazear; Dr. Aristides Agramonte; Pvt. John H.<lb/>
Andrus, Hospital Corps; Mr. John R. Bullard; Pvt.<lb/>
A. W. Covington, 23rd Battery, C. A. C.; Pvt. Levi<lb/>
E. Folk, Hospital Corps; Pvt. William H. Dean,<lb/>
Troop B, 7th Cavalry; Pvt. Wallace Forbes, Hos-<lb/>
pital Corps; Pvt. P. Hamann, 23rd Battery,<lb/>
C. A. C.; Pvt. James F. Hanberry, Hospital<lb/>
Corps; Mrs. Warren G. Jernegan; Pvt. John R.<lb/>
Kissinger; Mr. John J. Moran; Pvt. William Olson,<lb/>
Hospital Corps; Pvt. Charles G. Sonntag, Hospital<lb/>
Corps; Pvt. Clyde L. West, Hospital Corps; Dr.<lb/>
R. P. Cooke; Pvt. Thomas M. England, Hospital<lb/>
Corps; Pvt. James Hildebrand, Hospital Corps; Pvt.<lb/>
Edward Weatherwalks, Hospital Corps.</p>
<p>The Bill provides therefore for a pension of $250.<lb/>
a month hereafter for each of these cases, and then<lb/>
empowers the Smithsonian Institute to make recom-<lb/>
mendations to Congress covering each similar specific<lb/>
case in the future. The provisions of the law are<lb/>
broad enough so that any kind of award from a gold<lb/>
medal or a monument to a land or money grant, or<lb/>
a pension may be recommended.</p>
