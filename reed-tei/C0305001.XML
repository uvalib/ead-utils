<salute>Dear Dr Fricks</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thanks for you reference for the<lb/>
Russian malaria. I did not receive<lb/>
the original letter, 9,000,000 cases is the<lb/>
estimate as I recall- I read it a few days ago.<lb/>
I do not however see the details of which<lb/>
you spoke. (1) Of it being a Winter epi-<lb/>
demic &amp; (2) House breeding of Anopheles.<lb/>
<del>the</del><add>Where</add> <del> did you a</del> can I find <hi>that<lb/>
data</hi>.</p>
<p>I am feeling exceptionally well, except for<lb/>
the pain in my back &amp; leg <add>&amp; that is no wise unbearable</add> &amp; have been<lb/>
I think getting better since the middle of<lb/>
March, I, or rather Laura, have, (a has) secu-<lb/>
red quaters, <add>for us</add> across the street. where I<lb/>
can go up stair's in an <hi>elevator</hi> &amp; so<lb/>
after June 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>I will be able to get<lb/>
<hi>out of door's</hi>, which I have greatly missed<lb/>
&amp; which I think will be both pleasant &amp;<lb/>
good for me, since my arrival here Nov 15. I<lb/>
have been on this floor &amp; for 6 weeks previously<lb/>
<hi>in</hi> one room &amp; a porch- at Hopkins.</p>
<p>Still there is a good deal in life for me. David<lb/>
to the contrary-the last 2&frac12; year's have <hi>not</hi><lb/>
been &ldquo;labor and sorrow&rdquo;, I have done<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0305002"/>
2<lb/>
some, not a great deal naturally, of <del>use<lb/>
fu</del> work <add>some of which was useful</add> &amp; (except when in pain) not<lb/>
had a bad, (&amp; never an uninteresting)<lb/>
<hi>time</hi>.</p>
<p>I hope to finish in <del>May</del><add>June</add> or maybe in<lb/>
July the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> section of my &ldquo;His'y of Yel-<lb/>
low Fever.&rdquo; I am working on it regularly<lb/>
everyday <add>now</add>, as long as my physician will<lb/> 
let me be up- about 3 hours (&amp; 4 days a<lb/>
week when I don't have to take massage<lb/>
an hour. <del><unclear>I rise</unclear></del> extra which I usually<lb/>
make 1&frac12; hours).</p>
<p>I think that will be as far as I can go, as I<lb/>
will need more data &amp; would have to go<lb/>
to the Congressional Library for it. I can<lb/>
get books from the S.G. (Army) Li-<lb/>
brary but there are many I want<lb/>
which they have not &amp; only occasion-<lb/>
ally through Cumming or McCoy (who has<lb/>
been extremely nice to me) can I get one from<lb/>
the Congressional. <unclear><del>Well I can't do</del></unclear><lb/>
Well I could not have done much<lb/>
more work any how. I will be 72 - on Aug<lb/>
25<hi rend="superscript">th)</hi>. <hi>9</hi> 192, 2-10</p>
<p>The Congressional Library has been ex-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fC0305003"/>
3<lb/>
tremely nice to me. They had a<del>n</del> <add> manuscript</add> <del> M.SS.</del><lb/>
at the Vatican photostated for me!<lb/>
Said they &ldquo;had been intending to ask<lb/>
this for some year's &amp; this was as good<lb/>
a time as any&rdquo;, I have too a copy (photo-<lb/>
stat) also of Joa&atilde;o Ferreyra da Rosa's<lb/>
account of &ldquo;The Fever of Olinda&rdquo;. 
<del>Tra</del><lb/>
&ldquo;Trattado Unico da Constitici&otilde; Pestilen-<lb/>
&ccedil;ial &agrave; Pernambuco&rdquo;. It is not a very<lb/>
old book but rare. This was taken for me<lb/>
at the British museum (I found afterwards<lb/>
that I did not need it) <del>but is rare</del>. No copy<lb/>
<hi>printed</hi> (&amp; I suspect none other photostated)<lb/>
in the U.S. that the Librarian could hear of.<lb/>
Th<del>e</del><add>ere</add> are <hi>2</hi> in the <hi>Escurial</hi> &amp; I have no doubt<lb/>
others in Lisbon. It is <del>the first considered</del><lb/>
&ldquo;the first account of what <hi>may have been</hi><lb/>
Y.F. by a physician&rdquo;. Says B&eacute;ranger-Fer&aacute;ud<lb/>
It certainly <hi>was</hi> Y.F. as certainly as that we<lb/>
<hi>h</hi>ad in Peru.</p>
<p>I have had, I suspect, better facilities<lb/>
for this work than any other man has ever-<lb/>
had: I mean who has attempted it, &amp; I would<lb/>
have liked well to have finished it<lb/>
still if I can finish section III. &ldquo;The<lb/>
Place<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="fC0305004"/>
4<lb/>
Place of Origin of Yellow Fever&rdquo;. I<lb/>
am content, To advance knowledge<lb/>
by <hi>one </hi><add>complete</add> step, so comple<del>tely</del> &amp; certain<del>ly-</del><lb/>
that the next man may begin a step<lb/>
higher than the last man, is worth<lb/>
while, well worth while. I did that in the<lb/>
Epidemiology of Y. F. &amp; this, plus<lb/>
Ross' malaria work, directly - almost<lb/>
inevitably I think - led to Reed's Que<lb/>
mados experiments. <unclear>T</unclear></p>
<p>That was a big thing in - what it led another<lb/>
man to do: in the foundation it gave him.<lb/>
This - the Sect III - is comparatively trivial, but<lb/>
if I can <hi>settle</hi> the question, so that no<lb/>
one else will feel the need of further exam-<lb/>
ination, it will be a step added to our<lb/>
knowledge. Also, it <hi>may</hi> have a bearing<lb/>
on the sanitary work against Y.F. <hi>Where</hi><lb/>
it evolved, is where, if anywhere, we w'd<lb/>
expect to find other vectors besides aegypti<lb/>
&amp; even <hi>possibly</hi> animal resevoir hosts!<lb/>
There are neither in the Americas (asso-<lb/>
ciated with men in the topics)- but Africa<lb/>
has never been tested for them either<lb/>
experimentally or epidemiologically.</p>
