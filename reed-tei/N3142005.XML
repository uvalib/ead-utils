<p>THE MORAL EQUIVALENT.</p>
<p>Professor WILLIAM JAMES would find,<lb/>
in the service of men who offered their<lb/>
lives for the public good in exposing<lb/>
themselves to yellow fever infection in<lb/>
order to further its study and control, a<lb/>
full moral equivalent for that virtue<lb/>
which innumerable hosts have shown in<lb/>
war and which for ages has been ac-<lb/>
counted the prime virtue of manhood.<lb/>
There is now a resolution before Con-<lb/>
gress designed to give such recognition.<lb/>
Its preamble recalls the valorous spirit<lb/>
of Major WALTER REED and his associ-<lb/>
ates who in full knowledge of the danger<lb/>
involved and without hope of reward,<lb/>
except in the consciousness of the value<lb/>
of their contribution, faced this peril.<lb/>
It provides that in view of the high pub-<lb/>
lic service rendered, suffering endured<lb/>
and disabilities contracted by them in<lb/>
the interest of humanity and science,<lb/>
their names be placed upon the roll of<lb/>
the War Department with such grants<lb/>
to them during their natural lives and<lb/>
to their widows as Congress may deter-<lb/>
mine.</p>
<p>The resolution also looks toward<lb/>
prompt recognition of such other heroic<lb/>
equivalents in the future through the<lb/>
creation of a National Honors Commis-<lb/>
sion, consisting of <add>(</add>seven members repre-<lb/>
senting officially the Surgeon Generals of<lb/>
the Army and the Navy, the Public Health<lb/>
Service, the Bureau of Standards and<add>)</add><lb/>
<add>the Board of Regents of</add> the Smithsonian Institution <add>(</add>with Presi-<lb/>
dents of two of the Land Grant colleges<lb/>
or universities.<add>)</add> This commission is<lb/>
directed and empowered to investigate<lb/>
all cases of citizens employed in the pub-<lb/>
lic service of the United States who,<lb/>
through voluntary risk of life or health,<lb/>
shall have made conspicuous contribu-<lb/>
tion to the well-being and happiness of<lb/>
the people of this country and shall have<lb/>
endured disability or privation by reason<lb/>
thereof. It is to report to the President<lb/>
and to recommend suitable action in<lb/>
every case.</p>
<p>Surgeon General IRELAND has stated<lb/>
in a letter to Congressman WAINWRIGHT,<lb/>
who has introduced the resolution in the<lb/>
House, that he considers that the pen-<lb/>
sions when given were not &ldquo;suitable to<lb/>
meet the necessities of the recipients,&rdquo;<lb/>
or adequate to reward so great a work,<lb/>
and are even more inadequate at pres-<lb/>
ent. Funds have been privately raised<lb/>
to meet the necessities of one survivor<lb/>
and his family; but the service was given<lb/>
to the public through a Government<lb/>
agency and the Government should not<lb/>
leave the needs of such soldiers of peace<lb/>
to the chance care of charity or the<lb/>
recognition of their heroic service to the<lb/>
appraisal and reward of citizen commit-<lb/>
tees.</p>
