100 miles South<lb/>
of Hatteras, n. c.<lb/>

<hi>Installment No. 1</hi>-
<salute>My darling wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>You probably think<lb/>
that by this time that <hi>bad</hi> man<lb/>
who <hi>would</hi> go to Cuba when<lb/>
he needn't have gone, is good<lb/>
and <hi>sick</hi>, and my dear Room-<lb/>
fixer is possibly happy in the<lb/>
thought! But don't congratulate<lb/>
yourself too quickly, lovie, dear,<lb/>
for you might be mistaken-<lb/>
Here I sit at 8.30 a.m., this<lb/>
beautiful, balmy sabbath morn-<lb/>
ing, with my feet propped<lb/>
on the rail, while the good<lb/>
boat, Crook, plunges and rolls<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02128002"/>
as the necessity of wind and<lb/>
wave seems to require, and <hi>I</hi>,<lb/>
poor sailor that I am, am not<lb/>
feeling even a <hi>suspicion</hi> of<lb/>
sea-sickness! Bromide of<lb/>
sodium is doing its work,<lb/>
this time beyond a doubt; and<lb/>
you can depend upon it that<lb/>
I am not missing a dose!<lb/>
As we got out to sea from<lb/>
New York there was a heavy<lb/>
swell on, but our boat be-<lb/>
haved beautifully and she has<lb/>
continued to do so- Passing<lb/>
Hatteras at 8 o'clock, last<lb/>
evening, the sea was quieter<lb/>
than I had ever seen it at<lb/>
that treacherous part of the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02128003"/>
coast. This morning the<lb/>
sea is so beautiful -- not<lb/>
many white caps, but some-<lb/>
thing of a ground swell, which<lb/>
makes our boat roll a wee<lb/>
bit -- just enough to stir up<lb/>
the gizzards of land-lubbers.<lb/>
I see a few who are pale about<lb/>
the gills, and I so sympathize<lb/>
with them for I know, to my<lb/>
horror, what sensations<lb/>
they feel- There are about<lb/>
a dozen army ladies with<lb/>
their children returning to<lb/>
Matanzas and Columbia Barracks-<lb/>
A young contract Doctor, by<lb/>
the name of Cooke, a graduate<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02128004"/>
of the University of Va. is my<lb/>
state-room companion -- strange<lb/>
to say he goes to Columbia<lb/>
Barracks and will be my mess-<lb/>
mate there- He is a Virginian<lb/>
and a modest &amp; refined fellow.<lb/>
Major Godfrey and Cap't. Waterman<lb/>
of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Cav. and Cap't. Lewis of the<lb/>
2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Cav. are aboard- Their families<lb/>
all accompany them to Camp Co-<lb/>
lumbia. I wish that my Sweet<lb/>
oomsey &amp; baby-cocoon were<lb/>
going along with old Mr Farmer.<lb/>
Perhaps, you will change your<lb/>
mind yet, &amp; come down in Decr<lb/>
if only for two weeks- You could<lb/>
then have the pleasure of my com-<lb/>
pany on your return trip-</p>

<p><hi>Installment No. 2</hi></p>
<p>off the Georgia Coast,<lb/>
Monday Morning -- 10 a.m.<lb/>
October 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1900-</p>
<p>Well, as my dear oomsey has<lb/>
positively sworn, in her wrath,<lb/>
that she will only write to that<lb/>
<hi>bad</hi> man, every <hi>other week</hi> only,<lb/>
I think I will have to supply the<lb/>
letters from <hi>this</hi> end of the line!<lb/>
If you don't want to be both-<lb/>
ered with reading them, just<lb/>
turn them over to dear little<lb/>
cocoon &amp; let her decipher them-<lb/>
The day passed very quietly<lb/>
yesterday- The sea was just a<lb/>
little rough but not enough<lb/>
to counteract the effect of my<lb/>
good Sodium Bromide- Not<lb/>
one sail or smokestack came<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02128006"/>
in sight during the whole day-<lb/>
In other words, we had the whole<lb/>
broad Atlantic all to ourselves.<lb/>
The flying-fish doubtless thought<lb/>
that we were lonesome, so<lb/>
they came &amp; skimmed over the<lb/>
water alongside our good boat.<lb/>
I spent the morning in reading<lb/>
&amp; after lunch, I slept <hi>three</hi><lb/>
solid hours! During the eve-<lb/>
ning the beautiful little boy<lb/>
baby of Mrs. Lt. Harrison,<lb/>
on her way to join her hus-<lb/>
band at Matanzas, had a<lb/>
convulsions &amp; I aided the ship's<lb/>
doctor in administering to<lb/>
its wants- She reminds me<lb/>
very much of Mrs. Weaver<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02128007"/>
both in looks and pluck- The<lb/>
little boy, who is as fine a<lb/>
specimen as I ever saw, ex-<lb/>
cept our own, is better, this<lb/>
morning- Good weather still<lb/>
attends us and the captain<lb/>
says that the barometer in-<lb/>
dicates clear weather- We<lb/>
go first to Matanzas, about<lb/>
50 miles from Havana, and<lb/>
there unload a lot of hay &amp;<lb/>
oats for the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Cav., and then to<lb/>
Havana- We will not reach<lb/>
the latter harbor until the<lb/>
evening of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or morn-<lb/>
ing of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of October-<lb/>
I don't care as long as<lb/>
I am not sea-sick- I will<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02128008"/>
get a chance to mail this<lb/>
on Saturday at Havana- Now<lb/>
that we are further south, the<lb/>
air is much warmer at sea<lb/>
than it was on the evening when<lb/>
we pulled out of N.Y. Harbor-<lb/>
I have already left off my<lb/>
waistcoat and put on my white<lb/>
cap, whose cover the dearest<lb/>
room-fixer in the world, cleaned<lb/>
so nicely for me- Mr Bad<lb/>
man thanks Miss Room-fixer<lb/>
very much for her kind attention<lb/>
to his head-gear. We are having<lb/>
very good meals 3 times a day-<lb/>
I enjoyed, last evening, very much<lb/>
a potatoe-salad with sliced<lb/>
cucumbers- The sliced tomatoes,<lb/>
are also, delicious- Boo! Boo!</p>

<p><hi>Installment no. 3</hi></p>
<p>20 miles South of<lb/>
Miami, Fla,<lb/>
Tuesday morning,<lb/>
Oct. 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Don't<lb/>
read this<lb/>
lovie, if<lb/>
it makes<lb/>
your heart<lb/>
ache!</p>
<p>We are having a little more life<lb/>
to-day than we had yesterday-<lb/>
We have been coasting along<lb/>
the shore of Florida since mid-<lb/>
night, last night, and at 8 a.m.<lb/>
we were running along past<lb/>
Miami, Fla- Now we see the<lb/>
pretty Florida keys and to one<lb/>
who hasn't seen land <del>no</del> <add>for</add> 3<lb/>
days, the sight of the white<lb/>
sand and the green foliage<lb/>
is most welcome- We are<lb/>
running along about 1 mile from<lb/>
shore and the sea is almost<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02128010"/>
as smooth as glass. The little<lb/>
white cottages throw back the<lb/>
sun's rays so prettily, but not<lb/>
half so effectively as our dear<lb/>
little Keewaydin- I wonder<lb/>
if Johnnie Moore is hard at<lb/>
work, this morning, rolling<lb/>
together the big stones to put<lb/>
in the fence and to give room<lb/>
for those Albemarle pippins<lb/>
and early strawberry apples-<lb/>
I would give a dollar just<lb/>
to be present and look over<lb/>
that valley for 15 minutes.<lb/>
I also wonder whether the<lb/>
dear, sweet lady who fixes<lb/>
rooms so sweetly, has written<lb/>
me one <hi>line</hi> since I left!<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f02128011"/>
I guess not -- or if she has<lb/>
done so, it has been only<lb/>
from a sense of duty and<lb/>
much against her will-<lb/>
She doesn't have much use<lb/>
for <hi>bad</hi> men who run off<lb/>
to Cuba against her advice,<lb/>
but she <hi>can tolerate</hi> a<lb/>
man who makes a ter-<lb/>
raced garden with plenty<lb/>
of room for flower-beds!<lb/>
What a queer, queer world<lb/>
this is anyway! Isn't it so,<lb/>
sweet Room-fixer? But<lb/>
you <hi>must</hi> come down on<lb/>
this good boat &amp; see<lb/>
Cuba for 2 or 3 weeks<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f02128012"/>
before my return- <hi>Then</hi> you<lb/>
will feel more sympathy<lb/>
for poor old Mr Mantee!<lb/>
I wish your artistic eye<lb/>
&amp; dear little Cocoon's could<lb/>
catch the glint of green &amp;<lb/>
purple along the shore- You<lb/>
would be delighted with<lb/>
the effect- The Florida<lb/>
keys surely never looked<lb/>
prettier than they do, this<lb/>
October morning. We will<lb/>
be opposite key west, this<lb/>
evening, &amp; will enter Ma-<lb/>
tanzas Harbor tomorrow<lb/>
morning about the hour<lb/>
when precious Cocoon is<lb/>
on her way to school! Boo! Boo!</p>

<p>At anchor in<lb/>
Matanzas Harbor,<lb/>
Wednesday, 9 a.m.</p>
<p>When I awoke at 4.30 a.m., I went<lb/>
out on deck in my pajamas and<lb/>
found that our ship was at a<lb/>
stand still, while the waves gentle<lb/>
lapped her white sides- Through<lb/>
the pale light of morning I could<lb/>
catch the outline of the Cuban<lb/>
shore and the light of the flash-<lb/>
light that doubtless marked<lb/>
the entrance to Matanzas<lb/>
Harbor- I sat out in the<lb/>
deliciously cool morning<lb/>
air for a while, only clothed<lb/>
in my pajamas- After a<lb/>
while I turned in again,<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f02128014"/>
and when I was next awakened,<lb/>
the anchor chain was rattling<lb/>
at a loud rate- I then knew<lb/>
that we were in the Harbor<lb/>
of Matanzas- Pretty soon a<lb/>
number of officers came aboard<lb/>
to greet their wives and babies-<lb/>
I find that I have made a<lb/>
life-long friend of Mrs. Harrison,<lb/>
my attention to her little sick<lb/>
boy has quite won her heart-<lb/>
The ship's doctor, a fat, lub-<lb/>
berly contract, was so indif-<lb/>
ferent, that my heart was<lb/>
touched &amp; I did everything that<lb/>
I could to assist her- The<lb/>
little fellow, a beautiful boy,<lb/>
was alright &amp; smiling as<lb/>
he left the ship in his father's<lb/>
<pb n="15" id="f02128015"/>
arms- Both the Lt. &amp; his wife<lb/>
were very profuse in their<lb/>
thanks- Army people are the<lb/>
most grateful in the world-<lb/>
We now ride at anchor in<lb/>
a very pretty Harbor- Op-<lb/>
posite to us, is Hamilton<lb/>
Barracks, where all of the<lb/>
2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Cav. is stationed -- a beau-<lb/>
tiful location, amidst green<lb/>
hills- I shouldn't object to<lb/>
it as a station- Amongst the<lb/>
officers who came <add>aboard</add> <del>ashore</del><lb/>
I met Capt. Folz, our Dr<lb/>
Keefer's brother-in-law, with whom<lb/>
I messed &amp; campaigned in Mon-<lb/>
tana in 1891- He seemed very<lb/>
glad to meet me- I certainly<lb/>
<pb n="16" id="f02128016"/>
was glad to see him, as he<lb/>
was so kind &amp; courteous<lb/>
to me on that journey in Montana.<lb/>
The City of Matanzas lies beau-<lb/>
tifully on sloping hill-sides-<lb/>
Higher hills serve as a back<lb/>
-ground- It is said to be very<lb/>
clean &amp; has no Yellow Fever-<lb/>
I find that I could take a<lb/>
train at 3.15 P.M. &amp; reach Havan-<lb/>
a at 6 o'clock, to-day, -- I would<lb/>
like to go, as it only costs, <hi rend="superscript">#</hi>2.00<lb/>
&amp; I could save 24 hours; but<lb/>
as it would put me in the city<lb/>
after dark, when mosquitoes<lb/>
fly around &amp; bite, <del><unclear></unclear></del> <add>and</add> as<lb/>
I have promised dear Mrs.<lb/>
Room-fixer that I will take<lb/>
no chances, I won't take the trip-<lb/>
Am I not a good mantee! Boo! Boo!</p>
<pb n="17" id="f02128017"/>
<p><hi>5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Installment</hi>-</p>
<p>off the coast of Cuba,<lb/>
Near Matanzas, Thursday morning<lb/>
October 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 10 o'clock-</p>
<p>We rested at anchor in the Harbor of<lb/>
Matanzas all day, yesterday, while cargo was<lb/>
being discharged -- we left 2700 bales<lb/>
of hay and 2700 bags of oats for the<lb/>
2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Cav along -- besides 700 other pieces of cargo-<lb/>
Thunder-showers in the early afternoon<lb/>
tempered the air &amp; made it perfectly<lb/>
delicious- The night, with an almost<lb/>
cloudless sky &amp; a bright moon, was<lb/>
beautiful beyond description- I thought<lb/>
of dear Miss Room-fixer &amp; precious<lb/>
little Cocoon &amp; wished so much that they<lb/>
could see what Papa was seeing-<lb/>
At 8.30 a.m. we weighed anchor and sailed<lb/>
out of the beautiful Harbor, while the<lb/>
whole 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Cavalry was drilling on the<lb/>
shore at full view- Now we are<lb/>
<pb n="18" id="f02128018"/>
skimming over the blue waters at a dis-<lb/>
tance of half a mile<del>s</del> from the Cuban<lb/>
shore which can only be described as<lb/>
fascinatingly beautiful! Such shades<lb/>
of green &amp; such purple hills one sees<lb/>
nowhere else; at least I have never<lb/>
seen <del>it</del> <add>them</add>- My precious wifie <hi>must</hi> &amp; <hi>shall</hi><lb/>
come down before I return- Last eve-<lb/>
ning, Dr Kean, &amp; Dr Harvard &amp; Dr Stone<lb/>
of the Army came aboard to see me<lb/>
of course I was delighted to see them-<lb/>
Kean is the best fellow that ever lived<lb/>
&amp; says that I shan't expose myself in<lb/>
the least. No case of fever has oc-<lb/>
curred at Columbia Barracks. Mrs.<lb/>
Kean is coming down in about 3 weeks &amp;<lb/>
will live at Camp Columbia- I shall<lb/>
enjoy their society so much- We will<lb/>
reach Havana at one o'clock P.M. in good<lb/>
time to reach Columbia Barracks by 3 P.M.<lb/>
Dr Carroll is very much stronger, so Dr<lb/>
<pb n="19" id="f02128019"/>
Kean says &amp; will meet me with our<lb/>
private conveyance- I don't think that I<lb/>
will let him go back to the U.S. on leave.<lb/>
By remaining, we can complete our work<lb/>
here &amp; be back by Dec. 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, and then we<lb/>
can take up our teaching at Columbian<lb/>
College &amp; earn a part of our salaries.<lb/>
I must send off my orders for trees<lb/>
as soon as I get settled- Dr Roach<lb/>
wrote me a very nice letter just<lb/>
before I left Washington &amp; sent me<lb/>
the address of the party in Albemarle<lb/>
County who sells albermarle pippins-<lb/>
I must write to them also- Has dear<lb/>
little Cocoon begun her school? I hope<lb/>
so and I fondly expect so- I know that<lb/>
she and mother are enjoying themselves<lb/>
now that old Mr Mantee has gone &amp; left<lb/>
them to their own inclinations- What<lb/>
<pb n="20" id="f02128020"/>
a relief to dear Room-fixer it must be<lb/>
to get that horridly disagreeable <hi>man</hi><lb/>
away! I shall disappoint you, lovie,<lb/>
dear, by coming back and knocking all<lb/>
of your &ldquo;<hi>presentments</hi>&rdquo; sky-high! Dear<lb/>
me! I have written such a long letter<lb/>
that it will take sweet Cocoon half<lb/>
a day to decipher it- of course, I shan't<lb/>
expect that dear Room-fixer will <hi>bother</hi><lb/>
about reading it! I shouldn't advise<lb/>
her to strain her eyes! The rest of the<lb/>
page must be left for a word when<lb/>
we reach Havana- Boo! Boo!! --<lb/>
<hi>1.30 P.M.</hi> Here we are in Havana<lb/>
on a beautiful October afternoon-<lb/>
Am very well &amp; happy- Love &amp;<lb/>
Kisses to my precious children-<lb/>
Write when you <hi>feel like</hi> it!<lb/>
