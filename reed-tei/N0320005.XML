<p>================================================</p>
<p>MAPS ARE MADE<lb/>
MORE ACCURATE</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>Old System of Reproducing the World on a Flat<lb/>
Surface Caused Distortions in Distances--<lb/>
Improvement Is an Aid to Commerce</p>
<p>A NEW form of world map that<lb/>
overcomes the distortion in-<lb/>
herent in those maps hitherto<lb/>
commonly in use is being introduced<lb/>
<unclear>by</unclear> the Department of Commerce. It<lb/>
is called the &ldquo;Equal Area World<lb/>
Map,&rdquo; and has been prepared by the<lb/>
Bureau of Foreign and Domestic<lb/>
Commerce in cooperation with the<lb/>
Coast and Geodetic Survey.</p>
<p>The fault in the old maps was<lb/>
that when the curved surface of the<lb/>
earth was made to appear flat, dis-<lb/>
tances had to be altered to make the<lb/>
map appear continuous. The usual<lb/>
flat map, for example, makes the<lb/>
United States appear almost twice as<lb/>
large as Brazil, although Brazil is<lb/>
actually the larger. In approximate<lb/>
terms each of these countries em-<lb/>
braces an area similar to that of<lb/>
Europe. On some old maps Europe<lb/>
appears twice as large as the United<lb/>
States and about four times as large<lb/>
as Brazil. The same distortion ap-<lb/>
pears as to Africa, which looks<lb/>
smaller than North America, al-<lb/>
though 50 per cent. larger in actual<lb/>
square mileage.</p>
<p>The Mercator projection, with<lb/>
which maps have been made for<lb/>
more than 300 years, gives rise to<lb/>
the distortion. Apt illustration is<lb/>
afforded by attempting to spread out<lb/>
an orange peel on a flat surface. The<lb/>
peel must be torn and split in many<lb/>
places before it will lie flat, leaving<lb/>
ragged and irregular gaps. The same<lb/>
thing happens when the map-maker<lb/>
undertakes to &ldquo;flatten&rdquo; the globe to<lb/>
fit the Mercator projection. In the<lb/>
case of the map the gaps are filled<lb/>
with fictitious areas of land and<lb/>
water. The result is a condition of<lb/>
gross exaggeration progressively in-<lb/>
creasing toward the North and South<lb/>
Poles. The only point at which the<lb/>
map is true to scale is at the equa-<lb/>
tor. A square inch of the map in<lb/>
equatorial latitude represents several<lb/>
times as much actual territory as a<lb/>
square inch in Alaska or northern<lb/>
Europe.</p>
<p>To Aid in Commerce.</p>
<p>With the growth of American in-<lb/>
terest in world commerce and the<lb/>
closer contact between the United<lb/>
States and foreign nations, the<lb/>
United States Department of Com-<lb/>
merce has realized the disadvantage<lb/>
of using a map based on the old<lb/>
Mercator projection for the presenta-<lb/>
tion of trade and statistical facts.<lb/>
The new map presents every place,<lb/>
land or sea, in its correct geographic<lb/>
relationship as to area and distances<lb/>
in comparison with all other portions<lb/>
of the map. In brief terms it may<lb/>
be stated that each square inch on<lb/>
the new map stands for the same<lb/>
number of square miles as a similar<lb/>
space in any other region of the<lb/>
world.</p>
<p>The new map is said to be a dis-<lb/>
tinct innovation in chart making, af-<lb/>
fording marked contrast with the<lb/>
familiar maps based on the Mercator<lb/>
projection. In the Mercator type the<lb/>
parallels of latitude and meridians of<lb/>
longitude are at right angles. On<lb/>
the new map all the parallels run<lb/>
horizontally in line with the Equator<lb/>
and all east and west distances along<lb/>
parallels are true, permitting the<lb/>
comparison of all distances east and<lb/>
west. At no place does he obtain<lb/>
the distorted picture presented on<lb/>
the Mercator map.</p>
<p>For purposes of construction, and<lb/>
in order to offer the best possible<lb/>
shape, each continent on the new<lb/>
map has been centred on a mid-<lb/>
meridian vertical to the Equator.<lb/>
Along each of these meridians all dis-<lb/>
tances are true to scale, and may be<lb/>
given accurate measurement in ac-<lb/>
cordance with the linear scale given<lb/>
on the map. The greatest variations<lb/>
are where the meridians depart most<lb/>
from the vertical, but this occurs in<lb/>
remote ocean areas which are little<lb/>
traveled. For all practical purposes<lb/>
distances may be estimated with a<lb/>
fair degree of accuracy at all points<lb/>
on the map. This is impossible on<lb/>
the Mercator projection, since on it<lb/>
a scale can be used at no place but<lb/>
along the line of the Equator.</p>
<p>Continents in True Shapes.</p>
<p>The equal-area map is divided into<lb/>
three strange-looking lobes, as af-<lb/>
fording the best presentation of the<lb/>
land areas of the world. The<lb/>
&ldquo;blanks&rdquo; between lobes represent<lb/>
the large areas which the Mercator<lb/>
map-maker fills in with artificial<lb/>
territory. The innovation enables<lb/>
the new map to picture continents in<lb/>
their true shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the new map along-<lb/>
side the the accepted Mercator type<lb/>
affords interesting contrasts. On the<lb/>
older map North America appears to<lb/>
have far greater area than its sister<lb/>
continent on the south. The actual<lb/>
figures show that the area of North<lb/>
America is 8,049,000 square miles,<lb/>
while that of South America is<lb/>
<unclear>7,</unclear>018,000, a disparity much less than<lb/>
that indicated by the Mercator map.<lb/>
The new projection shows the two<lb/>
continents in true proportion.</p>
<p>Another pronounced exaggeration<lb/>
is manifest in connection with<lb/>
Greenland. On the Mercator map<lb/>
this territory appears larger than the<lb/>
whole South American Continent.<lb/>
On the new projection Greenland<lb/>
shrinks to proper proportions--<lb/>
about one-tenth the size of South<lb/>
America. The exaggeration of Mer-<lb/>
cator with reference to Greenland is<lb/>
due to the island's nearness to the<lb/>
Pole, where the &ldquo;gaps&rdquo; filled in by<lb/>
the chart maker reach their great-<lb/>
est extent. Alaska affords similar<lb/>
evidence of distortion when com-<lb/>
pared with Bolivia. The two are of<lb/>
about the same area, but on the<lb/>
Mercator projection Alaska appears<lb/>
several times larger.</p>
<p>The value of an equal-area world<lb/>
map for statistical and trade pur-<lb/>
poses is obvious. In planning a sales<lb/>
campaign abroad the American ex-<lb/>
porter is concerned with the relative<lb/>
extent of the areas involved in for-<lb/>
eign marketing. During conferences<lb/>
the trade executive equipped with a<lb/>
true map may easily estimate dis-<lb/>
tances between his sales centres, to-<lb/>
gether with the amount of territory<lb/>
each of his men will serve. A glance<lb/>
at the truly proportioned map shows<lb/>
him the futility of assigning one<lb/>
man a great extent of territory on<lb/>
the African coast, or the unneces-<lb/>
sary duplication involved in placing<lb/>
several men close together in thickly<lb/>
populated areas, where travel is a<lb/>
simple matter.</p>
<p>Distribution of Population.</p>
<p>The new map has especial value in<lb/>
connection with the distribution of<lb/>
the world's population. Because of<lb/>
the equal-area scale this map makes<lb/>
it possible to present a true picture<lb/>
of density throughout the world,<lb/>
since dots can be placed in their<lb/>
true locations with reference to one<lb/>
another. On the Mercator base such<lb/>
truthful presentation is out of the<lb/>
question, for the reason that most<lb/>
of the world's population is located<lb/>
at considerable distances north of<lb/>
the Equator, where exaggerations in<lb/>
area become pronounced. In conse-<lb/>
quence the Mercator base greatly<lb/>
understates the density of peopled<lb/>
areas.</p>
<p>Experienced exporters know that<lb/>
relative density of population is a<lb/>
vital factor in foreign distribution<lb/>
of merchandise. When the execu-<lb/>
tive sees trade facts properly set<lb/>
forth on a world map he learns much<lb/>
that is worth knowing. This is true<lb/>
of business data of all sorts. There<lb/>
is striking significance, for example,</p>
