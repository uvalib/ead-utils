Dr. Austin Smith, Editor<lb/>
Journal of the American Medical Association<lb/>
535 North Dearborn Street<lb/>
Chicago 10, Illinois<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Smith:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you very kindly for sending me the check for $15 to cover the cost<lb/>
of the wreath which was placed by Doctor Chrisman for the American Medical<lb/>
Association in honor of Doctors Finlay and Delgado.</p>
<p>I enclose a copy of a long personal letter which I have sent to the rela-<lb/>
tives of those who were honored; also certain newspaper clippings, some of<lb/>
which will show how well the Cubans carried on and one or two will show you<lb/>
the need for some continued missionary work to correct some persisting Cuban<lb/>
misconceptions.</p>
<p>Dr. and Mrs. Chrisman were very charming people and we were delighted to have<lb/>
them at the dedication. Two or three photographs were taken by press photo-<lb/>
graphers of Doctor Chrisman placing the wreath. I expect the films to be<lb/>
sent me shortly from Cuba.</p>
<p>I must stop momentarily my interest in this hobby and finish, within the next<lb/>
three weeks, an overdue chapter on cortisone. Not until then can I rewrite<lb/>
anything about the Camp Lazear dedication for you for the American Medical<lb/>
Association, perhaps toward the end of February. If you think I have given<lb/>
you enough information herewith that one of your writers could prepare what<lb/>
you want, please feel entirely free to do so and I should be glad to review<lb/>
your writer's manuscript briefly to note if there are any misinterpretations<lb/>
and I can send you representative photographs for you to choose from in the<lb/>
near future. Perhaps you would want two photographs - a large one of the<lb/>
dedication ceremony showing the memorial, etc., with a smaller insert of<lb/>
Doctor Chrisman laying the wreath. They might be fixed up and published as<lb/>
one photograph.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M.D.</signed>

P.S.: I know that Doctor Bauer, President of the American Medical Association,<lb/>
and General Lull were both involved in the decision to have the A.M.A. repre-<lb/>
sented at the dedication. If you think they would like copies of the enclosed<lb/>
letter I can send them each one or perhaps you could forward yours. On the<lb/>
other hand, both of them are so busy perhaps they would not be interested.<lb/>
