<p>* A paper read before the Ceylon Branch of the B. M. Association on the<lb/>
15th. April 1905.</p>
<p>Ancient Theories of Causation of Fever by Mosquitoes.*</p>
<p>By<lb/>
His Excellency Sir Henry A. Blake. G. C. M. G. Etc.<lb/>
Governor of Ceylon.</p>
<p>Reprinted from the Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the British Medical<lb/>
Association.</p>
<p>Vol 11. Part 1. 1905.</p>
<p>In the course of inquiries into the causation of an epidemic of<lb/>
malarial fever in Mutwal, a division of the town of Colombo, last year,<lb/>
I received a report from fifteen members of the Sinhalese Medical Asso-<lb/>
ciation, in which it was mentioned incidentally that according to ancient<lb/>
authorities on Ayurvedic medicine the chief causes of the disease are im-<lb/>
pure air and water and the existence of mosquitoes. I requested more pre-<lb/>
cise information showing that mosquitoes were associated with the causa-<lb/>
tion of malarial fever and in reply I received extracts from ancient In-<lb/>
dian works, among them an extract from Susruta, a Sanskrit work compiled,<lb/>
I am informed, from one of the lost Vedas. The age of the work is not<lb/>
known, but as it was referred to in the works of a contemporary of K&aacute;li-<lb/>
d&aacute;sa, the great Sanskrit poet who flourished in the sixth century of the<lb/>
Christian era, the work is at least 1,400 years old.</p>
<p>The following are the passages. They are taken from the Sanskrit<lb/>
edition published in 1873, and will be found at pages 43 and 45 (Kalpasthanam)<lb/>
:--(Eleven lines of Sanskrit follow)</p>
<p>Translation.</p>
<p>KITA.</p>
<p>Life-destroying terrific twelve<lb/>
kinds:--</p>

T&aacute;laka Sarshapika<lb/>
W&aacute;haka Avalguli<lb/>

<p>&ldquo;Their bite is as painful as that of serpents, and causes diseases<lb/>
resulting from the three humours joined together; the bite, as if burnt<lb/>
with caustic or fire, is red, yellow, white and pink colour, accompanied<lb/>
by fever, pain of limbs, hair standing on end, pain, vomiting, diarrhoea,<lb/>
thirst, heat, giddiness, yawning, shivering, hiccup, burning sensation,<lb/>
intense cold, vesicles or pustules increasing, swelling, knots under the<lb/>
skin, circles etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Two and a half lines Sanskrit)</p>
<p>Translation.</p>
<p>Masakah (Mosquitoes) are of five<lb/>
kinds:--</p>
<p>Samudra Krishna<lb/>
Parimandala P&aacute;rwatiya<lb/>
Hastimasaka</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their bite causes swelling on the part bitten, itching. As for the<lb/>
parwatiya, it has similar qualities to life-taking insects.&rdquo;</p>

Chief Sinhalese Translator to Government.</p>
<p>R. C. Kailasapillai, Mudaliyar,<lb/>
March 3, 1905. Chief Tamil Translator to Government.</p>
<p>That the translation should be verified satisfactorily I invited five<lb/>
Sanskrit scholars of acknowledged authority to meet at Queen's House. The<lb/>
translation is that unanimously adopted by these five gentlemen, who have<lb/>
signed the extract.</p>
<p>These passages, written possibly three thousand, and at least fourteen<lb/>
hundred years ago, are of singular interest, foreshadowing as they do the<lb/>
great discoveries of Manson and Ross.</p>
<p>Truly there is no new thing under the sun.</p>

<p>To the Editor of the News:-</p>
<p>Dr. H. A. Kelly, in a paper read before the<lb/>
Johns Hopkins Medical Society on May 8th, said that the ear-<lb/>
liest mention he has found of insects as carriers of disease<lb/>
comes from the Island of Ceylon where the Governor is said to<lb/>
have recently discovered in some native works, dating from the<lb/>
sixth century, the description of various kinds of mosquitos<lb/>
accused of causing malaria. This statement is not quite cor-<lb/>
rect. In the Babylonian Talmud, Tractat Chethuboth, page 77,<lb/>
is said that Rabbi Jochonon, who lived in the third century,<lb/>
warned people from the flies of certain diseased men. <del><unclear></unclear></del> In<lb/>
the Midroshic Literature, known by the name of &ldquo;Vayikro Rabbo&rdquo;<lb/>
paragraph 16, is also mentioned of flies carrying diseases.<lb/>
There can be no doubt in the originality and age of these Tal-<lb/>
mudic Works. I would like to know whether Dr. Kelly ignored these<lb/>
documents, or did not know them.</p>
