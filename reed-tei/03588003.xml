Dr. Donald B. Armstrong<lb/>
Third Vice-President<lb/>
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.<lb/>
New York City<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Armstrong:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I can't tell you how much I appreciate your bothering to send me the<lb/>
photographs of the Walter Reed episode, and also the movie strip. I shall make good use<lb/>
of these, I can assure you, and expect to have slides of some of them made, but will, of<lb/>
course, credit the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Could you give me the name of the man<lb/>
who had charge of the production of this movie strip? I hate to bother you by continuing<lb/>
this correspondence with you, but I am anxious to obtain the original source of the photo-<lb/>
graph of Walter Reed, &ldquo;Walter was an attractive boy&rdquo;, and the next photograph, &ldquo;At the age<lb/>
of seventeen&rdquo;. I know that the other photographs came from Kelly's book on Walter Reed.</p>
<p>I think you would like to know that in your book &ldquo;Health Heroes&rdquo;, as<lb/>
well as in the movie strip, there are a few historical errors. They are relatively unim-<lb/>
portant and I quite agree that when teaching the public, one should be permitted a little<lb/>
license. As a matter of fact, the experiment indicated on page 21 of your pamphlet,<lb/>
&ldquo;Health Heroes--Walter Reed&rdquo; was not quite carried out in that manner. Diagrams 1 and <unclear>2 3</unclear><lb/>
never actually took place. Diagram 2 did, of course, but Moran entered the one side of the<lb/>
Infected Mosquito Building first. No one else had used that side, and so far as the<lb/>
official record goes, no one used it thereafter. If your historian who made up this pam-<lb/>
phlet has other evidence, I shall be most interested to hear of it, but it most certainly<lb/>
isn't in the official record or the Senate Document.</p>
<p>Your artist's concept also of Camp Lazear is just that and nothing<lb/>
more. There is no river anywhere near Camp Lazear and your artist's concept shows the<lb/>
Infected Clothing Building and the Infected Mosquito Building separated by this river,<lb/>
with rather high mountains in the background. I have tramped over the site of Camp Lazear<lb/>
several times and I am familiar with the lay of the land. It is quite flat.</p>
<p>I realize that these remarks might be interpreted as criticism, and<lb/>
I pass them on to you merely in case your historians wish to be unnecessarily accurate.<lb/>
I realize that the films and pictures as they now stand quite serve their purpose. When<lb/>
I publish my detailed historical researches on this problem, I shall be glad indeed to<lb/>
send you a copy.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
