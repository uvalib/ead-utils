Miss Laura A. Carter,<lb/>
615 N. Wolfe St.,<lb/>
Baltimore, Md.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Miss Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>At last I have found a few negatives and prints of my<lb/>
collection of snap-shots of your father. As generally happens,<lb/>
many of the ones that I treasure the highest were not good prints,<lb/>
or if they were I have not been able to lay my hands on the neg-<lb/>
atives. However, I am taking some (Nos. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,<del>8,9,10,11</del>)<lb/>
out of my snap-shot album and would appreciate having these or<lb/>
copies of them returned to me if you are able to get copies made<lb/>
from the prints. Of course, I would not think of taking these out<lb/>
for anyone except yourself.</p>
<p><xref id="fP1240003">No. 1</xref> was taken at Parr Shoals, S. C., August, 1915. Of<lb/>
course, you recognize the gentlemen with Dr. Carter as &ldquo;Jim Hayne&rdquo;<lb/>
of South Carolina. <xref id="fP1240004">No. 2</xref> was taken on a Sunday afternoon, August,<lb/>
1915, at the Cheatham farmhouse, Steven's Creek, S. C. (above Augusta).<lb/>
Isn't this a characteristic pose? You will see in the background that<lb/>
I am keeping him busy drinking out of a watermelon while Le Prince<lb/>
snaps him. <xref id="fP1240011">No. 3</xref> I value very highly, as you can well imagine. This<lb/>
is another Steven's Creek 1915 picture. No. 4 was taken on the same<lb/>
date as No. 1, and the back is that of Dr. Hayne, who is telling a<lb/>
story. He hasn't quite reached the funny part but one is always warned<lb/>
by Hayne's story that the funny part is approaching. Hence the mirth<lb/>
of your father. <xref id="fP1240006">No. 5</xref>, another Steven's Creek, 1915 picture, shows the<lb/>
Doctor examining semi-aquatic vegetation. <xref id="fP1240007">No. 6</xref>, another Steven's Creek,<lb/>
1915 scene, a characteristic dipping pose. Dr. Carter had an infected<lb/>
finger at this time. You will note the dressing on it. <xref id="P01240012">No. 7</xref>, one of<lb/>
the war-time pictures, taken at Morrison, Va., near Newport News, on the<lb/>
drainage work for the protection of Camp Morrison, an aviation depot<lb/>
camp. This and <xref id="fP1240008">No. 8</xref> were taken at the same time (1918), the latter<lb/>
showing Dr. Carter testing the depth of a seepage ditch to see whether<lb/>
it had been dug <add>to</add> hardpan, a necessity in seepage ditch work. <xref id="fP1240013">No. 9</xref>, a<lb/>
group of Malaria field workers, mostly engineers, at the Wilmington 1919<lb/>
Conference (Feb. 17-20). Dr. Carter is discussing operation of various<lb/>
types of tide gates and in this case the gate is closed at high tide.<lb/>

I am sending you the negative from which the enclosed enlargement<lb/>
was made. This would stand considerably more enlargement is you<lb/>
want to make a larger copy. Do you recognize Louis Williams' back<lb/>
on top of the dike at the left? You may keep the enlargement.</p>
<p><xref id="fP1240010">No. 10</xref>, the whole group in attendance at the Wilmington Con-<lb/>
ference, with the exception of myself, whom you will recognize as<lb/>
a pretty good snap-shooter. I am sending you the negative and an<lb/>
enlargement of this scene. <xref id="fP1240014">No. 11</xref>, snap-shot of Dr. Carter at the<lb/>
Post Office in Wilmington at the same meeting. I would appreciate<lb/>
your returning all negatives and the originals of Nos. 1 to 7, in-<lb/>
clusive.</p>
<p>It may be that I will run across other prints or negatives,<lb/>
in which case I will certainly send them to you.</p>
<p>With kindest regards and best wishes,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
