Dr. Pedro Nogueira<lb/>
Marti 219, Marianao<lb/>
Habana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Pedro:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is curious that you and I should be thinking of each other and writing<lb/>
at the same time. Thank you very much indeed for your letter of January 3.<lb/>
I am delighted that Lambert was able to visit Camp Lazear. I am anxious<lb/>
to know of his reactions and yours to his visit.</p>
<p>How generous you are, Pedro, to sponsor my promotion to the rank of Comenda-<lb/>
dor of the Finlay Medal. I received the formal diploma yesterday. In-<lb/>
cidentally, does this entitle me to an even more impressive medal, such<lb/>
as one of those that hang around the neck? If so, I would like to have<lb/>
it and you can perhaps help me get one when I come to Havana in a couple<lb/>
of weeks. You know me - as pleased as a child with a medal. However per-<lb/>
haps I am still only entitled to the lapel medal. But I can assure you I<lb/>
am greatly pleased and honored.</p>
<p>I know very well, good friend, that you are mostly responsible, but please<lb/>
tell me if there is someone else that I should also write to so that I can<lb/>
express my thanks adequately.</p>
<p>I am delighted that you have included Doctor Carroll. That will complete<lb/>
the group and I agree with you that his family should get it even if his<lb/>
son failed to respond to your original letter. His son, George S. H. Carroll,<lb/>
died recently. I expect to be in Washington on February 18 and have<lb/>
made a date to visit Mrs. Carroll. I would be delighted indeed to take<lb/>
the decoration to her but perhaps it would be much better if you sent the<lb/>
decoration to the Cuban Embassy and had them present it to the widow. She<lb/>
and the family would like that much better. I don't believe Mr. and Mrs.<lb/>
George S. H. Carroll (son of Doctor James Carroll) had any children but<lb/>
George has a couple of sisters living. Mrs. George S. H. Carroll's ad-<lb/>
dress is: 2814 Rhode Island Avenue N.E., Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>I am sure that those who received the Finlay Medal last year, the Reeds,<lb/>
Lazears, Truby, etc., will be delighted indeed to receive them when you<lb/>
can arrange it.</p>
<p>It will be grand to see you in a couple of weeks.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
