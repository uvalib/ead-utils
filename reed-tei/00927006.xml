<p>Truby believes that Lazear probably did tell Carroll he was bitten by a mosquito at Las Animas, but that Reed and others felt Lazear had purposely allowed himself to be bitten.  He comments on Agramonte's role in the yellow fever work.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been too busy to answer<lb/>
your interesting letter before<lb/>
seeing to the many details<lb/>
requiring all of my time pending<lb/>
departure <unclear>tomorrow.</unclear></p>
<p>I am sure Carrol was correct<lb/>
in all of his statements and<lb/>
the one that Lazear told him (Carrol)<lb/>
that he had been bitten at Las Animas<lb/>
is also probably correct. However<lb/>
I have a distinct recollection<lb/>
that Major Reed and all of the<lb/>
other doctors at camp Columbia at<lb/>
that time felt that Lazear had<lb/>
been allowing his mosquitoes<lb/>
to bite him freely and that<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00927007"/>
2<lb/>
the chances were that he<lb/>
contracted yellow fever from<lb/>
one of those bites. I also have<lb/>
a feeling that Lazear when<lb/>
he was sick with yellow fever<lb/>
made the statement he did<lb/>
with a view to protecting<lb/>
his family in case there should<lb/>
be any trouble about his<lb/>
insurance. I think it was<lb/>
so interpreted by Major Reed-<lb/>
Lazear was very sick from<lb/>
the first and I think he had<lb/>
little hope of getting over the<lb/>
attack-</p>
<p>Agramonte's statements<lb/>
do not accord with my<lb/>
recollection of affairs and<lb/>
are not in accord with<lb/>
Carrol's statements- Agramonte<lb/>
was never an active worker<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00927008"/>
<hi>3</hi><lb/>
on the Board and had practically<lb/>
nothing to do with the work assigned<lb/>
to the other members by Major Reed-<lb/>
Carrol was wholly occupied with<lb/>
the study of the intestinal flora-<lb/>
Lazear was told to devote his<lb/>
time to the mosquito <unclear>theory.</unclear></p>
<p>Agramonte was to do post<lb/>
mortems and any pathological work<lb/>
that was required. He was not<lb/>
stationed at Camp Columbia with<lb/>
the other members of the Board,<lb/>
and came to Camp Columbia<lb/>
very infrequently- In my opinion<lb/>
he deserves credit as a member<lb/>
of the Board for the results<lb/>
accomplished by the Board, but<lb/>
I think he did little and<lb/>
deserves little credit for<lb/>
the actual work which resulted in<lb/>
<del>in the discovery of the</del>.<lb/>
proving Finlay's ideas that the<lb/>
disease was carried by mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Please pardon this hasty<lb/>
letter, I am just closing<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00927009"/>
my correspondence and<lb/>
everything as we are nearly<lb/>
ready to leave for San Francisco</p>
