<salute>My precious E.,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wrote you, on<lb/>
Monday last, a very short letter,<lb/>
but I hope to make some amends<lb/>
for it, this morning. I sometimes<lb/>
regret that I am not constituted<lb/>
like those, who are able to write<lb/>
a long &amp; interesting letter, by jot-<lb/>
ting down, each day, some item<lb/>
of news, and combining the whole<lb/>
into a pleasant narrative. Unlike<lb/>
these, I cannot draw on the stores<lb/>
of the Past, but must rely solely<lb/>
on the Present, &amp; when my task<lb/>
is once begun, must finish it, at<lb/>
&ldquo;one sitting,&rdquo; as they say -- In truth,<lb/>
if I expect to accomplish anything in<lb/>
writing ,I must always do it<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01633002"/>
under &ldquo;whip &amp; spur-&rdquo; This will<lb/>
account for the want of connection<lb/>
which often exist between various<lb/>
parts of my letters, but which is<lb/>
so necessary to give a charm &amp;<lb/>
vigor to the whole. No one could<lb/>
be more sensible of this defect<lb/>
than myself- What would I not<lb/>
give if I could only translate my<lb/>
thoughts into words which should<lb/>
drop from my pen &ldquo;like silver<lb/>
flowing&rdquo;- But alas! <add>as</add> I cannot ex-<lb/>
pect this, I will not enter into an<lb/>
uninteresting disquisition on<lb/>
Composition.</p>
<p>Your very sweet letter<lb/>
was received on Tuesday- You<lb/>
may know how happy I feel in<lb/>
receiving a letter from <hi>you</hi>, <hi>my<lb/>
little sweetheart,</hi> every week.<lb/>
Indeed, my darling, you are the<lb/>
very &ldquo;pink of promptness-&rdquo; I am<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01633003"/>
certain that when I reach<del>ed</del> my Post<lb/>
&amp; have a permanent habitation,<lb/>
that your dear little letters will<lb/>
arrive as regularly as the sun<lb/>
rises. And then how happy &amp;<lb/>
contented will they make me!<lb/>
To know that, though &ldquo;much land<lb/>
&amp; water&rdquo; separate us, yet that I<lb/>
am <del>yet</del> remembered by a sweet<lb/>
angel! And as I watch &ldquo;<hi>our</hi><lb/>
gem of the sky,&ldquo; how <hi>very near</hi><lb/>
to you I shall be! Shall anyone<lb/>
then talk to me of finding &ldquo;one that<lb/>
better pleases me&rdquo;? A &ldquo;<hi>fig</hi>&rdquo; for all<lb/>
resolutions thus easily broken!<lb/>
I know nothing of the either the<lb/>
lady or gentleman of whom you<lb/>
spoke in your letter, but I do know<lb/>
that he has <hi>never truly loved</hi><lb/>
her. I know you say, &ldquo;ah! but<lb/>
poor human nature is so frail<lb/>
&amp; changeable, &amp; we cannot tell what<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01633004"/>
a day may bring forth.&rdquo; Very true!<lb/>
The man or woman does not breathe<lb/>
who has less confidence in the<lb/>
steadfastness of the human heart,<lb/>
taken as a whole, than myself-<lb/>
But, &ldquo;Heaven of the Blest,&rdquo; is there<lb/>
naught of <hi>truth</hi> on earth! Is there<lb/>
no spark of <hi>manliness</hi> or <hi>honor</hi><lb/>
yet alive in the human breast!<lb/>
Is life but one interminable night<lb/>
of darkness! And do <hi>all</hi> of its<lb/>
fruits &ldquo;turn to ashes&rdquo; on our lips!<lb/>
Are <hi>all</hi> things <hi>false</hi>! Is there<lb/>
no rock upon which we may safe-<lb/>
ly stand! Ah! see that <hi>trembling<lb/>
lip</hi> &amp; that <hi>moistened eye</hi>; <hi>feel</hi><lb/>
the press of that <hi>warm hand</hi>,<lb/>
and tell me if there is not<lb/>
<hi>some truth</hi> yet on earth-! And<lb/>
are we <del>to</del> so soon to forget these<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01633005"/>
things! What kind of natures<lb/>
have we, if these sacred impres-<lb/>
sions are so quickly effaced!<lb/>
No! my darling, tell me not of re-<lb/>
leasing me, if another please me<lb/>
more! I know it shows a for-<lb/>
giving spirit- I believe that you<lb/>
would forego your own pleasure<lb/>
if you thought it would increase<lb/>
another's happiness -- but not-<lb/>
withstanding this, such words fall<lb/>
upon my heart like a cold show-<lb/>
er! And although it may show<lb/>
a spirit of selfishness, on my<lb/>
part, <hi>I would not be willing to<lb/>
give you up</hi> should you meet<lb/>
one who &ldquo;pleased you better&rdquo;-<lb/>
I <hi>never could give you</hi> up! (Save<lb/>
to the God who gave you being)-<lb/>
Give you up! <add>I</add> to be tossed on<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01633006"/>
life's tempestuous sea without an<lb/>
anchor!</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Give thee up!</l>
<l>What could my grief assuage,</l>
<l>Or what <del>prevent</del> <add>restrain</add></l>
<l>My heart from bursting through its cage!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Give thee up!</l>
<l>What joy were mine!</l>
<l>Where could I hope</l>
<l>One happy hour to find!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Give thee up!</l>
<l>What were my lot!</l>
<l>In cell to sup,</l>
<l>And press a hermit's cot!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Give thee up!</l>
<l>And <hi>I</hi>, a lifeless clod!</l>
<l>I'll <hi>never</hi> give thee up,</l>
<l>Save to thy God!!</l>
</lg>
<pb n="7" id="f01633007"/>
<p>These lines are but poor poe-<lb/>
try, but they have one recom-<lb/>
mendation &amp; that is, <hi>they come<lb/>
from the heart</hi>, &amp; coming from<lb/>
the heart, defy all criticism!</p>
<p>The hour for mailing my<lb/>
letter is nearly at hand &amp; I must<lb/>
hasten to the end of my letter-<lb/>
I wrote to your mother, yesterday,<lb/>
&amp; as you requested, I got Mrs V.<lb/>
to direct the letter -- also put it<lb/>
in one of her envelopes, so that<lb/>
no one can possibly suspect<lb/>
anything- Who are these people<lb/>
that tease you so much? I<lb/>
regret that I can't be present to<lb/>
share the teasing with you-<lb/>
About my coming to M. As I<lb/>
wrote you in my last, I am<lb/>
not certain that I can come-<lb/>
If I am ordered, at once, to<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01633008"/>
such a post, of course, I can-<lb/>
not possibly come without<lb/>
disobeying orders &amp; risking<lb/>
my position -- Rest assured of<lb/>
this one thing- If it is <hi>possible</hi><lb/>
for me to come to Murfreesbo-<lb/>
ro- I'll <hi>certainly</hi> come-<lb/>
The photographs will be ready<lb/>
to-day, but not in time to go<lb/>
in this letter- will forward<lb/>
it this afternoon, so that you<lb/>
will get it Monday- Ma received<lb/>
a letter from you, yesterday- She<lb/>
and Mrs. V. send much love-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, darling, as ever,<lb/>
Affectionately and<lb/>
devotedly yours,</salute>
