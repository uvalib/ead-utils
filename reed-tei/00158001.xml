<p>for you.</p>
<p>I left Strassburg on Monday<lb/>
morning and walked that day as<lb/>
far as B&uuml;hl about eight miles<lb/>
from Baden-Baden. In the morning<lb/>
I walked over the hills to Baden<lb/>
and met Norris there. He had<lb/>
come up by rail. We spent the<lb/>
rest of the morning there walking<lb/>
around and seeing the sights.<lb/>
It is a very beautiful place<lb/>
and beautifully situated.<lb/>
At noon Norris started for Heidel-<lb/>
berg by rail and I went off on<lb/>
foot taking in the old castle<lb/>
of Baden on the way. I reached<lb/>
Rostatt last night. It is a walled<lb/>
and fortified town full of<lb/>
soldiers. By the way; as I was<lb/>
leaving B&uuml;hl I saw seven companys<lb/>
of artillery on the march. One of<lb/>
them had stayed all night at B&uuml;hl<lb/>
the bugle woke me up at six o'clock.<lb/>
The Germans keep up an enormous<lb/>
army and they keep them in fine training.<lb/>
I dropped pedestrianism at Rostatt<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00158002"/>
for the time being and rode here<lb/>
by rail stopping for three hours<lb/>
at Karlsruhe. I did this because<lb/>
<del>the</del> the country there was not<lb/>
especially interesting and I<lb/>
thought it better to put the time<lb/>
I have on the best parts of the<lb/>
Rhine. I must stay here a day<lb/>
or two to get my linen washed<lb/>
and <del>then</del> my walking shoes<lb/>
resoled, and then, on again.</p>
<p>In speaking of Miss Pratt you<lb/>
talk as though I had been very<lb/>
attentive to her and that it was<lb/>
necessary to break the news<lb/>
gently that she seemed to like<lb/>
Harry Orr. The truth is I was never<lb/>
any more than decently polite<lb/>
to her and often not that and<lb/>
I never called on her but once<lb/>
in my life. She is an extremely<lb/>
agreable girl but I am not<lb/>
a subject for condolence this<lb/>
time.</p>
<p>Thursday Aug. 8.</p>
<p>I sat up until quite late last night<lb/>
reading the New York papers that you<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00158003"/>
sent me. I found four of them<lb/>
here and I have not finished them<lb/>
yet. I found a great deal that<lb/>
was interesting I still think that<lb/>
the New York Times is the best paper<lb/>
in the world. Nothing in London or<lb/>
Paris can come up to it.</p>
<p><del>Karl</del> Karlsruhe where I stopped yesterday<lb/>
is quite a pretty place. It is layed out<lb/>
wheel fashion like Washington. It<lb/>
is the capital of the Grand-duchy of<lb/>
Baden and has a palace and many<lb/>
government buildings and an art<lb/>
gallery.</p>
<p>I have not yet had time to see much<lb/>
of Heidelberg but it seems to be<lb/>
very interesting and it is beautifully<lb/>
situated.</p>
<p>I have only a week and two days<lb/>
before I sail. I have ordered my letters<lb/>
sent to Amsterdam. Altogether I<lb/>
think my vacation has been very<lb/>
profitable.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
