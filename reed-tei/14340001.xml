<salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of the<lb/>
29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> reached me yesterday,<lb/>
and I was so glad and so<lb/>
relieved to have such good<lb/>
news of George. Gertrude<lb/>
and I had been comparing<lb/>
notes <del>of</del><add>over</add> the telephone just<lb/>
that morning, but neither<lb/>
of us knew anything very<lb/>
satisfactory or definite, so<lb/>
I sent her word last night<lb/>
by Gertrude Shaw about<lb/>
your letter, and I am hop-<lb/>
ing she will drive out to<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14340002"/>
see me this afternoon. I<lb/>
do feel so sorry for you<lb/>
and Molly, for all the<lb/>
anxiety and trouble you<lb/>
have had, and I wish I<lb/>
had been nearer to help<lb/>
you both. I wonder if<lb/>
George will be strong e-<lb/>
nough to come down with<lb/>
Rannie. It would be<lb/>
such a help to Molly if<lb/>
they could come together.</p>
<p>Mama and I went in<lb/>
to town yesterday, with<lb/>
Capt. Slocum and Mrs.<lb/>
McAlpin to attend the<lb/>
memorial service for the<lb/>
Queen. It was held in<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14340003"/>
the Commandancia del Marina, on the<lb/>
Machina Wharf. It was very solemn and<lb/>
impressive when we went in for the<lb/>
house was all hung with black, and the<lb/>
military band was playing a dirge, but<lb/>
all the solemnity stopped with that. I<lb/>
was so disgusted with the service. It con-<lb/>
sisted of stupid addresses by four clergy-<lb/>
men, who had been warned to avoid<lb/>
all religion in their remarks, (!) and per-<lb/>
fectly interminable music, opera I am sure,<lb/>
very poorly sung by the troupe from<lb/>
the Tacon. All the consuls were there in<lb/>
their glittering uniforms, and Gen. Wood<lb/>
and his staff <add>in full dress.</add> made us very proud of<lb/>
our American men. But Mama, Mrs.<lb/>
McA. and I stood the service for about<lb/>
two hours, and then, as we were near<lb/>
the door, we basely fled and left Capt.<lb/>
Slocum, who was up in front with the<lb/>
staff. It was such a theatrical hollow<lb/>
performance, it did not seem possible<lb/>
that it was in memory of dear, old<lb/>
Queen Victoria. Why the British Consul did<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14340004"/>
not use his Prayer Book<lb/>
I cannot imagine.</p>
<p>This morning Mrs. Mc<lb/>
Alpin held a service in<lb/>
the pavilion. It was<lb/>
lovely, and her address<lb/>
was really beautiful.<lb/>
She had a service for the<lb/>
men only Thursday night,<lb/>
and there were four<lb/>
hundred present! When<lb/>
she is in Morristown<lb/>
again, Mumsie, do meet<lb/>
her, for she is perfectly<lb/>
charming. So throughly<lb/>
good, but so jolly and<lb/>
an awfully good companion.<lb/>
She has completely won<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14340005"/>
my heart. Gen. McAlpin<lb/>
is expected next week<lb/>
for a short visit. Capt.<lb/>
Slocum says he is equally<lb/>
charming, but quite a &ldquo;bird.&rdquo;<lb/>
He is distressed that<lb/>
Rannie is going to miss<lb/>
Gen. McA. <del>Of</del> Of<lb/>
course I have not had<lb/>
time to hear from Rannie<lb/>
yet, but I suppose he is<lb/>
in Washington, and goes<lb/>
up before the board to-<lb/>
morrow. You will probably<lb/>
hear from him before I<lb/>
do. I hope the poor fellow<lb/>
is not freezing to death<lb/>
in what May Myrick<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14340006"/>
used to call the &ldquo;cold and clammy north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your beloved Bobs is getting bigger and<lb/>
dearer every day. I don't see why the<lb/>
little rascal does not get some teeth.<lb/>
I wish he would, for I am getting quite<lb/>
thin again, altho' I feel perfectly well.</p>
<p>I suppose you have realized that<lb/>
Lawrence's regiment is ordered to<lb/>
the Phillipines. And Dr. Reed goes<lb/>
back to Washington next week. We will<lb/>
miss him very much. Dr. Ames, the<lb/>
&ldquo;immune&rdquo;, who took care of all the<lb/>
yellow fever cases last year, is just<lb/>
now recovering from an attack of yellow<lb/>
fever! Nobody seems to have any very<lb/>
definite opinion as to how he got it. I<lb/>
went over to Camp Lazear the other day<lb/>
and saw all the &ldquo;loaded&rdquo; mosquitoes.<lb/>
It was very interesting, but rather creepy.</p>
<p>Tell Peg Bobs cap was a great deal too<lb/>
small, but Mama made it big enough by<lb/>
useing the piece that was turned back.</p>
<p>Much love to all</p>
