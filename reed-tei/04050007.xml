<salute>My dear Doctor Hart:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am interested indeed to hear of your new position, with<lb/>
its increased possibilities. I am sure you must be enjoying it.</p>
<p>I am delighted that you have maintained your interest in<lb/>
the Yellow Fever story and the discovery of Camp Lazear. I, too, was<lb/>
concerned, lest the recent hurricane damaged the building, and I am<lb/>
writing to Mr. Moran to see what, if anything, has happened.</p>
<p>A curious meeting occurred last week in New York, where I<lb/>
was attending the convention of the Association of Military Surgeons.<lb/>
At a reception, I recognized a tall white haired figure as Doctor<lb/>
Ramos, until recently, Secretary of War of Cuba in the Batista Govern-<lb/>
ment. It was he with whom I had so many pleasant, but argumentative,<lb/>
discussions, before he would accept my findings. I have not seen him<lb/>
for four years; therefore, I did not expect him to recognize me. He<lb/>
was one of the distinguished guests and was talking to a couple of<lb/>
Admirals. I sneaked up quietly, touched him on the shoulder and said,<lb/>
&ldquo;Doctor Ramos, you may not remember me; I am Doctor Hench, whom .......&rdquo;<lb/>
He wheeled around and embraced me in Latin fashion, roared, and said,<lb/>
&ldquo;Doctor Hench, you think I don't remember you; how can I ever forget<lb/>
you? You have come to me from heaven; I was about to fly out to Hot<lb/>
Springs to see you. How wonderful to see you here!&rdquo; He had two or<lb/>
three most interesting propositions to make, and the result was that<lb/>
he and my wife and I dined together and spent the whole next morning<lb/>
going over his plans. He has indorsed completely my little plan for<lb/>
memorializing the little camp and building, and he wants the Cuban<lb/>
people and Government to participate. There is a lot more to it that<lb/>
I don't have time to go into at this moment. Needless to say, any con-<lb/>
sideration that you would care to give will be most appreciated at the<lb/>
appropriate time.</p>
<p>I will be very glad indeed to receive a half dozen<lb/>
copies of the article in Horizontes Medicos, and will be especially<lb/>
anxious to see your own article on the subject. If I can help you in<lb/>
anyway, please let me know.</p>
