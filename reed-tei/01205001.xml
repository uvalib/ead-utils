Dr. Muhlens' paper<lb/>
Argentina.<lb/>
<salute>Discussion: Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Some notes, to which I have already alluded, have been made during re-<lb/>
cent years by LePrince: Griffitts and myself on m<del>e</del><add>i</add>nor variations in the bio-<lb/>
logy of certain anopheles in different regions and Dr. Muhlens has here devel-<lb/>
oped a regional variation of a mosquito's relation to the malarial parasite<lb/>
which is most interesting. Darling found <hi>Anopheles pseudo-punctipennis</hi> quite<lb/>
difficult to infect with malaria in Panama. My recollection is, I am not positive<lb/>
of the proportion<del>,</del> however, that he found about seven times as many <hi>albimanus</hi><lb/>
showed infection as did <hi>pseudo-punctipennis</hi> under the same conditions of expos-<lb/>
ure. Herms, after a malaria and mosquito survey in California, regarded <hi>pseudo-<lb/>
punctipennis</hi> as of m<del>e</del><add>i</add>nor importance as a vector in nature in that State, and I<lb/>
think that opinion is held of it in such parts of the U. S. <del>as</del><add>in which</add> it occurs--I have<lb/>
not seen it east of the Mississippi River. Yet Dr. Muhlens reports it to be a<lb/>
very efficient vector of malaria in parts of Argentina: a thing worth noting<lb/>
and, taken with Darling's and Herm's observations, well worth noting.</p>
<p>As to the distribution of American Trypanosomiasis (Chagas Disease) I<lb/>
would say that I was shown the Tritoma, its vector, commonly known as &ldquo;<hi>o bar-<lb/>
biero</hi>&rdquo; (&ldquo;the barber&rdquo;) and was told of cases when I was at Fortaleza in the<lb/>
State of Ceara, almost the extreme north-eastern point of Brazil: <unclear>andthers</unclear> show-<lb/>
ing, by Dr. Muhlens, of its occurrence in the State of Tucuman in Argentina is<lb/>
close to (and beyond) the south-west end of Brazil. This infection then would<lb/>
seem to extend entirely across Brazil from the north-east to the south-west.<lb/>
I was also told by Dr. Chagas last year that it was found in the extreme north of<lb/>
Brazil close to the Venezuelan border.</p>
<p>This, as is well known to you, is one of the infections of man of which the<lb/>
causative organism has <del>a</del> resevoir host<add>s</add>--<del>or it may be, hosts</del>--like the African<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01205002"/>
African<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
trypanosome with some of the big game of that country and the spotted fever<lb/>
of the Rocky Mountains of the U. S. One, or possibly <hi>the</hi>, principal reservoir<lb/>
host for this trypanosome is the armadillo; which, it is claimed, carries the<lb/>
parasite and is infective to its insect vector indefinitely. The insect vector<lb/>
is nearly as large, although not as thick, as one's thumb--hence <del>does</del><add>would</add> not need<lb/>
a fine meshed screen to exclude it.</p>
