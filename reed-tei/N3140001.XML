<p>NEW HONOR FOR A HEROIC ARMY DOCTOR</p>
<p>Major Reed's Birthplace Is Made a National Monument<lb/>
In Recognition of His Conquest of Yellow Fever</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">By C. G. POORE</hi></p>
<p>It is dramatically fitting that in<lb/>
the year that the last traces of<lb/>
one of the great scourges of<lb/>
mankind are being driven from<lb/>
the face of the earth the birth-<lb/>
place of the man who gave that<lb/>
boon to mankind is to be made into<lb/>
a national memorial in his honor.</p>
<p>Wars that kill men are at worst<lb/>
merely periodic; the vaster conflict<lb/>
to save their lives goes on forever<lb/>
against foemen often unknown. De-<lb/>
cisive victories on the frontiers of<lb/>
medicine are more rare than on the<lb/>
field of battle. But when they are<lb/>
won they not only save thousands<lb/>
from suffering and death; they in-<lb/>
sure the millions yet unborn as<lb/>
well. During the heat of a Cuban<lb/>
Summer Dr. Walter Reed, a sur-<lb/>
geon major in the United States<lb/>
Army who had been detailed to<lb/>
study in Havana a disease that had<lb/>
baffled medical men for more than<lb/>
three centuries, won such a victory<lb/>
over the yellow fever scourge.</p>
<p>That was more than twenty-five<lb/>
years ago. It would be pleasant to<lb/>
record that at the time the nation<lb/>
honored him as it would a general<lb/>
victorious in battle, but that would<lb/>
hardly be accurate. He was mod-<lb/>
erately praised in the short time<lb/>
that he was yet to live and then<lb/>
he went on to whatever immortal-<lb/>
ity this world gives its doctors. To-<lb/>
day his name is largely associated<lb/>
in the public mind with the vet-<lb/>
erans' hospital at Washington that<lb/>
bears his name. Books have been<lb/>
devoted to his achievement, ac-<lb/>
knowledgments appear in works of<lb/>
reference. But the details of that<lb/>
epochal accomplishment in Havana<lb/>
which has made possible the eradi-<lb/>
cation of yellow fever in tropical<lb/>
countries, where thousands of peo-<lb/>
ple died from the disease every<lb/>
year, are a trifle misty in the gen-<lb/>
eral recollection. So many more<lb/>
spectacular heroes have had their<lb/>
brief hours since then.</p>
<p>THE little house where Reed lived<lb/>
at Belroi, in Gloucester County,<lb/>
Va., will make a peculiarly ap-<lb/>
propriate national memorial to him.<lb/>
A structure that is little more than a<lb/>
cabin, wholly unpretentious, stands<lb/>
not far from the Tidewater Trail<lb/>
between Washington and Norfolk.<lb/>
It was originally built for the over-<lb/>
seer of a plantation. There, the<lb/>
pilgrim coming to honor a great<lb/>
man and the casual tourist passing<lb/>
will be told Walter Reed, the son<lb/>
of a Methodist country minister,<lb/>
was born in 1851.</p>
<p>It was in the blazing June of <lb/>
1900 that the curtain went up on<lb/>
the main drama of Walter Reed's<lb/>
life. Already a brilliant bacteriolo-<lb/>
gist. Curator of the Army Museum<lb/>
and its laboratory in Washington,<lb/>
he had two years before been as-<lb/>
signed to study the causes of the<lb/>
typhoid fever outbreaks among<lb/>
troops collected for the Spanish-<lb/>
American War and now he was or-<lb/>
dered to the commission in Havana<lb/>
that was investigating yellow fever,<lb/>
the plague of the southern hemi-<lb/>
sphere.</p>
<p>Early practice when a lieutenant<lb/>
assistant surgeon on duty at<lb/>
isolated garrisons in the Far West,<lb/>
where settlers came to the post<lb/>
with all the fundamental human<lb/>
ills, had taught him to face any<lb/>
emergency. Technical preparation<lb/>
at the University of Virginia and<lb/>
at Bellevue Hospital Medical Col-<lb/>
lege in New York had been supple-<lb/>
mented by work in the laboratories<lb/>
at Johns Hopkins in the great day<lb/>
of Professor William Welch. That<lb/>
work had stamped him as a master<lb/>
in medical research. Here was a<lb/>
St. George worthy to kill the great<lb/>
yellow dragon--if it could be killed.</p>
<p>The record of history was against<lb/>
him. The first lair of the dragon<lb/>
had been placed in Mexico among<lb/>
the Aztecs, and it had been placed<lb/>
in Africa among the negroes who<lb/>
were brought over as slaves of the<lb/>
Spaniards who swarmed after Cor-<lb/>
tez. Whatever its origin, &ldquo;yellow<lb/>
jack&rdquo; had killed both in vast num-<lb/>
bers and remained to prey the<lb/>
length and breadth of the New<lb/>
World, destroying one of Napo-<lb/>
leon's expeditionary forces to Haiti<lb/>
in 1800, wiping out a village here<lb/>
and a boat's crew there.</p>
<p>Traveling northward, it had killed<lb/>
about 100,000 Americans before the<lb/>
Republic was fairly established,<lb/>
reaching as far north as New York,<lb/>
where people fled in panic. The<lb/>
dragon had stretched its yellow<lb/>
coils across the Isthmus of Panama<lb/>
when the French were trying to<lb/>
dig a canal there, and those who</p>
<p><figure entity="n3140001"></figure> Major Walter Reed.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">From a Painting by N. M. Miller, in the Walter Reed Hospital, Washington</hi>.</p>
<p>lived sailed home. Now it was at-<lb/>
tacking American soldiers who<lb/>
were setting up the Cuban repub-<lb/>
lic. One-third of General Wood's<lb/>
own staff had died. More insoluble<lb/>
than ever, the ghastly riddle of the<lb/>
fever defied the world.</p>
<p>Then Major Reed took a hand.<lb/>
He had been in pest holes before,<lb/>
he had grown up during the Civil<lb/>
War, and neither war nor pestilence<lb/>
could dismay him. He walked<lb/>
through the sepulchral halls where<lb/>
young soldiers who had come<lb/>
through battles were dying help-<lb/>
lessly of fever, and he investigated<lb/>
the sanitary state of the old Span-<lb/>
ish town. General Gorgas, who was<lb/>
to achieve his own fame in Pan-<lb/>
ama, was there, too. He was scrub-<lb/>
bing the accumulated filth of cen-<lb/>
turies from Havana, but that had<lb/>
not reduced yellow fever. All the<lb/>
usual experiments were made by<lb/>
the commission, just as they had<lb/>
been made year after year by ear-<lb/>
nest physicians who published large,<lb/>
elaborately documented reports that,<lb/>
however, did not indicate causes.<lb/>
The yellow dragon went on his<lb/>
lethal way. Presently two contribu-<lb/>
tions to the inquiry began to inter-<lb/>
est Major Reed. One came from<lb/>
Mississippi, the other originated<lb/>
there in Cuba. Another army sur-<lb/>
geon. Henry R. Carter, had dis-<lb/>
covered that, in the case of an in-<lb/>
fected house, people who went there<lb/>
immediately after some one had<lb/>
had yellow fever in it did not catch<lb/>
the disease. The other theory was<lb/>
put forth by Dr. Carlos J. Finlay of<lb/>
Havana. Dr. Finlay's friends had<lb/>
taken him seriously on practically<lb/>
everything until he began to dis-<lb/>
cuss his &ldquo;hallucination&rdquo; about mos-<lb/>
quitos carrying yellow fever. Though<lb/>
he had tried for years, he had never<lb/>
been able to show a case. He merely<lb/>
thought mosquitos carried it.</p>
<p>Major Reed's experiments now<lb/>
took a new direction. He was going<lb/>
to leave no stone unturned, and he<lb/>
was going to give the theories of<lb/>
these two men a thorough trial. It<lb/>
was destined to be more thorough<lb/>
than any one expected when it be-<lb/>
gan; it was to lead to experiment<lb/>
with human beings, a thing un-<lb/>
dreamed of, before the genius of<lb/>
the quiet Virginian had arrived at<lb/>
ultimate conclusions--and triumph.<lb/>
First Finlay's mosquitos, which he<lb/>
coddled as household pets, were to<lb/>
be allowed to bite men sick unto<lb/>
death with yellow fever, and then<lb/>
they were to be transferred to the<lb/>
arms of healthy men. Who were<lb/>
those men to be?</p>
<p>Major Reed, intent upon science,<lb/>
wanted very much to be one. But<lb/>
the rest of the investigating com-<lb/>
mission would not allow that, be-<lb/>
cause if he should die the investi-<lb/>
gation would end. Then Reed was<lb/>
ordered to Washington on official<lb/>
business. And while he was away<lb/>
Dr. Jesse Lazear, another member<lb/>
of the commission, one day took a<lb/>
mosquito that had been in a fever<lb/>
ward and allowed it to bite him.<lb/>
The human experiment was on.<lb/>
But nothing happened. What was<lb/>
wrong? Experimenters had failed<lb/>
to take into account the fact that<lb/>
Dr. Carter had contributed: it takes<lb/>
about a week or ten days the pe-<lb/>
riod of mosquito incubation after<lb/>
the infection--for the mosquito to<lb/>
become a carrier of the disease.</p>
<p>Then the fates dealt a double<lb/>
blow. For Dr. Carroll, of the com-<lb/>
mission, who risked the chance of<lb/>
death by making himself the sub-<lb/>
ject of the next experiment, caught<lb/>
the disease, and while he was lying<lb/>
at death's door Dr. Lazear, who had<lb/>
once survived the ordeal, was bit-<lb/>
ten accidentally by a free mosquito<lb/>
flying about the room and died.<lb/>
But no one could prove the mos-<lb/>
quito was infected. A few days<lb/>
later Major Reed returned from<lb/>
Washington.</p>
<p>Now the supreme decision must<lb/>
be made. One man had died gal-<lb/>
lantly in pursuit of a theory that<lb/>
was far from having been tested.<lb/>
Should the experiments continue,<lb/>
with such risks in the balance?<lb/>
Reed looked at the rows of dying<lb/>
men who were following thousands<lb/>
of others into the shades because<lb/>
there was no way of halting the<lb/>
invasion of &ldquo;yellow jack.&rdquo; The ex-<lb/>
periments went on.</p>
<p>REED now announced that vol-<lb/>
unteers were wanted. Pri-<lb/>
vate John R. Kissinger and a<lb/>
civilian clerk. John J. Moran, both<lb/>
from Ohio, came forward. Dr.<lb/>
Reed candidly explained the risk<lb/>
they ran--certain disease, almost<lb/>
certain death, for 85 out of 100<lb/>
were dying--and that the most they<lb/>
could hope for was a small Govern-<lb/>
ment pension for reward. At that<lb/>
they made their one stipulation--<lb/>
that they should receive no reward<lb/>
at all. Reed rose from his chair.<lb/>
&ldquo;Gentlemen, I salute you!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>So a small camp of death was es-<lb/>
tablished, and named for Lazear.<lb/>
There the two men, who were to<lb/>
spend most of the rest of their days<lb/>
forgotten, endured the stings of<lb/>
mosquitos that had bitten others in<lb/>
the last stages of a dreaded malady.<lb/>
Three days after he had been bit-<lb/>
ten, Kissinger became violently ill.<lb/>
The experiment was a success. And<lb/>
he lived to tell the tale. Broken in<lb/>
body, he is still alive on a farm<lb/>
that grateful people gave him twen-<lb/>
ty-seven years later. Moran allowed<lb/>
himself to be bitten, and lived.</p>
<p>Victory was in sight--but it could<lb/>
not be proclaimed until every possi-<lb/>
bility had been tested. That meant<lb/>
that the old theories of contagion<lb/>
and contamination must also be<lb/>
thoroughly tried. So through the<lb/>
horrors of long nights volunteers<lb/>
lay in the blankets and clothing of<lb/>
other men who had died of yellow<lb/>
fever, specially brought to Camp<lb/>
Lazear for them while Reed, bear-<lb/>
ing full responsibility, sleepless and<lb/>
torn with anxiety, watched the ex-<lb/>
periments. And because the win-<lb/>
dows were screened the volunteers<lb/>
did not fall prey to the yellow<lb/>
dragon whose emissary of death<lb/>
was at last proved to be the<lb/>
Stegomyia mosquito.</p>
<p>One of the great lasting conquests<lb/>
in medicine had been achieved.<lb/>
Walter Reed had found the way to<lb/>
save the lives of millions of people.<lb/>
He had triumphed over an enemy<lb/>
centuries old. He had made it<lb/>
possible for white men to go into<lb/>
parts of the tropics where they<lb/>
could not have lived before, and ac-<lb/>
complish the work of civilization.<lb/>
Had his discovery been made sooner<lb/>
France might have accomplished<lb/>
the building of the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>Now the great work of making<lb/>
the tropics healthful began there in<lb/>
Havana, when Gorgas, under Reed's<lb/>
directions, began to destroy the<lb/>
breeding places of the Stegomyia.<lb/>
He was to carry on that work in<lb/>
Panama with shining success, and<lb/>
others have carried it to the ends<lb/>
of the earth.</p>
<p>After Gorgas had cleaned up the<lb/>
Canal Zone and enabled the Ameri-<lb/>
can canal builders to work without<lb/>
fear of fever, the task of eliminat-<lb/>
ing the scourge from &lsquo;Central and<lb/>
South America was taken up. Cities<lb/>

<p>and ports that had been pest-holes<lb/>
for centuries were soon freed of the<lb/>
scourge and in our country New<lb/>
Orleans was able to write the end<lb/>
of an ugly chapter in her history.<lb/>
Today yellow fever is making its<lb/>
last stand in Africa.</p>
<p>Stegomyia, with her beautifully<lb/>
marked wings, is still carrying the<lb/>
disease in certain parts of the Gold<lb/>
Coast, and at Lagos, in Nigeria, the<lb/>
Rockefeller Foundation has estab-<lb/>
lished a fever-fighting field station.<lb/>
Set high above the ground on con-<lb/>
crete pillars are the buildings where<lb/>
the American scientists live. There<lb/>
is an office, a laboratory, two dor-<lb/>
mitories and a staff house. And it<lb/>
is there, in the heart of darkness,<lb/>
that the final chapter is being writ-<lb/>
ten for the great book of progress<lb/>
in the preservation of human life<lb/>
that Walter Reed began in Cuba.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, when Sur-<lb/>
geon Major Reed returned to the<lb/>
United States and Harvard and<lb/>
Michigan bestowed honorary de-<lb/>
grees upon him, it was said that<lb/>
his experiments would always &ldquo;re-<lb/>
main as models in the annals of<lb/>
scientific research, both for the ex-<lb/>
actness with which they were<lb/>
adapted to the points to be proved<lb/>
and the precautions taken that no<lb/>
experiment should be vitiated by<lb/>
failure to exclude all possible<lb/>
sources of error.&rdquo; That is perhaps<lb/>
the epitaph that he himself would<lb/>
have liked best, the judgment that<lb/>
his peers in the austere roll of sci-<lb/>
entists would pass, coupled with<lb/>
the words that President Eliot<lb/>
spoke when he gave him his de-<lb/>
gree: &ldquo;He gave to man control<lb/>
over that dreadful plague, yellow<lb/>
fever&rdquo;--the inscription over his<lb/>
tomb in Arlington.</p>
<p>Reed died of appendicitis in<lb/>
Washington in 1902. Suitable ma-<lb/>
terial memorials are slow in com-<lb/>
ing to him, as they have been to<lb/>
many others among the great. But<lb/>
few can have such a memorial as a<lb/>
universe freed from a scourge. His<lb/>
last words, as he lay dying at the<lb/>
moment when the world was be-<lb/>
ginning to receive the first bene-<lb/>
fits of his lasting achievement,<lb/>
were as characteristic as any he<lb/>
ever uttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave so little,&rdquo; he said. So<lb/>
little!</p>
