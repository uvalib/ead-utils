<salute>Dear Dr Hench-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was delighted to get such<lb/>
a nice long account of your European<lb/>
trip and also the grand, overwhelming<lb/>
news about your work in that most<lb/>
terrible of all crippling diseases. I can<lb/>
hardly wait for that <hi>preliminary report</hi><lb/>
and these which bid fair to follow<lb/>
as in the case of Y.F. I would say <del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del><lb/>
that if you can arrest those cases and<lb/>
prevent suffering &amp; deformity, that the<lb/>
Y.F. discovery in Cuba would prove to be<lb/>
of less value to the great masses of people.<lb/>
Anyway you could say with Reed &ldquo;The prayer<lb/>
that has been mine, for 20 years, that<lb/>
I might be permitted to do something to<lb/>
relieve human suffering has been granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Kean will be thrilled and<lb/>
he will probably appraise your work<lb/>
in more glowing terms than I can.<lb/>
You may be sure no leak about your<lb/>
work will come from here.</p>

Tr</p>
<p>I am glad to know that Moran has finished<lb/>
his manuscript and I will be pleased<lb/>
to see it if he is willing. I hope he<lb/>
is in better health than he was a year ago.</p>
<p>I am inclosing a clipping from the<lb/>
A. &amp; N. Journal of Feb 5. 49. showing that<lb/>
Senator Lucas, Democrat from Ill., has<lb/>
introduced a bill to place Gustaf E. Lambert<lb/>
on the <hi>Roll of Honor</hi> with Walter Reed<lb/>
and his guiney pigs. Please get busy with<lb/>
the S.G., Kean, &amp; Siler to see that the<lb/>
usual steps are taken by the S.G. to block<lb/>
that effort of Lambert's <add>which takes place</add> at each new session<lb/>
of Congress. The files in the S.G.O. will show<lb/>
everything that has been done before to<lb/>
block passage of that bill.</p>
<p>I am glad that you told me about Mrs<lb/>
Jernigan. I think she is most persistent<lb/>
too, in her own way, about claiming all<lb/>
sorts of help. In my book of letters recd, about<lb/>
my Y.F. story there is a letter from Dr Hugh H.<lb/>
Front <del>of</del>, Surgeon of the <hi>Jefferson</hi> Hospital,<lb/>
Roanoke Va<hi rend="subscript">x</hi> after telling me how much<lb/>
he enjoyed my book he had this to say:-<lb/>
&ldquo;We have had Mrs. Jernigan &amp; her son in<lb/>
the Hospital on numerous occasions as<lb/>
patients. In fact young Jernigan left the<lb/>
hospital recently. I am afraid this family<lb/>

3<lb/>
<del>ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
145 LAUREL STREET<lb/>
SAN FRANCISCO 18. CALIFORNIA</del><lb/>
has an idea that the United States has to<lb/>
support them&rdquo; Dr. Trout is a Fellow<lb/>
of the American College of Surgeons and a graduate<lb/>
of the Univ of Va.</p>
<p>There is one thing Mrs. Jernigan might do<lb/>
<add>for you &amp; me</add> and that is <hi>identity her husband's picture</hi> in<lb/>
that group with Reed by the Ambulance, under<lb/>
the tree at Camp Lazear. You have in your<lb/>
files my various comments on that <hi>very important</hi><lb/>
photo. I think that Jernegan is the man sitting<lb/>
on the bench with his right shoulder against<lb/>
the tree. He is between Dr. Cooke &amp; Kissinger.</p>
<p>If you have occasion to write to Mrs. J. again<lb/>
you might ask him if she has read what<lb/>
I <del>say</del><add>wrote</add> about Jernigan in my book on pp. 148,<lb/>
150 &amp; 173. No doubt she has seen it, but<lb/>
she has never written to me. I thought J.<lb/>
was the bravest of all the volunteers, for after the<lb/>
infected bedding test he let mosquitoes have<lb/>
a go at him and then <hi>late in the experiments</hi>, took<lb/>
the blood test which gave him Y. F.</p>
<p>I expect Lambert told Mrs. J about you.<lb/>
He is chronically active on the Y.F. subject<lb/>
and when we were in Washington last year<lb/>
Hanberry told me that Lambert complained to him<lb/>
because he was not invited to the 
Walter Reed<lb/>
celebration which we all attended in May. I have<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06501011"/>
AC<lb/>
Tr<lb/>
never been able to find any of Lambert's<lb/>
letters which I had in my filing case. I<lb/>
can't imagine where they are, but they may<lb/>
turn up <hi>some</hi> day. However, I quoted all<lb/>
of his statements that I believed, and the rest<lb/>
were of no value, (in my opinion). I think<lb/>
you must feel about Lambert very much as<lb/>
Kean &amp; I do. However, Ames trained Lambert<lb/>
and was devoted to him and trusted him more<lb/>
than he did Mrs. Lena Warner. I barely know<lb/>
her.</p>
<p>In the October 1948 number of the Military<lb/>
Surgeon, <add>you will find an item &amp; photo.</add> of the Walter Reed exercises in Washington<lb/>
last May. See pp 323 - 324. I think that Dr. Sawyer<lb/>
should really have seen to it that proper<lb/>
publicity in the papers &amp; magazines was given<lb/>
to that inmpressive program including your<lb/>
splendid illustrated lecture. Perhaps I have<lb/>
missed some reports of the event but I feel that<lb/>
it was very poorly covered even in the Military Surgeon.</p>
<p>I shall keep on hoping that your activities<lb/>
will soon bring you to S.F. again. All<lb/>
of the Trubys want to see you &amp; Mrs Hench and<lb/>
hear all about Europe.</p>
<p>I will do as you say &ldquo;Keep your fingers<lb/>
crossed &amp; say prayers for me&rdquo; in your<lb/>
promising work. I await
that preliminary<lb/>
report with great interest and hope it may<lb/>
<add>prove to</add> be the second one of its kind given me by<lb/>
my <add>two</add> good friends who really did big things for<lb/>
humanity. I have been a great &amp; enthuastic<lb/>
onlooker only, but that is something too.</p>
