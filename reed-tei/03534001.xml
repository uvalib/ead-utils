Mr. J. Howard Pew,<lb/>
President, Sun Oil Company,<lb/>
Philadelphia, Pa.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Pew:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am taking the liberty of writing to you to seek your good<lb/>
offices in a matter of great importance to this College. On October<lb/>
--- WASHINGTON &amp; JEFFERSON will inaugurate &ldquo;THE LAZEAR HALL OF CHEMISTRY&rdquo;<lb/>
which will be dedicated to the memory of Doctor Jesse W. Lazear, one of<lb/>
the <del>most</del> distinguished alumni of this college. Dr. Lazear as a member<lb/>
of the Yellow Fever Board appointed by the Surgeon General of the Army,<lb/>
on May 24, 1900, became a martyr to science while engaged in yellow<lb/>
fever experiments in Cuba, with the other immortals Walter Reed, James<lb/>
Carroll and Aristides Agramonte. This college feels justly proud of the<lb/>
fact that Dr. Lazear's preparatory education was obtained within its<lb/>
walls and in token thereof dedicates its new Hall of Chemistry to his<lb/>
memory.</p>
<p>Need<lb/>
much<lb/>
modification<lb/>
<unclear>P S H</unclear></p>
<p>Dr. Philip S. Hench, a <del>distingushed</del> member of the MAYO CLINIC,<lb/>
Rochester, Minn., will deliver <del>the principal dedicatory</del> address. Doctor<lb/>
Hench has been accumulating data since 1937 on the history of yellow<lb/>
fever, up to and including the year of its conquest, 1900. Within a few<lb/>
years he plans to publish his findings in book form in which will be set<lb/>
forth the respective parts played in the &ldquo;Conquest of Yellow Fever&rdquo; by<lb/>
Reed, Finlay, Lazear, Carroll and Agramonte. It was while infecting<lb/>
mosquitoes in the yellow fever ward of Las Animas Hospital, Havana, that<lb/>
Dr. Lazear contracted the dread disease, succumbing to it on September<lb/>
25, 1900.</p>
<p>So much by way of explanation. Dr. Hench has recently visited<lb/>
the scenes of Dr. Lazear's last activities, carrying out his investigations<lb/>
on the &ldquo;field of battle&rdquo; in which he reports valuable cooperation on the<lb/>
part of Mr. Moran, your Cuban representative, who knew Dr. Lazear very<lb/>
well and had seen him only a few days before he contracted fatal yellow<lb/>
fever. WASHINGTON &amp; JEFFERSON would feel honored to have Mr. Moran <add><del><unclear></unclear></del> who <add>(ie Maas)</add> was one of the first to volunteer to receive <unclear>experimental</unclear> yellow fever</add><lb/>
present for the date of the inauguration of the Lazear Memorial. When<lb/>
this was suggested to him by Dr. Hench he expressed a sincere desire to<lb/>
participate, at the same time stating that, for economic reasons, he<lb/>
would be compelled to forego the honor. Dr. Hench suggested that the<lb/>
matter of expense of his trip North could possibly be arranged, where-<lb/>
upon another obstacle presented itself. He told Dr. Hench that he had<lb/>
taken a vacation of thirty days last year and that he could not, as a<lb/>
matter of delicacy, apply for another vacation this year. As to the<lb/>
latter obstacle, you alone could decide and we would be very grateful to<lb/>
you if it could be overcome. (As to his travel expenses, I feel reasonably<lb/>
sure we will find a way before October.)</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
<signed>President</signed>.
