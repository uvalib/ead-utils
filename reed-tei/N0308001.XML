<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>HIS RACE WITH DEATH WON BY LAST<lb/>
OF THE YELLOW FEVER PIONEERS</p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p>Dr Henry Ross Carter, the Only Man Who Could Write It, Finished<lb/>
Section 111 of the History of the Dread Disease Only<lb/>
Three Days Before He Died</p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p>By MAYME OBER PEAK</p>
<p>On the rapidly growing roster of<lb/>
America's great peace heroes, dying<lb/>
that others might live, was inscribed<lb/>
recently the name of Dr Henry Ross<lb/>
Carter, Assistant Surgeon General,<lb/>
United States Public Health Service.</p>
<p>The last of that matchless com-<lb/>
pany of pioneers in yellow fever and<lb/>
malaria work--Lazier, Reed, Carroll,<lb/>
Gorgas--who will be credited to the<lb/>
19th century but to whom every age<lb/>
will be debtor, Dr Carter devoted<lb/>
all the energy of his spirit for 50<lb/>
years to ridding the earth of the<lb/>
dread diseases carried by the mos-<lb/>
quito.</p>
<p>His passing, at the age of 73, was<lb/>
as triumphant and heroic as any<lb/>
chapter in his courageous, conse-<lb/>
crated life. Though he died as every<lb/>
man wants to die--surrounded by<lb/>
his loved ones and at peace with his<lb/>
Maker, his end was no less dramatic<lb/>
than that of his comrades in the serv-<lb/>
ice who at the time were meeting<lb/>
sudden, tragic deaths in the air above<lb/>
and in the waters beneath.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Won by Three Days</p>
<p>For two years Dr Carter ran a race<lb/>
with death, to complete what no other<lb/>
living man could write--&ldquo;The History<lb/>
of Yellow Fever, Its Origin and Con-<lb/>
trol.&rdquo; Day and night he faced the<lb/>
grim reaper, faced him as serenely as<lb/>
he had braved him in the exuberance<lb/>
of health when the trail of yellow<lb/>
fever and malaria led him through<lb/>
the tropical jungles of Panama, the<lb/>
oozing swamps of South America, or<lb/>
the marshes of his native Southland.</p>
<p>Absorbed in the battle, oblivious to<lb/>
hardships and dangers, caring nothing<lb/>
for the honors due him, he never came<lb/>
off the fighting line until his body was<lb/>
broken, his heart physically weakened.</p>
<p>For three years Dr Carter warded off<lb/>
complete invalidism, first in crutches<lb/>
and then in a wheel chair. Even after<lb/>
this he attended an important scientific<lb/>
conference in the Tropics, being carried<lb/>
to and from the ship on a stretcher!<lb/>
When finally chained to bed, suffering<lb/>
from severe attacks of angina pectoris,<lb/>
the real race with death began--a race<lb/>
won by the narrow margin of three<lb/>
days.</p>
<p>Battling for breath to dictate Dr Car-<lb/>
ter's spirit was that of the Roman<lb/>
general, whom he quoted when advised<lb/>
to stop work: &ldquo;It is necessary that I<lb/>
get to Pelusium; it is not necessary<lb/>
that I live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get to Pelusium we did,&rdquo; said<lb/>
his daughter, Miss Laura Armstead<lb/>
Carter, whose unselfish devotion to her<lb/>
father as collaborator, secretary, com-<lb/>
panion, comrade, nurse, is one of the<lb/>
beautiful traditions of the service--<lb/>
&ldquo;father, interested, alert, happy and<lb/>
exalted in his great work of final ser-<lb/>
vice up to within a few hours of the<lb/>
heart attack that was the beginning<lb/>
of the end. I--on black coffee, strychi-<lb/>
nine, aspirin, and by the Grace of God!<lb/>
For of course I had to work while he<lb/>
rested, to transcribe the notes he dic-<lb/>
tated, doing this late at night or very<lb/>
early in the morning, as he waked<lb/>
about 5:30, when we had our early<lb/>
coffee together and planned the work<lb/>
for the day.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>No One Else Could Have Done It</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to living only for the work,<lb/>
we finished Section 111, by a three-day<lb/>
margin, and father had the satisfac-<lb/>
tion of knowing that the most impor-<lb/>
tant part of the book was saved. This<lb/>
is as far as I will go with it as it<lb/>
makes a complete entity as it stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Rockefeller Foundation<lb/>
first took up the question of writing<lb/>
the history of yellow fever with Dr<lb/>
Carter, chairman of the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Council of its International Health<lb/>
Board, he had just returned from 18<lb/>
months' service as sanitary adviser<lb/>
to the Peruvian Government. Emaci-<lb/>
ated by fever, lamed by a dislocated<lb/>
hip, he realized that he was on his<lb/>
&ldquo;last legs&rdquo; and did not expect to live<lb/>
long enough to complete the book,<lb/>
which, &lsquo;involving endless research,<lb/>
would take at least five years. He<lb/>
was unwilling to undertake it unless<lb/>
he could so arrange the work as to<lb/>
make every piece count by itself--&rsquo; like<lb/>
building a stairway,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so that<lb/>
whoever comes after me can go on<lb/>
from the step at which I left off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the book was written. The first<lb/>
section was finished three years ago,<lb/>
and mimeographed for the men in the<lb/>
field for use as a textbook. By the<lb/>
yellow fever men this section is known<lb/>
as &ldquo;The Rockefeller Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Section 111 is unique. No one else<lb/>
could have written it. It took a man<lb/>
with a command of many languages,<lb/>
ancient and modern, including Latin<lb/>
as written by the priests at the time<lb/>
of the conquest of the New World;<lb/>
the Maya MSS; the Mexican hiero-<lb/>
glyphics; Portuguese, Spanish, Italian<lb/>
and French. It took a man, too, with<lb/>
a broad and strictly accurate historical<lb/>
background, both for the Old and New<lb/>
World, as well as one who was a rec-<lb/>
ognized world authority on yellow<lb/>
fever, from its epidemiological, clinical<lb/>
and historical standpoints.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Off for Panama</p>
<p>As long as Dr Carter could get about<lb/>
on crutches, he was a familiar figure<lb/>
at the Library of Congress where, day<lb/>
after day, hour after hour, his iron<lb/>
gray head could be seen bent over some<lb/>
massive volume on his desk. After he<lb/>
was tied to a wheel-chair, the library<lb/>
came to the doctor.</p>
<p>Running in for a late cup of tea with<lb/>
the hurrying historian and his faithful<lb/>
scribe at their Washington apartment,<lb/>
the writer would find them buried be-<lb/>
hind a mound of books. The low card-<lb/>
table on which the doctor worked was<lb/>
the only oasis in the desert, and this<lb/>
was littered with notes. On top of the<lb/>
papers the tea tray would be placed,<lb/>
and while we teaed and talked, Dr Car-<lb/>
ter relaxed.</p>
<p>It was on one of the occasions when<lb/>
he was in a particularly mellow mood<lb/>
that he told me of his fight with yellow<lb/>
fever in Panama--one of the most dra-<lb/>
matic campaigns of his war with the<lb/>
enemy. As ranking officer next to Gor-<lb/>
gas, Dr Carter was connected with most<lb/>
of the organization and early work on<lb/>
the Isthmus. He organized the quar-<lb/>
antine service and later served as Di-<lb/>
rector of Hospitals and chairman of the<lb/>
Board of Diagnosis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just three old codgers,&rdquo; he<lb/>
chuckled, lifting his eyes to the finely-<lb/>
chiseled features of &ldquo;the Chief,&rdquo;-Gen<lb/>
Gorgas--framed on the wall, &ldquo;when we<lb/>
went down to Panama to clean up.<lb/>
Gorgas, then colonel, came to me when<lb/>
he was appointed chief sanitary officer<lb/>
of the Canal, and asked me to go along.<lb/>
He said that Rear Admiral Ross, whose<lb/>
yellow fever work in Cuba dated back</p>
<p>-----------------------------------</p>
<p><figure entity="N0308001"></figure> HENRY ROSE CARTER<lb/>
Late Assistant Surgeon General,<lb/>
United States Public Health Service</p>
<p>-----------------------------------</p>
<p>to the momentous days of the Reed<lb/>
Board, had promised to go if I would,<lb/>
and that as it would be probably the<lb/>
last work we old codgers would do,<lb/>
he thought we ought to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agreed with him. And we set forth<lb/>
on the adventure in high spirits. We<lb/>
reached Panama in June, in extremely<lb/>
hot weather. It rained four times a<lb/>
day. When it stopped and the sun<lb/>
would come out, it was like opening<lb/>
the door of a furnace.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>One Candle for Four Rooms</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were assigned quarters in an old<lb/>
building in Ancon. Gorgas, Ross and I<lb/>
shared the same room, the same bu-<lb/>
reau. Gorgas had the top drawer, I<lb/>
the middle drawer, and Ross the bot-<lb/>
tom. If any guests came, they put<lb/>
their things on the floor! We hung<lb/>
our top clothes on the wall, covering<lb/>
them with a gorgeous flowered curtain<lb/>
purchased from a Chinaman in Panama.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The private bath was my trunk,<lb/>
turned upside down, with bowl and<lb/>
pitcher on top. The washstand proper<lb/>
had to be used for a desk. We slept<lb/>
on cots and had pillows that you blow<lb/>
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody had to turn in at the<lb/>
same time at night. There were no<lb/>
lamps then, and as I was the only one<lb/>
who had thought to bring candles, they<lb/>
had to be made to go a long way.<lb/>
For each of the four sleeping rooms,<lb/>
occupied by 15 other officers and em-<lb/>
ployes, the nightly allotment was a<lb/>
fourth of a candle. No man dared to<lb/>
go to bed without first killing all the<lb/>
mosquitoes in his net.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galleries ran all round the build-<lb/>
ing, upstairs and down. We bought<lb/>
all the wire netting we could find in<lb/>
Panama and screened off a small por-<lb/>
tion of the upper gallery, dubbing it<lb/>
&lsquo;the cage.&rsquo; Here we sat after dinner,<lb/>
reviewing the day and enjoying the<lb/>
soft, cool breezes and the lovely view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the Americans, the poor food<lb/>
and the lack of ice were the greatest<lb/>
hardships. There was no water sup-<lb/>
ply--and thereon hangs the tale of yel-<lb/>
low fever in Panama!</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Fixing Mosquito's Guilt</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest difficulty was in ob-<lb/>
taining the necessary legal authority to<lb/>
clean up; the next was to get the neces-<lb/>
sary sanitary supplies. We personally<lb/>
had seen to it that several tons of<lb/>
sulphur, acids, alcohol and sulphur pots<lb/>
were carried to the New York wharf<lb/>
of the Panama Steamship Company and<lb/>
put on the same ship with us, only to<lb/>
find it tied up in red tape on arrival<lb/>
that took us months to unwind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross billed his consignment to the<lb/>
Isthmian Commission; I billed mine to<lb/>
myself at LaBoca. He got his in the<lb/>
Spring by the requisition route. I got<lb/>
mine by cart, as I could personally<lb/>
haul it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning we paid too much<lb/>
attention to isolating the patient. Hav-<lb/>
ing proved the responsibility of the<lb/>
Stegomyia fasciata, as we then called<lb/>
it, for the carriage of yellow fever, we<lb/>
know now that there is no danger from<lb/>
close contact with the patient, even from<lb/>
sleeping in the same bed with him. The<lb/>
only danger is from the mosquitoes that<lb/>
have bitten him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing we have proved is that<lb/>
mosquitoes do not breed in swamps,<lb/>
mud puddles or street gutters unless<lb/>
they are lined with something and have<lb/>
no mud sides. We have formulated that<lb/>
they do not breed in any collection of<lb/>
water, the sides of which at the water's<lb/>
edge are of mud. They do breed in col-<lb/>
lections of water in artificial containers<lb/>
and in similar things such as cisterns,<lb/>
tin pans, water put out for chickens,<lb/>
to drink, saucers under the legs of<lb/>
tables to keep the ants off, and so on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Panama the Stegomyia bred in<lb/>
just these things. There was no city<lb/>
water supply. Everybody stored water<lb/>
in their homes in artificial containers.<lb/>
They saved rain water, or bought from<lb/>
the aguadores--carriers who got water<lb/>
from the wells and peddled it through<lb/>
the streets on the backs of mules.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Dishpan Put Ship in Danger</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dishpan came very near causing<lb/>
the death of the personnel of a battle-<lb/>
ship. Called out of bed one night by an<lb/>
orderly from the Boston, then in the<lb/>
harbor, I found on reaching the ship<lb/>
that six men were ill with the fever,<lb/>
including the ship's doctor, two officers<lb/>
and the mess steward. Searching the<lb/>
ship for the source of the trouble, we<lb/>
discovered outside the cook's quarters<lb/>
a dishpan of water that was almost a<lb/>
soup of wiggletales of Stegomyia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On New Year's night we had at-<lb/>
tended a &lsquo;sing-song&rsquo; on board the Bos-<lb/>
ton. Evidently there had been a walk-<lb/>
ing case of yellow fever among the<lb/>
numerous guests. The Stegomyia that<lb/>
had bitten him were breeding death for<lb/>
the whole ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was difficult for the Panamanians<lb/>
to get used to our treatment of yellow<lb/>
fever. Though immune themselves,<lb/>
having had yellow fever when they<lb/>
were children, they remembered the<lb/>
terrible toil it had exacted from the<lb/>
French, and were horrified at the risks<lb/>
the Americans took. When Mrs Gorgas<lb/>
and my family joined us, six months<lb/>
after arriving on the isthmus, we<lb/>
shared quarters on the second floor of<lb/>
an old French building formerly used<lb/>
as a hospital for the officers of the<lb/>
French Canal Company. Under us was<lb/>
the officers' mess, where we all ate<lb/>
together, and under the chapel where<lb/>
we had the yellow fever funerals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diagonally across the road was the<lb/>
yellow fever hospital, the doors and<lb/>
windows always open. Neither had<lb/>
glass nor shutters, but were thickly<lb/>
screened. There were also double<lb/>
screen doors at the entrance, with a<lb/>
smudge fire burning between, and an<lb/>
orderly constantly on duty to keep<lb/>
them going and to brush off the clothes<lb/>
of the doctors and nurses as they went<lb/>
in and out. Also, the patients were in<lb/>
mosquito-proof cages, so it was really<lb/>
impossible for Stegomyia to get in and<lb/>
become infected by them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to the horror of the Pana-<lb/>
manians, my daughter--the first Ameri-<lb/>
can girl on the Isthmus, would sit on<lb/>
the steps of the hospital and wait for<lb/>
me whenever she felt inclined. &lsquo;You<lb/>
must wish her to become an angel!&rsquo;<lb/>
they protested.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Coffins for All Six</p>
<p>&ldquo;When an official died with yellow<lb/>
fever, there was a general panic. If<lb/>
an Italian laborer died, no notice was<lb/>
taken of it, though there was as much<lb/>
danger from one as the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who were case-hardened or<lb/>
educated up to the mosquito theory of<lb/>
course could joke about it. I remember<lb/>
when the Isthmian Canal Commission<lb/>
came to Panama--six in number, the<lb/>
seventh member being in Paris--one of<lb/>
the commissioners noticed six metallic<lb/>
coffins that had been unloaded from<lb/>
the same ship and laid out on the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the half dozen coffins?&rdquo; he<lb/>
asked an official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know Mr Parsons didn't<lb/>
come,&rdquo; was the quick reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The commissionerss slept on board<lb/>
that night and every other night while<lb/>
in Panama.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the symptoms of yellow<lb/>
fever?&rdquo; I once asked Dr Carter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Similar to the first stages of acute<lb/>
alcoholism--red, flushed face, swollen<lb/>
lips, vomiting, headache. As the tem-<lb/>
perature rises the pulse falls away from<lb/>
it. If the two rise and cross, then it<lb/>
is le nocud fatal--the fatal knot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the treatment?&rdquo; I queried<lb/>
further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It rests upon a tripod. Absolute rest<lb/>
in bed; complete starvation for a rea-<lb/>
sonable time, and as much water as<lb/>
patient can be made to take without<lb/>
vomiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any ill effects?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically none whatever. Yellow<lb/>
fever has no sequence. The poison<lb/>
passes rapidly through the system,<lb/>
either killing the patient in five or<lb/>
seven days or leaving entirely. There<lb/>
is little suffering connected with it, save<lb/>
in the beginning. The victim lies in a<lb/>
coma or stupor, and is very, very<lb/>
weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Both Surgeon and Engineer</p>
<p>Dr Carter spoke from experience. Like<lb/>
his chief, Gen Gorgas, he suffered from<lb/>
an attack of yellow fever early in the<lb/>
game. In the Summer of 1897, follow-<lb/>
ing the campaign in the fever-infected<lb/>
districts of Louisiana and Mississippi,<lb/>
he contracted the disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I had it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and<lb/>
spent the first day winding up import-<lb/>
ant official matters. For days after I<lb/>
entered the hospital at New Orleans I<lb/>
was so weak that only when the thirst<lb/>
became more than I could bear would I<lb/>
expend enough energy to lift my thumb,<lb/>
to which a bell was tied, to call the<lb/>
nurse. I figured it out that since<lb/>
water was a word of two syllables, it<lb/>
required less effort to say &lsquo;drink&rsquo; and<lb/>
this was the one mental calculation I<lb/>
made and the one word I uttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the Panama campaign, I jolly<lb/>
well sympathized with one of the pa-<lb/>
tients who had black water fever. He<lb/>
insisted upon going home before the<lb/>
was well enough to leave the hospital.<lb/>
&lsquo;Don't you know you are a mighty weak<lb/>
man?&rsquo; the colonel reminded him.<lb/>
&lsquo;That's just it,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;let me go<lb/>
home and get a little strength, and<lb/>
then I'll come back and you can doctor<lb/>
me all you please!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr Carter remained on the Isthmus<lb/>
five years. For his conspicious service<lb/>
in connection with the building of the<lb/>
Canal, Congress created for him the<lb/>
position of Assistant Surgeon General-<lb/>
at-Large of the United States Public<lb/>
Health Service, thus breaking all prece-<lb/>
dents in recognizing the work of a mem-<lb/>
ber of that service.</p>
<p>Since the modern viewpoint is that<lb/>
public health is a problem for engin-<lb/>
eers rather than doctors, Dr Carter's<lb/>
accomplishments as a scientific worker<lb/>
in sanitation is largely due perhaps to<lb/>
the fact that he was both an engineer<lb/>
and a doctor. In 1873 has was gradu-<lb/>
ated from the University of Virginia<lb/>
as civil and mining engineer, and in<lb/>
1879 form the University of Maryland<lb/>
as an M. D. In 1911 this latter univer-<lb/>
sity conferred upon him the degree of<lb/>
LL.D.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>His List of Achievements</p>
<p>Immediately after he was graduated<lb/>
in medicine he entered the Marine Hos-<lb/>
pital Service (now the Public Health<lb/>
Service). In the Fall of that same year<lb/>
he saw his first case of yellow fever--<lb/>
in the epidemic at Memphis, of which<lb/>
he had charge.</p>
<p>It was at Ship Island Quarantine Sta-<lb/>
tion, in the Gulf of Mexico, that he had<lb/>
unique opportunity to study at length<lb/>
the disease of far-reaching public health<lb/>
and economic importance, and prevent<lb/>
its entrance into the country. To this<lb/>
Federal refuge station came all vessels<lb/>
infected, or thought to be infected.<lb/>
Many of them were sailing vessels from<lb/>
Rio, Santos, Havana and Colon--all<lb/>
danger zones at that time.</p>
<p>Here on this lonely island, cut off<lb/>
from communication from the outside<lb/>
world except by boat call, Dr Carter,<lb/>
with a young family growing up around<lb/>
him, practically laid the foundation of<lb/>
his great work for the control and pre-<lb/>
vention of yellow fever.</p>
<p>Briefly summarized, his sanitary and<lb/>
scientific achievements were:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1--The determination of the period of<lb/>
extrinsic incubation of yellow fever<lb/>
which determined the direction of the<lb/>
brilliant work of the Reed Commis-<lb/>
sioner, and for which Dr Carter was<lb/>
nominated for the Nobel Prize by Sir<lb/>
Ronald Ross.</item>
<item>2--The founding of the present mari-<lb/>
time quarantine system of the United<lb/>
States.</item>
<item>3--The control of numerous yellow<lb/>
fever epidemics in the Southern States.</item>
<item>4--The inauguration of the quarantine<lb/>
systems of Cuba and the Canal Zone.</item>
<item>5--The initiation of malaria control in<lb/>
the United States.</item>
<item>6--The enunciation of principles relat-<lb/>
ing to the bearing of impounding of<lb/>
great bodies of water on the production<lb/>
of malaria, a matter in which the eco-<lb/>
nomic future of the Southern States is<lb/>
bound up.</item>
<item>7--The control of malaria during the<lb/>
late War in the extra-cantonment<lb/>
areas of the camps and regions around<lb/>
the big industrial plants engaged in<lb/>
production of war material.</item>
<item>8--Numerous articles on yellow fever<lb/>
and malaria, also sections on yellow<lb/>
fever in several systems of medicine,<lb/>
published here and abroad.</item>
<item>9--History of yellow fever for the<lb/>
Rockefeller Foundation.</item>

<p>Testament Ever With Him</p>
<p>Seeking the contributing factors to so<lb/>
remarkable a record, aside from Dr<lb/>
Carter's natural ability, one finds that<lb/>
his life of many-sided service was<lb/>
molded by a woman--his mother. Pos-<lb/>
sessed of a singularly clear and power-<lb/>
ful intellect, deeply religious, with def-<lb/>
inite views as to duty to God and man,<lb/>
she set her son's feet upon the right<lb/>
trail and imbued him with the ideals<lb/>
that kept them there.</p>
<p>As a child Henry Carter was very<lb/>
delicate. He was well in his teens be-<lb/>
fore he left home to attend Aspen Hill<lb/>
Academy. All of his early education<lb/>
was obtained from his mother and from<lb/>
private tutors.</p>
<p>When he went out into the world,<lb/>
a pocket edition of the New Testament<lb/>
and Psalms was the compass that<lb/>
guided him on his uncharted course.<lb/>
Never a morning passed that he did not<lb/>
read it. So worn was it from constant<lb/>
use that when he died it was practically<lb/>
rebound in adhesive plaster!</p>
<p>Henery Carter was born on the Clif-<lb/>
ton plantation, Caroline County, Va.</p>
<p>It was by the side of his fathers, in<lb/>
the little cemetery near Ashland, Va,<lb/>
that Dr Carter was laid to rest. A<lb/>
special train brought the flag-draped<lb/>
casket from Washington, accompanied<lb/>
by a military guard of honor, by his<lb/>
colleagues in the service, by dignitaries<lb/>
in official life and men high in the<lb/>
scientific and medical world, headed by<lb/>
his two chiefs, Surgeon General Hugh<lb/>
Cumming of the United States Public<lb/>
Health Service, and Dr George E. Vin-<lb/>
cent, chairman of the Rockefeller<lb/>
Foundation.</p>
<p>As he passed on his way to higher<lb/>
service between the lines of khaki-clad<lb/>
men at salute, it was as though he were<lb/>
again taking the field--not leaving it.</p>
