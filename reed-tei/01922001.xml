<salute>Dear General:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just returned and find that the Yellow Fever<lb/>
epidemic here is confined entirely to the American residents of the<lb/>
city. The Americans working in your street gangs have escaped; only<lb/>
one having been taken down thus far. This percentage is much lower<lb/>
than the general percentage among the American occupants and goes to<lb/>
prove very conclusively, I think, that the street work has not been<lb/>
the cause of the epidemic. The troops have all been removed from the<lb/>
city to safe points inland, points at which Yellow Fever has never<lb/>
originated. The death rate among the officers has been very heavy;<lb/>
everyone who has taken it has died. At present it seems to be of a<lb/>
milder type and for the last five days we have had no new cases among<lb/>
the troops, and the old cases are all convalescent. Since my arrival<lb/>
yesterday morning I have been on the jump trying to establish the ab-<lb/>
solutely necessary measures which should have been established two<lb/>
weeks ago. (Confidentially), I have been simply horrified to find how<lb/>
little has been done to check the thing.</p>
<p>The unwashed American element is having a hard time, as I am ar-<lb/>
resting every American, scrubbing, disinfecting and putting him on a<lb/>

Gral. Greene. No. 2<lb/>
disinfected ship in the harbour where, after seven days healthful stay<lb/>
he will be shipped out of the country willing, or unwilling. I have<lb/>
tied the whole place up with a cast-iron military order which is<lb/>
going to cause a great deal of kicking, but which I think will save<lb/>
a great many lives, and I hope soon to check the spread of the dis-<lb/>
ease. There sems to be no particular point of infection. The native<lb/>
doctors are inclined to think that the great heat and unusual drought<lb/>
are responsible for it. There are no cases among the native popula-<lb/>
tion and their death rate from other causes are unusually low, in fact<lb/>
outside the Yellow Fever among our own people, the city is in an un-<lb/>
usual good state of health.</p>
<p>I saw your nephew yesterday; he is looking well. I have advised<lb/>
your superintendent that unless the epidemic is promptly checked, we<lb/>
had better finish up what streets we have open and discontinue work<lb/>
until the first of October. By that time, I hope we shall have money<lb/>
enough to do even more work than we contemplated.</p>
<p>With kindest reagrds and thanking you for the very many cour-<lb/>
tesies which you extended to me during my visit,</p>
<p>I am,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
