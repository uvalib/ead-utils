<salute>Dear P. W.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Well I'm back in Ancon<lb/>
hospital again. Dr Mac<lb/>
Murdo wanted to get<lb/>
on the <unclear>Line</unclear> to study<lb/>
for the Army Examination<lb/>
and so I was sent into<lb/>
Ancon Hospital to take<lb/>
his place while he went<lb/>
to Bas Obispo</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00748002"/>
<p>I am back on the Surgical<lb/>
Side. I am glad to again<lb/>
be in Hospital more so<lb/>
as I thought I would not<lb/>
get back again. It certainly<lb/>
was nice to see how<lb/>
sorry Dr Caldwell and the<lb/>
others were to see me leave<lb/>
the <unclear>Line</unclear> Caldwell said<lb/>
that I was one of the<lb/>
very best men he had ever<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00748003"/>
had with him while on the<lb/>
<unclear>Line</unclear>. I certainly had a pleasent<lb/>
time on the <unclear>Line</unclear> and its put me<lb/>
in fine physical shape, now that<lb/>
I am back at Ancon I can't tell<lb/>
when I will be up on Vacation<lb/>
as one has the time assigned<lb/>
here and can not take their leaves<lb/>
when one wants it. But its<lb/>
certainly good to get back<lb/>
to hospital work again. You<lb/>
must excuse the time I've taken<lb/>
to write but its taken some<lb/>
time to get back and straighten<lb/>
out in my new quarters</p>
<p>The boys here were delighted to<lb/>
see me again and gave me<lb/>
the &ldquo;glad hand&rdquo; on my return in<lb/>
great shape</p>
<pb n="4" id="f00748004"/>
<p>Tell Laura the scetch I<lb/>
sent her was mearly<lb/>
the rough plot of a<lb/>
story I wanted her to<lb/>
write as the plot is<lb/>
good and I think she<lb/>
could make a good<lb/>
story of it I expect Papa<lb/>
is back by this time<lb/>
and that he has bought<lb/>
Edward home with<lb/>
him. It must be<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00748005"/>
a satisfaction to have them<lb/>
at home once more. I trust<lb/>
that Papa was much<lb/>
improved by his stay at<lb/>
Johns Hopkins and that<lb/>
he and all of you are well<lb/>
Laura wrote that you<lb/>
had been sick. Ere now<lb/>
I trust that you are well<lb/>
again. Well by the next<lb/>
letter I hope to be able<lb/>
to let you know when<lb/>
I will be up on vacation<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00748006"/>
I certainly look foward to the time<lb/>
I'll be at home as then we will<lb/>
again all be togeather and this time<lb/>
I'll be in good health and able to<lb/>
enjoy all of my time at home.<lb/>
All of the people here ask that<lb/>
I send love when I write<lb/>
most of all the Herricks.</p>
<p>Well good bye and keep well<lb/>
I will write more next time<lb/>
with love</p>
