Mr. Harry L. Freer<lb/>
War Department<lb/>
Office of the Chief of Engineers<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Freer:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I had some correspondence with you some months ago in an attempt to<lb/>
locate some of the old maps of Camp Columbia or Columbia Barracks, Havana, Cuba,<lb/>
as of 1899-1902. You were kind enough to send me a copy of the 1902 map but<lb/>
could not find the key to this map. In an attempt to find this or maps of Camp<lb/>
Columbia earlier than 1902, I visited the Chief of Engineers at Ciudad Militar,<lb/>
Havana, Cuba, and I found tattered blueprints of the three maps, small photographs<lb/>
of which I had taken. The photographs are merely portions of the map as I was<lb/>
interested chiefly in the eastern end of Columbia Barracks. They had no extra<lb/>
copies nor did they have the original from which the blueprints were made.<lb/>
Do you have in your department the originals of these three maps, and if so,<lb/>
would it be possible for me to have one or two blueprints of each of them? The<lb/>
one I have marked &ldquo;A&rdquo; is the 1899 map, the one marked &ldquo;B&rdquo; is the 1901 modification<lb/>
of the 1899 map and the one marked &ldquo;C&rdquo; is a property map of Columbia Barracks,<lb/>
dated 1902.</p>
<p>In an attempt to locate the key to the 1902 map I stopped over in Wash-<lb/>
ington a couple of months ago and former Surgeon-General Ireland took me to the<lb/>
Map Collection of the War Department, in the Army War College. The sergeant in<lb/>
charge showed me an 1898 map of Columbia Barracks and two 1899 maps. They did not<lb/>
have any of the ones that I enclose nor did they have the key to the 1902 map.<lb/>
The sergeant in charge could not at the moment find the original of his three<lb/>
maps--the 1898 one and the two 1899 maps. Do you know whether these originals<lb/>
are in your office and if so, could I obtain a couple of blueprints of them?</p>
<p>The Chief of Engineers of the Military City at Havana (the Military<lb/>
City being the headquarters of the Cuban army) was anxious to have me find out<lb/>
whether I could locate the above mentioned maps. They did not have them in their<lb/>
own collection and are so anxious to obtain copies of them. from you if at all<lb/>
possible, to complete their own collection. I have the films of the three fragments,<lb/>
photographs of which are enclosed, and should you wish further copies, I will be<lb/>
glad to have them made for you.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
