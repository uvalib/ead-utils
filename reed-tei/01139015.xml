<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Much obliged to you for the clipping by young Dr. Finlay<lb/>
just received.</p>
<p>Both Finlay and Guiteras felt that Finlay's work had been<lb/>
insufficiently recognized as, indeed, did Gorgas and myself. In<lb/>
fact Guiteras made rather a sharp attack on Osler for leaving Fin-<lb/>
lay's name out in a paper he wrote some time (probably ten years) ago<lb/>
on the insect conveyance of disease. My view of the matter, as<lb/>
well as I could express it, you will find on the first page or two<lb/>
of the article on yellow fever in the &ldquo;Practise of Medicine in the<lb/>
Tropics&rdquo;: Oxford Press.</p>
<p>So far as the &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; that George Finlay claims is con-<lb/>
cerned, it is a question of the use of the word. Had Columbus dis-<lb/>
covered that the world was round when he sailed from Palos, or was this<lb/>
left to Magellan, or possibly Balboa? Columbus formulated this<lb/>
statement and was absolutely convinced of it, but had not demon-<lb/>
strated it, at that time: Finlay announced the mosquito convey-<lb/>
ance and was absolutely convinced of it--I do not believe Reed's<lb/>
experiments added an iota to his certainty of it; as I think Colum-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01139016"/>
Colum-<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
bus would have been surprised if he had not run up upon his &ldquo;Ci-<lb/>
pango.&rdquo; Finlay had data that was absolutely convincing to himself,<lb/>
as had Columbus--and the convictions in both cases were right--in<lb/>
neither case, however, had this data convinced the rest of the world.<lb/>
I doubt if Columbus had stopped at Palos whether he would have been<lb/>
considered the discoverer of the rotundity of the earth.</p>
<p>To what extent Reed was influenced by Finlay's theory I do<lb/>
not know. He always said in no way, which seems scarcely credible.<lb/>
He declined to let me explain it to him when I visited him at Que-<lb/>
mados. the Fourth of July, 1899, as he said he did not wish to be<lb/>
biased by <unclear>anyone'</unclear> else's opinion. I will say this though, that if I<lb/>
had read all that Finlay had written up to that time, I would have<lb/>
considered it as &ldquo;establishing so strong an antecedent probability&rdquo;<lb/>
for his views that I would have begged for an experimental try-out.<lb/>
Frankly, I think that my own work in determining the existence of<lb/>
the &ldquo;period of extrinsic incubation of yellow fever,&rdquo; taken with<lb/>
Ronald Ross' on the conveyance of malaria determined the direction<lb/>
of his experimentation. He practically says this in his first<lb/>
paper<del>.</del> and did so repeatedly in letters and conversations.</p>
<p>The quotation from Dr. Carlos Finlay given in the clipping<lb/>
is, I have no doubt, true. It is just what he would have said and<lb/>
felt. He was one of the kindest, fairest and most unselfish men<lb/>
I have known.</p>
<p>Again thanking you for the clipping,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
</closer>
