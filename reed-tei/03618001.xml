<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Regarding your letter<lb/>
concerning Walter Reed matters: It arrived here while I<lb/>
was away in the North country and for several weeks after<lb/>
my return I was confined to the hospital and my own bed.</p>
<p>You are at liberty to send<lb/>
copies of any of my photographs in the Walter Reed book to<lb/>
Cuba or elsewhere, simply giving recognition to the source.<lb/>
I did not secure anything directly from Walter Reed since<lb/>
he had died before I undertook his life and work, but was in<lb/>
touch with Doctor Carroll and to the best of my memory, the<lb/>
pictures and associated data came to me from him. I have<lb/>
a definite memory of getting them from a direct authoritative<lb/>
source, that is to say, one of the little group which after<lb/>
all boils itself down to Carroll. I had no personal<lb/>
relations whatsoever with Agramonte. I have no negatives<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03618002"/>
AC<lb/>
In to L<lb/>
of the pictures. I have a clear recollection of the<lb/>
statement made that the particular building so declared was<lb/>
the one in which the infected clothing experiments were tried<lb/>
out. This matter was proven in a building identical to that<lb/>
known as the &ldquo;Infected Mosquito Building&rdquo; except that the latter<lb/>
was divided near the middle by a permanent wire screen partition<lb/>
and had good ventilation while the former was so constructed as to<lb/>
exclude anything like efficient ventilation. Please inform<lb/>
Mr. Moran that my information concerning the figure by the<lb/>
building certainly came from the person who supplied the<lb/>
photograph and is, therefore, reliable.</p>
<p>So many years have passed since I gathered material for<lb/>
the book that I cannot positively assert where I got the<lb/>
statement of Reed, <del><unclear>said</unclear></del>, &ldquo;Gentlemen, I salute you,&rdquo; but I am<lb/>
sure it was not picked up out of the air.</p>
<p>I do not know where Reed's daughter Blossom lives, but<lb/>
the last address I had for Mrs. Walter Reed is Burlington Hotel,<lb/>
Vermont Avenue, Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>In April, 1928, Mrs. Mabel H. Lazear lived at<lb/>

<p>I do not know whether Doctor Carroll has any survivors.</p>

P.S. If you come this way at any time, I shall be glad to<lb/>
place the somewhat abundant material before you.<lb/>
