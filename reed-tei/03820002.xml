<title>Letter from Merritte W. Ireland to Philip Showalter Hench, July 17, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Ireland thanks Hench for the photographs and copy of his speech. He feels Kissinger should be sent to a Veterans Bureau Hospital, not to Walter Reed Hospital. He refers Hench to a friend, in Washington, who has a suggestion about locating Camp Lazear. He informs Hench that Blossom Reed has recovered well from her illness.</p>

Doctor Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
The Mayo Clinic,<lb/>
Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you very much for your letter of July 10th<lb/>
inclosing photographs you took when we were down at Washing-<lb/>
ton Barracks and a copy of your address at the unveiling cere-<lb/>
monies at Cleveland. It was very nice of you to send me the<lb/>
photographs and the copy of your address which I have read<lb/>
again with a great deal of interest. I missed in your address<lb/>
the preliminary remarks you made with reference to your con-<lb/>
tact with the Wythe people when you were a youngster. Those re-<lb/>
marks appealed to me very much.</p>
<p>Your letter to George Carroll was an extremely nice<lb/>
one and I am very glad you wrote him. My guess is that you will<lb/>
not receive a reply from him. I intended to take your address<lb/>
down to him and give it to him and tell him personally of the un-<lb/>
veiling ceremony at Cleveland. I am not sure that we are going to<lb/>
get any response from him but I think we should be nice to him and<lb/>
give him all the information we have.</p>
<p>I am sorry about Kissinger, sorry that he had his cere-<lb/>
bral accident and sorry that he is hanging on. If he is to be hos-<lb/>
pitalized he should be sent to the Veterans Bureau hospital at In-<lb/>
dianapolis or some place in that vicinity. Walter Reed is not the<lb/>
place for him. They can only keep patients for a certain length<lb/>
of time at Walter Reed and I don't think that they take these<lb/>
chronic cases. If they had any other policy, in a very short time<lb/>
Walter Reed would not be an active hospital but would be a home for<lb/>
people chronically ill.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ireland and I enjoyed our meetings in Cleveland<lb/>
very much but I did not get an opportunity to tell you one thing.<lb/>
I have a newspaper friend here, David Rankin Barbee, who is quite<lb/>
a research man and who knows as much about the yellow fever inves-<lb/>
tigations as any newspaper man. When I told him the story of your<lb/>
trips to Havana and the purchase of the cabin down there and your<lb/>
determination to have it placed where it would be cared for in the<lb/>
future, he remarked that the Walter Reed reservation here in the<lb/>
District is the only place for it. I am giving you this statement<lb/>
for what it is worth from a newspaper man who is a great friend of<lb/>
medical people.</p>
<p>Yes, Blossom Reed has been ill and it was the intention to<lb/>
transfer her to Walter Reed hospital but the news comes now that she<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03820003"/>
-2-<lb/>
is very, very much better and I hope will be on her feet before<lb/>
very long. My understanding is that the so-called heart at-<lb/>
tack was not serious.</p>
<p>Don't fail to let us know when you expect to make your<lb/>
trip this way in the Fall.</p>
<p>With cordial good wishes,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>

Gen Keans son is taking<lb/>
his vacation just now, and<lb/>
Saturday will <unclear>come</unclear> for Gen Mrs<lb/>
Kean and take them to his house<lb/>
in Richmond for a week. You<lb/>
<unclear>can</unclear> imagine how happy he will<lb/>
be down there with his <unclear>son</unclear> and<lb/>
two grandchildren. We gave<lb/>
Kean a fine 81 &ldquo;birthday party<lb/>
June 27&rdquo;<lb/>
