<title>Letter from George E. Armstrong to Philip Showalter Hench, August 22, 1952</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Armstrong informs Hench he will be unable to attend the Camp Lazear dedication, but that he thinks Streit is a more appropriate representative anyway. Furthermore, Lawrence Reed, Blossom Reed and Truby will all be unable to attend as well. He mentions the possibility of financial assistance for representatives, but notes that aid for the memorial would require an act of Congress.</p>

IN REPLY REFER TO<lb/>
MEDDA<lb/>
619.3 (Camp Lezear) C<lb/>
Philip S. Hench, M. D.<lb/>
Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This is in reply to your four-page letter to me of 12 August which<lb/>
concerned the coming dedication of certain memorials at the site of old<lb/>
Camp Lazear in Cuba. General Love visited us just as your letter<lb/>
arrived and we had a lengthy discussion of the problem with him.</p>
<p>I am inclosing a separate letter which was designed to be in such<lb/>
form that you could make whatever use of it you deem desirable.</p>
<p>In this letter I shall touch on such of the points brought up in<lb/>
your letters of 12 August as seem to solicit or warrant comment by me.<lb/>
You will recognize, of course, that in many of the areas of interest<lb/>
I can offer little more than my personal views or estimate of possi-<lb/>
bilities.</p>
<p>I definitely share your views that it would be most desirable that<lb/>
the United States Army be represented at the ceremonies and it is, of<lb/>
course possible that such representation may serve to influence favor-<lb/>
ably the decision of the Cuban Government as to the names to be accorded<lb/>
to the memorials. I would be more than glad to attend personally, but<lb/>
unfortunately my schedule is a heavy one during September, October and<lb/>
November and includes trips outside of the Continental United States.<lb/>
It, therefore, would seem to me unwise to attempt to commit myself to<lb/>
attend the dedication, especially in view of the fact that its date is<lb/>
somewhat uncertain. I have, however, a suggestion of a representative<lb/>
who by nature of his position would be even more appropriate than<lb/>
myself. Major General Paul H. Streit, who as you know is Commanding<lb/>
General of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Walter Reed Army<lb/>
Hospital, can be made available in the event that an invitation is<lb/>
forthcoming through the usual diplomatic channels. The fact that his<lb/>
position and official title carry so prominently the name of Walter<lb/>
Reed, it would seem to me that there might, thus, result gentle but<lb/>
firm pressure which might influence the Cuban Government to give Walter<lb/>
Reed's name equal prominence to that of Finlay.</p>
<p>Should an invitation be extended by the Cuban Government either<lb/>
through the State Department or direct to me in my official capacity,<lb/>
I shall be more than glad to nominate General Streit as my representative.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f04506011"/>
<p>MEDDA<lb/>
Dr. Hench</p>
<p>22 August 1952</p>
<p>Concerning the possibility of Americans other than General Streit<lb/>
attending the dedication, General Love tells me that he already has<lb/>
contacted Major General Walter L. Reed and ascertained that it would be<lb/>
impossible for the latter to attend. General Love also tells me that<lb/>
General Truby has been in poor health and would be physically unable to<lb/>
make the trip. He further feels that Walter Reed's daughter, Mrs.<lb/>
Blossom Reed, is not in a position to attend. I have full confidence<lb/>
in General Love's judgment in these cases.</p>
<p>I have been unable to obtain firsthand information as to the<lb/>
physical status of Dr. Robert P. Cooke or Mr. James L. Hanberry, nor<lb/>
do I know what their attitude would be should they receive an invitation<lb/>
to attend the ceremonies.</p>
<p>I am inclosing herewith a list of the names of the American<lb/>
volunteers who participated in the original experiments and who were<lb/>
placed on the honor roll by act of Congress. In each instance I have<lb/>
attempted to obtain full names including the middle name of each.<lb/>
I have contacted in this connection the National Archives, the Veterans<lb/>
Administration and the Adjutant General, but only the latter was able<lb/>
to supply information which I have reason to believe is as complete as<lb/>
may be had. I am assured that the names as recorded on the inclosure<lb/>
are in exact accord with the Adjutant General's records and that where<lb/>
no middle name appears, it is presumed that none was possessed or at<lb/>
least none was recorded. I cannot obtain any satisfactory information<lb/>
as to why John Bullard's name carries only a middle initial. Unfortu-<lb/>
nately, I cannot be sure that this information will serve to clarify<lb/>
your data, but at least it may be accepted as official from the stand-<lb/>
point of the Department of the Army.</p>
<p>I have given very careful thought to the possibility of some<lb/>
approach to the Cuban Government with reference to the name or names<lb/>
to be memorialized. I have reached the conclusion that there is no<lb/>
approach in my power which would assuredly avoid the possibility of<lb/>
some resentment on the part of the Cubans. The same possibilities of<lb/>
difficulties would exist whether I suggested an approach through the<lb/>
State Department or through the Military Attache direct. It would<lb/>
seem to me, therefore, that the personal contacts which you have<lb/>
established in Cuba stand far more chance of bearing fruit than any<lb/>
line of action within my capacities.</p>
<p>With reference to travel expenses for Americans attending the<lb/>
ceremonies if invited, I probably can arrange for General Streit's<lb/>
travel on Army orders and at the expense of the United States Army.<lb/>
Limitations on the use of funds either under my personal control or<lb/>
under that of the Secretary of the Army would seem to indicate it is<lb/>
2<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f04506012"/>
MEDDA<lb/>
Dr. Hench<lb/>
22 August 1952<lb/>
impossible to assist in the case of any other of the individuals who<lb/>
might be considered. There is, however, the possibility that the State<lb/>
Department might consider it a good investment in Cuban-American rela-<lb/>
tions to underwrite the expenses of some other representative or<lb/>
representatives. This is purely a personal guess on my part and its<lb/>
validity probably would rest on two factors: First, the nature of the<lb/>
invitation extended by the Cuban Government, and secondly, the State<lb/>
Department's present thinking regarding the desirability of making<lb/>
special effort to cement goodwill of the Cuban Government.</p>
<p>I wish that it were possible for me to offer some helpful sugges-<lb/>
tions regarding the provision of funds either for suitable inclosure<lb/>
of the memorials or for future care, but I am unable to do so. Em-<lb/>
ployment of official funds would not be possible except by special<lb/>
act of Congress. Such act, of course, would require the active sponsor-<lb/>
ship of a Senator of member of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>I cannot close without expressing my admiration for the tremendous<lb/>
amount of time and effort, to say nothing of expense, which you have<lb/>
devoted to this project. If, of course, is unnecessary for me to say<lb/>
how highly we in the Army regard any effort which serves to accord<lb/>
proper recognition to the efforts of Walter Reed and his associates.<lb/>
I hope that the obstacles which you have encountered will be overcome<lb/>
and assure you that I shall stand ready at any time to do anything<lb/>
within my power to be of assistance.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
