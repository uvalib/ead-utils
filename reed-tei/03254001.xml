<salute>Dear Mrs Reed-</salute>
</opener>
<p>The weeks have<lb/>
been passing and still no let-<lb/>
ter to tell you that I miss you-<lb/>
Our frequent meeting and<lb/>
little chats were among the<lb/>
nice things that I associate with<lb/>
the Burlington-</p>
<p>I do hope that you and your<lb/>
daughter have been altogether<lb/>
well and that the winter has<lb/>
been an enjoyable one.</p>
<p>It had been our hope that<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03254002"/>
we would have long enough at<lb/>
Christmas time for at least a<lb/>
glimpse of our Burlington friends,<lb/>
but my husband had to hurry<lb/>
back to Trenton and our fam<lb/>
ily claimed what time we<lb/>
had in Washington. It was<lb/>
most exasperating to run into<lb/>
the hotel with some trunk<lb/>
checks and not have time to<lb/>
see you.</p>
<p>Of course it has been ex-<lb/>
ceedingly nice to be in Tren-<lb/>
ton and so near Harl that we<lb/>
have been able to see him us-<lb/>
ually once or twice a week.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03254003"/>
The De Witt Clinton<lb/>
1686<lb/>
Opposite The State Capitol<lb/>
On The Park<lb/>
State And Eagle Streets<lb/>
Albany, New York<lb/>
He has been having an interest<lb/>
ing year and of course we<lb/>
have enjoyed it with him.</p>
<p>I went to Detroit two weeks<lb/>
ago with my husband and<lb/>
really saw the city for the first<lb/>
time tho I had been thru it be-<lb/>
fore. It has some huge and<lb/>
<add>some</add> unusually fine buildings but<lb/>
what I most enjoyed was<lb/>
visiting Greenfield Village<lb/>
where Mr Ford seems <add>to be</add> bringing<lb/>
back to life the quaint old<lb/>
place with its facinating build-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f03254004"/>
ings and rare collection of old<lb/>
things- The village is by no<lb/>
means completed but never<lb/>
theless there is much in it<lb/>
to charm and surely displays<lb/>
a wonderful appreciation upon<lb/>
the part of Mr Ford for the per<lb/>
iods he is bringing back.</p>
<p>He is not forgetting <unclear>trees</unclear> to<lb/>
complete the landscape and<lb/>
an old stone fence adds much<lb/>
to the beauty- The whole project<lb/>
is a beautiful idea and is<lb/>
being beautifully accomplished.</p>
<p>A party was given where<lb/>
the Ford old time orchestra<lb/>
played for the old time dances-<lb/>
They were lovely to watch - Square<lb/>

Albany, New York<lb/>
dances (called off!) besides<lb/>
the waltz, polka and schotish-<lb/>
You will know what they were!<lb/>
So much prettier than the<lb/>
modern dances. and the dancers<lb/>
seem to have such good times.</p>
<p>We went back to Trenton for a<lb/>
few days and came up here<lb/>
last Tuesday when we expect<lb/>
to stay for another week.</p>
<p>If you know Albany, you will<lb/>
remember that its State St. is<lb/>
built on a steep hill so that<lb/>
<unclear>we</unclear> must go into &ldquo;second&rdquo;<lb/>
walking either up or down, then<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f03254006"/>
when you cross the street you<lb/>
must tip to one side <unclear>or</unclear> the <unclear>other</unclear>.<lb/>
By the time I am ready to<lb/>
learn the city I expect to be more<lb/>
or less athletic!</p>
<p>At this hotel we have a maid<lb/>
(about sixty, I'd say!) who al-<lb/>
most made me lose my<lb/>
self respect yesterday when<lb/>
she told me of an experience<lb/>
she had losing her glass eye-<lb/>
You see she was in church<lb/>
and she knew she was going<lb/>
to sneeze and naturally that<lb/>
of the dire consequences, so<lb/>
she grabbed for her eye but<lb/>
alas! too late! It simply broke<lb/>
into <unclear>smitherines</unclear>- I'm being<lb/>

Albany, New York<lb/>
haunted by that glass eye<unclear>!</unclear><lb/>
But -- I'm writing words<lb/>
I fear-</p>
<p>I would like to be re-<lb/>
membered to my Burlington friends<lb/>
and to your daughter specially-<lb/>
Please don't forget me- It<lb/>
has been a delight to know<lb/>
you and I'm hoping that<lb/>
our paths will cross again-<lb/>
Can you forget how slow I<lb/>
have been and write to me?<lb/>
My friends tell me that<lb/>
I am a better friend than<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f03254008"/>
I am a correspondant. but<lb/>
I am always making good<lb/>
resolves and I'm sure the<lb/>
trouble is not that I do not<lb/>
think often of my friends.</p>
<p>This <unclear>carriers love</unclear> to you and<lb/>
a real desire to see you-</p>
