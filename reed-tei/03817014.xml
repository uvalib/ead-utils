<salute>My dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Many thanks for your letters of June seventh and June ninth. It<lb/>
was a real shock to learn that dear old Kissinger had suffered a stroke<lb/>
two days after the memorable meeting in Cleveland. June and I were<lb/>
thrilled to meet him. He seemed such a simple, genuine and lovable<lb/>
character. Under the circumstances, it will probably be impossible to<lb/>
get an autographed photograph of him. If, as we all hope, he does re-<lb/>
cover I wish you would keep it in mind. Even though we should succeed<lb/>
in getting his picture I would like to have a print of the photograph<lb/>
of you, Mr. Cornwell, Miss Blossom Reed, and Mr. Kissinger, in front<lb/>
of Mr. Cornwell's painting.</p>
<p>I will, of course, send a note to Mrs. Kissinger, telling of our<lb/>
enjoyment in meeting him and of our hope for his recovery.</p>
<p>I enclose a cutting from the Dayton Herald of June fifth. Appar-<lb/>
ently, this went to newspapers all over the country over the wirephoto.</p>
<p>I saw Paul Hoeber just after we left the luncheon. He was greatly<lb/>
interested in the talk you gave at the unveiling ceremony. He indicated<lb/>
that he was eager to have it for the Annals of Medical History. He took<lb/>
a copy of your address with him. That evening I had dinner with Morris<lb/>
Fishbein. I told Morris about your talk and he stated at once: &ldquo;I must<lb/>
have the manuscript for Hygeia. It is just the kind of story for lay<lb/>
people.&rdquo; I told Morris that I would pass the word to you. It occurs<lb/>
to me that a condensation of the paper would be ideal for publication<lb/>
in Hygeia, rather than in the Annals of Medical History. I leave the<lb/>
matter to your good judgment. I do not feel that such a condensation<lb/>
would conflict in the least with the publication of a monograph. It is<lb/>
a thrilling story and you have treated it with just the right touch. I<lb/>
do not know of any story in the whole realm of medical history to compare<lb/>
do not know of any story in the whole realm of medical history to compare<lb/>
with it.</p>
<p>June and I are more than ever in your debt for your thoughtfulness<lb/>
in inviting us to attend the luncheon as your guests.</p>
<p>June joins me in sending affectionate greetings from House to House.</p>
