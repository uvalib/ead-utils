ON YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>IS SEARCHING OLD RECORDS</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>To Gather Facts Concerning Con-<lb/>
vention Held Here Years Ago, at<lb/>
Which Two Physicians Declared<lb/>
That Yellow Fever Was Not<lb/>
Contagious, But Was Infected<lb/>
Through Some Other Means--He<lb/>
Searches The American Files.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Dr. William T. Jenkins at one time<lb/>
health commissioner of New York city<lb/>
and also health officer of that port, was<lb/>
in the city yesterday searching for rec-<lb/>
ords of the Second National Sanitary<lb/>
Convention, which was held in Baltimore<lb/>
in 1858. Dr. William Miller Kemp was<lb/>
commissioner of health in Baltimore at<lb/>
that time. He advanced a theory at that<lb/>
congress that yellow fever was not con-<lb/>
tagious. A resolution to that effect was<lb/>
also offered by Dr. A. H. Stevens of<lb/>
New York.</p>
<p>From observations these doctors had<lb/>
found that yellow fever was not trans-<lb/>
mitted by contagion, and a search was<lb/>
then started to discover in what manner<lb/>
the disease was spread. Their theory<lb/>
was proven correct in 1899 by Dr. Wal-<lb/>
ter Reed, of the United States Army.<lb/>
who, with a party of doctors, went to<lb/>
Cuba to make a study of yellow fever.<lb/>
It was at that time the startling discov-<lb/>
[line missing]<lb/>
sponsible for the transmission of yellow<lb/>
fever. Dr. Jenkins will publish a book<lb/>
in which he will give Drs. Kemp and<lb/>
Stevens credit for being the first men<lb/>
to advance the theory that yellow fever<lb/>
was not contagious. Dr. Jenkins spent<lb/>
yesterday morning going through old<lb/>
files of The American.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been four National Sani-<lb/>
tary Conventions held in the United<lb/>
States,&rdquo; said Dr. Jenkins. &ldquo;The first<lb/>
was held in Philadelphia in 1857: the<lb/>
second in Baltimore in 1858: the third in<lb/>
New York in 1859, and the fourth in<lb/>
Boston in 1860. At these conventions<lb/>
many important questions were discussed.<lb/>
It was not known at that time that yel-<lb/>
low fever was transmitted by the mos-<lb/>
quito. Dr. A. H. Stevens, a noted phy-<lb/>
sician of New York and one of the au-<lb/>
thorities on sanitation in the United<lb/>
States, offered a resolution at the con-<lb/>
vention in Baltimore in 1858, in which he<lb/>
advocated the theory that yellow fever<lb/>
was not contagious. Dr. William Miller<lb/>
Kemp, who was the commissioner of<lb/>
health in Baltimore at the time, was<lb/>
also a strong believer in Dr. Stevens'<lb/>
theory. They did not know then that<lb/>
it was the mosquito that carried the<lb/>
dreaded disease. But from scientific ob-<lb/>
servations they were positive that there<lb/>
were other means than contagion for<lb/>
spreading the disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To prove this theory Dr. Kemp was<lb/>
present when a ship was unloaded in<lb/>
Baltimore that came from an infected<lb/>
port. Some of the workmen who unloaded<lb/>
the ship contracted yellow fever. That<lb/>
ship must have brought mosquitoes from<lb/>
the infected port, and they transmitted<lb/>
the disease to the workmen. Dr. Kemp<lb/>
did not know at that time that the mos-<lb/>
quito was responsible for the transmission<lb/>
of the disease, but he was positive that<lb/>
there were no infected persons aboard<lb/>
that ship and that the workmen con-<lb/>
tracted the disease through some means<lb/>
that had not been discovered by the<lb/>
medical profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Jenkins thinks that the men who<lb/>
first advanced the theory should have<lb/>
credit for what they did, as well as the<lb/>
men who afterward proved their theories<lb/>
correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the fourth convention met in<lb/>
Boston in 1860,&rdquo; continued Dr. Jenkins,<lb/>
&ldquo;no means had been discovered by which<lb/>
ships could be disinfected. Steam was<lb/>
afterward [fo]und to be the means that<lb/>
had lon[g][word missing] sought by the scientific<lb/>
[w]orld. [words missing] Harris, of New York,<lb/>
[line missing]<lb/>
[words missing] of the convention<lb/>
[words missing] 1860. At the same time<lb/>
[words missing] perfecting the use of steam<lb/>
[words missing] purposes. I am writing a<lb/>
book in which it is my intention to<lb/>
give credit to such American doctors as<lb/>
Dr. William Miller Kemp. of Baltimore;<lb/>
Dr. R. H. Stevens, of New York, who<lb/>
first advocated the theory that yellow<lb/>
fever was not contagious, and to Dr.<lb/>
Elisha Harris, of New York, who intro-<lb/>
duced steam as a means of disinfecting<lb/>
ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. William T. Jenkins was born at<lb/>
Holly Springs, Mass., October 25, 1855,><lb/>
and was graduated from University of<lb/>
Mississippi in 1878. He took a post-grad-<lb/>
uate course at the New York University<lb/>
in 1880, was appointed director of the<lb/>
Merchant Marine Hospital Service for<lb/>
Foreign Sailors in New York: health<lb/>
commissioner of New York and officer<lb/>
of the port, 1892 to 1894. He was coro-<lb/>
ner's physician, 1881 to 1892. He is a<lb/>
member of the County Medical Society<lb/>
and Medical Association of New York.</p>
<p>While officer of the port of New York<lb/>
Dr. Jenkins had charge of the Cholera<lb/>
Hospital during the epidemic a number<lb/>
of years ago.</p>
