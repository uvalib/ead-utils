<p>Lopez states that his father leased land from Ignacio Rojas and that he himself lived in the structure identified as Camp Lazear Building No. 1 by Moran. He describes some of the structural features as unusual for Cuban buildings and states that Building No. 2 was torn down in 1927.</p>

Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
Mayo Clinic,<lb/>
Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
c/o Mr. John J. Moran.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Agreeable to your request, transmitted to me through Mr.<lb/>

Moran, in connection with a wooden building on the &ldquo;Finca San Jos&eacute;&rdquo;,<lb/>
Marianao, formerly the property of Dr. Ignacio Rojas and his family,<lb/>
I wish to make the following statements:</p>
<p>In March, 1907, my father leased the limekilns and lime-<lb/>
stone quarry from Dr. Ignacio Rojas. Close by were two small build-<lb/>
ings (wooden), the use and occupancy of which were included in the<lb/>
lease. My father took up residence in one of the two buildings and<lb/>
had a partition built in it, converting it into two rooms. Later on,<lb/>
he built another small room against one end of it and a kitchen<lb/>
against the rear of the building, running its entire length, a fraction<lb/>
over six (6) meters. I lived in this house continuously from March<lb/>
1907 until 1936. I got married in 1920, my wife and myself continuing<lb/>
to live in the building referred to. My father died in 1935. All<lb/>
three of my children were born in this building, which Mr. Moran calls<lb/>
&ldquo;Building No. 1&rdquo;, presumably having known of the building when it was<lb/>
constructed in 1900, when I was only seven years old. This building<lb/>
is an unusual one for Cuba, in more than one particular. <hi>First</hi>: The<lb/>
double board wall, with tongued and grooved lumber on the inside and<lb/>
weather boarding on the outside. <hi>Second</hi>: The ceiling, which does not<lb/>
extend all the way up, whereas, in the customary Cuban construction, it<lb/>
would run all the way up, although, more than likely, it might not have<lb/>
any ceiling at all. <hi>Third</hi>: It has a stovepipe hole in one corner,<lb/>
rarely, if ever, to be found in wooden buildings in Cuba. Since I<lb/>
first lived in the house, I have never seen a stove there, as we do<lb/>
not use stoves for heating in Cuba, due to the fact that we rarely, if<lb/>
ever, have cold weather. What Mr. Moran refers to as &ldquo;Building No.<lb/>
2&rdquo; was partly toppled over during the 1926 cyclone and torn down about<lb/>
a year later. I pointed out to Mr. Moran where it stood. The one in<lb/>
which I lived, we had to reinforce and it managed to withstand the<lb/>
effects of the cyclone. I do not know who lived in either of the<lb/>
two buildings between October, 1901 and March, 1907.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute>

I CERTIFY that this letter was<lb/>
read by me to Sr. Zunzunegui,<lb/>
translated into Spanish, before<lb/>
he signed it:<lb/>
Federico Oliveros. <lb/>
