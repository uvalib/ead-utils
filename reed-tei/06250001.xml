Colonel J. R. Kean,<lb/>
Hdqrs. 1st Corps Area,<lb/>
Army Base,<lb/>
Boston 9, Massachusetts.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was very glad to get your letter of<lb/>
September 19th with reference to Colonel Binnie. He had a<lb/>
cerebral hemorrhage in July, 1921. I imagine that he is not<lb/>
well fixed financially and so became a Veterans' Bureau case.<lb/>
He was at the Army and Navy Hospital at Hot Springs for six<lb/>
months and then, on account of the hot weather, was transferred<lb/>
to the Letterman in July, 1922. He has been a patient here<lb/>
since that time with the exception of about three months last<lb/>
winter when he was transferred to the Navy Hospital at San<lb/>
Diego, California. His disability at present consists of the<lb/>
loss of use of his right arm, complete amnesia for reading, and<lb/>
almost complete amnesia for speech. His general physical con-<lb/>
dition is excellent. He walks well and is up and about all the<lb/>
time. On account of his difficulty in speaking he is, I think,<lb/>
quite sensitive about seeing his old friends. He can say<lb/>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; but is rarely able to say more than two or three<lb/>
words without considerable confusion.</p>
<p>Mrs. Binnie is in San Francisco and takes<lb/>
him out for a ride in their automobile every day.</p>
<p>We have given Colonel Binnie one of our best<lb/>
rooms in the officers' ward and have done everything possible to<lb/>
make him happy and contented. He likes the Letterman Hospital<lb/>
better than any place he has found up to this time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truby and I called on Colonel and Mrs.<lb/>
Canby who are now stationed here. They told us that you and Mrs.<lb/>
Kean were contemplating another trip to Europe. I wish that we<lb/>
could all go with you again. Our trip to Europe together in 1921<lb/>
represents one of our happiest experiences. My girls are always<lb/>
San Francisco (GH) 11-22-22--14M<lb/>

2. Colonel Kean<lb/>
September 26, 1923.<lb/>
referring to it and I am sure we would like to repeat it. However,<lb/>
as I will be due for foreign service within a few months, our path<lb/>
will probably be across the Pacific instead of the Atlantic. I<lb/>
would greatly prefer service in Panama to the Philippines as it<lb/>
would simplify the schooling problem for the girls, for there is<lb/>
nothing in the Philippines in the way of high schools which they<lb/>
could attend. Elizabeth will be ready for Vassar next year and<lb/>
Barbara is in the second year of high school. I mentioned this to<lb/>
General Ireland when he was here but up to this time he has not in-<lb/>
formed me whether I am to go to Panama or to the Philippines. If<lb/>
you decide to go to Europe and then continue your travels around the<lb/>
globe you will probably find us either in Manila or in Panama and<lb/>
we would be delighted to have you stay with us.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truby and the girls join me in very best wishes<lb/>
for you and Mrs. Kean.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
