Senora Estella Rodriguez-Leon<lb/>
15 Street No. 311<lb/>
Vedado, Havana<lb/>
Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Senora Rodriguez-Leon:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I plan to return to Havana the last two weeks in March and<lb/>
sincerely hope that I will be able to visit you again. By separate post,<lb/>
I am sending you a <hi>brochure</hi> which was just published, and which included<lb/>
my Washington and Jefferson talk with quotations from you. I have<lb/>
collected quite a lot of data concerning the yellow fever experiments, so<lb/>
much so that I have been urged by several interested parties to publish<lb/>
a monograph thereon. I am therefore most anxious to obtain further help<lb/>
from you when I visit you. I believe that for the sake of your father's<lb/>
memory you will wish to give me this help because unfortunately, I have found<lb/>
certain persons in this country who rather belittle your father's contri-<lb/>
bution toward the work. A perusal of your father's papers has convinced me<lb/>
that he did much more work than he was given credit for, but I need proof<lb/>
in the form of such letters and papers, and perhaps diary, that you may<lb/>
possess. Do you think it would be at all possible for you to visit the<lb/>
house where much of your material is stored and to have it available for me<lb/>
to look over in March?</p>
<p>I realize that the time I spend in Havana may not be sufficient<lb/>
for me to study it carefully even with your help, but perhaps with your per-<lb/>
mission I can have some of it copied and some of it photostated. I can assure<lb/>
you my only thought is to give due credit to all concerned, most assuredly<lb/>
including your father, and before publishing anything about your father, I<lb/>
absolutely promise to submit it to you for your comments and criticism.</p>
<p>Enclosed please find the last photograph you so kindly loaned<lb/>
me. I have been trying to get it identified. I have sent it to General<lb/>
Truby who was commanding officer at the Post Hospital in 1900 and also to<lb/>
General Kean, whom you remember. Neither of these man can identify the loca-<lb/>
tion but I have had the photograph copied and will keep sending it to various<lb/>
survivors in the hope that somebody can identify it. Among other things, you<lb/>
remember I asked your permission to photostate the entire manuscript of your<lb/>
father's unpublished address. You only sent me one page to photostat. I re-<lb/>
turn it with my deepest thanks.</p>
<p>It will be indeed a pleasure to meet you and your good husband<lb/>
again and I promise not to bother you any more than your goodness will permit,<lb/>
but I know that you will want your father's share in the conquest of yellow<lb/>
fever properly presented.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
