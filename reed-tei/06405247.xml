MAYO CLINIC<lb/>

Mr. Gust Lambert<lb/>
8009 Avalon Avenue<lb/>
Chicago 19, <unclear>Illincis</unclear>.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Lambert:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I do apologize to you most sincerely for keeping your data so long.<lb/>
The delay was not entirely due to procrastination. I wanted to show some of<lb/>
your items to others--notably to General Kean and General Truby-- so that they<lb/>
could perhaps give you and me some help and information on certain debated<lb/>
points and I was postponing my reply to you until I could send you (with your<lb/>
data) what comments they might have.</p>
<p>You were here on June 20 and 21, 1946. That following week I went to<lb/>
San Francisco where I had a nice visit with General Truby. I showed him the<lb/>
papers you had leaned me, also a copy of our interview of June 21. He wanted me<lb/>
to leave it with him so that he could read it over at his leisure. I did and<lb/>
later I received the interview back with certain comments written thereon by<lb/>
General Truby.</p>
<p>Last month I had occasion to go to Washington, D. C. and spent a day<lb/>
with General Kean. As I promised you I would do I showed him also that copy of<lb/>
Special Order No. 83 (Quemados, November 14, 1900) and told him your opinion<lb/>
that that order in effect made Doctor Ames a member of the Yellow Fever Board<lb/>
replacing Lazear. Meanwhile I have had your items photostated here as you<lb/>
graciously permitted me to do and I am therefore returning herewith to you the<lb/>
following:</p>
<p>1) letter from Winifred Lewis - February 16, 1943</p>
<p>2) letter from Mattie Rogers</p>
<p>3) article about Miss Warner - &ldquo;A Modern Nightingale&rdquo;</p>
<p>4) photostat letters from Moran and from Wilson</p>
<p>5) copy of letter from R. K. Thomason to Doctor Brumby</p>
<p>6) article and resolution by Doctor Brumby</p>
<p>I have retained the photostat copy of S.O. 83 as I believe you said you had<lb/>
extra copies and were kind enough to say I could keep this one. <hi>If I am in error</hi>,<lb/>
I will have this one copied and return it to you at once.</p>
<p>Now let me transmit to you some of the comments of Generals Truby and<lb/>
Kean. I am sure they have considered your opinions with real understanding and<lb/>
sympathy but I will tell you to what extent their opinions differ from yours.</p>
<p>First with regard to Special Order No. 83. You will note that this<lb/>
order, dated at Quemados, November 14, 1900, is a Headquarters order of the<lb/>
Department of Western Cuba. It is not an order which originated in Washington<lb/>
from the War Department, or from the Surgeon General, or through the A.G.O. The<lb/>
order (paragraph 2) specifically states: &ldquo;Upon the recommendation of the Chief<lb/>
Surgeon&rdquo; (that was Major Kean, I believe) "Dr. Ames was to report for temporary<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06405248"/>
Mr. Gust Tawbert<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
December 27, 1946<lb/>
<hi>duty</hi> to Major Reed.</p>
<p>In the opinion of Generals Truby and Kean (given to me separately and<lb/>
independently of each other) this order did not make Doctor Ames a member of the<lb/>
Yellow Fever Board any more than did paragraph 1 of the same order make Forbes,<lb/>
Morris, and Kissinger members of the Yellow Fever Board. Just as paragraph 1<lb/>
temporarily assigned Forbes, Morris, and Kissinger to help Major Reed temporarily<lb/>
(at Camp Lazear) so paragraph 2 temporarily assigned Doctor Ames to help Reed. To<lb/>
have made Doctor Ames actually a member of &ldquo;A Board of Officers&rdquo; (the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Board) created by A.G.O. Special Order No. 122 par. 32-34, Washington, May 24, 1900,<lb/>
would have required an order originating in Washington (from the S.G.O. or A.G.O. or War<lb/>
Dept.) amending the original order creating the Board. No such order affecting<lb/>
Ames exists so far as anyone knows.</p>
<p>Kean and others in charge of local personnel in Quemados and at Camp<lb/>
Columbia could order certain of their personnel to serve temporarily with Reed.<lb/>
They had that authority. But nobody in Cuba had the authority to amend a War<lb/>
Department order creating a Special Board. Had Reed asked for an official replace-<lb/>
ment for Lazear he would have communicated to the Surgeon General a request for<lb/>
such an official replacement probably suggesting to the Surgeon General the name<lb/>
of the person he (Reed) would prefer. Actually Lazear was never officially replaced.<lb/>
We are all sure of that. I have spent days in Washington going over thousands of<lb/>
old items, orders, etc. I found no order replacing Lazear or concerning Ames and<lb/>
the Board.</p>
<p>I am entirely aware of the wonderful contribution Doctor Ames made to the<lb/>
work of the Board but I beleeve anyone who would try to get official proof that Ames<lb/>
became a member of the Board would be doomed to disappointment. Doctor Brumby may<lb/>
decide not to publish his paper with his opinion on this point until he checks the<lb/>
matter with Washington. This could be done quite simply, I believe. Records re-<lb/>
garding military personnel are kept in the A.G.O. and in the National Archives. I<lb/>
believe the A.G.O. would probably now only have an outline of Doctor Ames' record<lb/>
but the original papers, orders, etc. concerning Doctor Ames would have been trans-<lb/>
ferred to the National Archives, A.G.O. or S.G.O. Historical Division. Had Dr. Ames<lb/>
actually been made an official member of the Yellow Fever Board there would be<lb/>
evidence in the form of orders and records more impressive than that afforded by<lb/>
S. O. 83.</p>
<p>In the attempts of yourself and Doctor Brumby to obtain further honors<lb/>
and recognition for Doctor Ames would it not be more profitable to drop attempts<lb/>
to prove that he was a member of the Yellow Fever Board or to get him placed on<lb/>
the Yellow Fever Roll of Honor, etc. (which efforts have failed or will be doomed<lb/>
to failure, I am sure, as Mr. R. E. Thomason advised Doctor Brumby)? Would it not<lb/>
be better to honor Doctor Ames in other ways, for example, as I hope to do by<lb/>
articles based on the record and facts of his excellent help to Major Reed. I<lb/>
certainly plan to honor Doctor Ames in my book by showing his full provable part<lb/>
in the work. Doctor Brumby might want to start a movement to erect a memorial<lb/>
plaque to Doctor Ames in his medical school (or some more impressive honor).<lb/>
Doctor Brumby may wish to publish an article about Doctor Ames in his State Medi-<lb/>
cal Journal or some national journal. Perhaps the town where Doctor Ames was<lb/>
born would name a street in his honor, or a medical annex or dispensary. There<lb/>
are many ways to honor him--ways that would enlist generous support and not in--<lb/>
volve unhappy controversies. But any article about Doctor Ames should, of course,<lb/>
be carefully checked and rechecked so as to conform to the published<hi>official records</hi>.<lb/>
The story of Doctor Ames based on such sure grounds is stimulating enough to make<lb/>
his family and friends proud of it without &ldquo;spoiling&rdquo; it with controversial matter.<lb/>
I personally believe that the family and friends of Doctor Ames will be pleased, and<lb/>

Mr. Gust Tawbert<lb/>
-3-<lb/>
December 27, 1946<lb/>
I hope satisfied, by my book (whenever it gets published) and its part devoted<lb/>
to Doctor Ames. Incidentally, I intend to indicate also your own fine contri-<lb/>
bution in like manner.</p>
<p>Now let me discuss other points raised by our interview of June 21, '46.<lb/>
Please do not feel hurt by the following remarks. As you know the memories of<lb/>
all of us play curious tricks and we don't have to be very old to experience the<lb/>
results of a fallacious memory. I have been checking into the record and dates and<lb/>
I do think you are mistaken in your interpretation of the role you ascribe to<lb/>
General Kean. You seem to believe that he had it in for you and perhaps also for<lb/>
Doctor Ames. I am absolutely sure this is not so. I have spent many hours, indeed<lb/>
many days, during the past six years questioning General Kean on all phases of the<lb/>
Yellow Fever story. He has repeatedly told me of many, many details--of his illness,<lb/>
of Doctor Ames, of you, etc. At no time did he ever as much as infer anything but<lb/>
full and due respect for what Doctor Ames did, for what you did, etc.</p>
<p>You seem to believe that Major Kean had something to do with Doctor Ames'<lb/>
transfer to Pirotechnia and with your &ldquo;blank description blank.&rdquo; Two or three<lb/>
years ago General Kean was kind enough to lend me his diaries. I poured over them,<lb/>
checking dates, facts, etc. Among other things his diaries gave, of course, his own<lb/>
movements, transfers, etc. These records would indicate that when Doctor Ames was<lb/>
transferred and when you were also transferred (August, 1901) Major Kean had nothing<lb/>
whatever to do with it. He himself had already been transferred to other work.<lb/>
After November 15, 1900, he was no longer Chief Surgeon. For awhile he was on<lb/>
General Wood's Staff(after May, 1901) in charge of the Havana's city hospitals and<lb/>
charities. I am therefore absolutely sure of two things: 1) Major Kean had nothing<lb/>
to do directly or indirectly with these transfers; 2) there was no punitive motive<lb/>
of any sort in these(routine)changes.</p>
<p>Later in our interview you expressed the belief that when Ames asked<lb/>
permission of the Surgeon General's Office to borrow Cuban material &ldquo;Major General<lb/>
Kean, who was acting Surgeon General,&rdquo; refused unless Ames would put his request<lb/>
through channels. You stated that Ames &ldquo;was at that time a Major and Commanding<lb/>
Officer and refused to do this so he never got permission.&rdquo; Let me comment on this.<lb/>
Kean was never a Major General and was never Acting Surgeon General Ames. was never<lb/>
a commissioned officer so obviously he was never a Major and presumably never a<lb/>
Commanding Officer. If Doctor Ames didn't get the material he wanted simply because<lb/>
he refused (through hurt feelings or pride?) to repeat his request through regular<lb/>
channels (as practically every military person must do to this day) should one blame<lb/>
someone in Washington who suggested this? I think there is a misunderstanding about<lb/>
this whole episode.</p>
<p>I know you will be glad to have some of these misunderstandings done away<lb/>
with. I do so much hope that in your own feelings you can be much happier, freed of<lb/>
the feeling that you or Doctor Ames were discriminated against. From all I can hear<lb/>
and read both of you did your duty most admirably and only kind and generous words<lb/>
can be, or have been, said of you both. You should continue to have a deep satis-<lb/>
faction for what you did so well. I personally am very glad indeed to have had the<lb/>
privilege of meeting you, of talking to you, of hearing your story, of getting your<lb/>
valuable help. I will never forget it. It is probable that I will need more help<lb/>
from you and I do hope I can stop off in Chicago again soon. Your visit to Rochester<lb/>
in behalf of Doctor Ames' record shows your loyalty and devotion. In I whatever way I<lb/>
can help you or Doctor Brumby prepare a suitable tribute to him I would be so glad<lb/>
to help. Not only that, but I am sure both Generals Kean and Truby also would be<lb/>
glad to help Doctor Brumby.</p>

P. S. I am sending you a carbon copy of our interview of June 21, 1946<lb/>
with some hand-written corrections by me. I would appreciate it greatly<lb/>
if you would review this interview carefully and insert such changes or<lb/>
corrections as you see fit. Please take your time about this. Perhaps<lb/>
a friend could read it to you, which would save time and spare your eye-<lb/>
sight.<lb/>
In particular, would you review what you told me herein about<lb/>
the little yellow fever huts and who was treated in each one. What you<lb/>
told me on June 21st doesn't seem to agree with what is written in<lb/>
General Truby's book, which I believe you have and which I believe he<lb/>
prepared (that part of it) largely on information from you.<lb/>
Let me tell you again the criteria which were used by the<lb/>
Surgeon General's Office and Congress when, in 1929, they passed a bill<lb/>
giving pensions and medals to certain men who had been instrumental in<lb/>
the demonstration of the transmission of yellow fever. The list was pre-<lb/>
pared for a Committee of the House of Representatives by the Surgeon<lb/>
General of the Army after consulting with General Kean and several of his<lb/>
assistants. Walter Reed and the Members of his Board, the nine men who<lb/>
underwent the very repulsive fomites experiments and the American volunteers<lb/>
who suffered attacks of yellow fever from experiments with infected mos-<lb/>
quitoes and injections of blood were included on this list for medals<lb/>
and pensions. But it was realized that the various doctors and nurses<lb/>
who exposed themselves in the care of yellow fever patients in line of<lb/>
duty should not be included in the list however meritorious their services<lb/>
had been. The Surgeon General's reason was obvious--there would have<lb/>
been no limit to such a list.<lb/>
The object of the legislation was to reward those who actively<lb/>
participated in the experimental work. Those who cared for the sick or<lb/>
disinfected their clothes as a measure of routine sanitation were not<lb/>
included. As you, of course, know, these conditions set forth by the<lb/>
Surgeon'General's Office and approved by Congress excluded Doctor Ames<lb/>
and others who gave excellent service in line of duty. No applicant who<lb/>
was bitten but not infected was ever included, nor any man whose exposure<lb/>
was not governed by the strict limitations of quarantines and scientific<lb/>
controls.<lb/>
