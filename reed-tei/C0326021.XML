<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your much appreciated letter of March 21st. has just<lb/>
reached me.</p>
<p>It was good of you to take time to tell me about Dr. Wakeman,<lb/>
as I was, of course, extremely interested in the matter and much puz-<lb/>
zled by the newspaper reports of his illness and death. It is indeed<lb/>
unfortunate for any erroneous data to be published which may, as you<lb/>
say, make people consider the yellow fever campaign &ldquo;even more danger-<lb/>
ous to the personnel than it really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw Mrs. Frost, here in Washington, a couple of days ago and<lb/>
she said that Dr. Frost, or herself, would notify me just as soon as he<lb/>
had things cleared up for us to work together. No word as yet, but the<lb/>
week is not over and I am ready to leave whenever I do hear from him.<lb/>
In the interim, there are, of course, many things that can still be done<lb/>
over here; in the further simplification and elucidation of the biblio-<lb/>
graphic cards and in the search for the few references which are still<lb/>
eluding us. Miss Brown and I worked until 10.30 last night (intended to<lb/>
stop at 10, but &ldquo;got on the trail&rdquo; of one of the most exasperating of<lb/>
our unverified quotations (no author given) and--luckily--&ldquo;ran it to<lb/>
earth&rdquo; and made out its bibliographic card before we separated. On the<lb/>
other hand, she has been over 19 volumes of Walckenaer's ..&ldquo;voyages&rdquo;<lb/>
without finding a much-desired reference to &ldquo;Agra beads&rdquo; on the Cuinea<lb/>
Coast. Well, there are 21 vols. in the set, so we may get it yet--still<lb/>
&ldquo;two to go!&rdquo; I looked for it last spring, but didn't dare take too much<lb/>
time then as I had to verify essentials first.</p>
<p>Like yourself, I &ldquo;am looking forward in the near future to see-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0326022"/>
-2-<lb/>
see-<lb/>
ing the completed manuscript,&rdquo; and this with feelings which none can<lb/>
better appreciate than yourself, who know what the work meant to both Father<lb/>
and <add>myself</add> during his life and that its completion has been my one hope and<lb/>
occupation and preoccupation since his death. It is, as I wrote Dr.<lb/>
Frost, an unspeakable comfort to realize that, with his resumption of<lb/>
the final editing, the book, <hi>as Father wished it</hi>, should now soon be<lb/>
an accomplished fact.</p>
<p>With very best wishes to yourself and to Dr. and Mrs. Beeuwkes<lb/>
when next you see them, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>
