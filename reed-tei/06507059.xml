General Albert E. Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Avenue<lb/>
San Francisco, California<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been working desperately to finish some work before going to Europe. I have<lb/>
actually worked long hours every night for the last month, <unclear>honor</unclear> my delay in writing<lb/>
to thank you most sincerely for the most interesting survey which you made. You<lb/>
did a grand job with the problem. I leave today with Mary for a quick trip to Europe,<lb/>
speaking in Geneva on the 25th of August at the International Congress on Rheumatic<lb/>
Diseases and will be back, after a short vacation at <unclear>Lake Como</unclear>, the week of Septem-<lb/>
ber 27.</p>
<p>If you are in the mood to do so, I have another problem for you but this is not nearly<lb/>
so hard as the other one. I have been struck by the fact that I, an outsider, have<lb/>
been unable to get a complete picture of the personalities of the four members<lb/>
of the Yellow Fever Board. We know what they did; we know, up to a point, what<lb/>
they said, but what were they like? We have a picture of Reed as being a stern,<lb/>
disciplined, dignified character who could unbend on occasion and was quite<lb/>
friendly to his very close friends and even overly sentimental with his family,<lb/>
but there you have it in one sentence. We know that Carroll had apparently an<lb/>
inferiority complex, was shy, stubborn about his work, faithful to Reed, while he<lb/>
was working with him at least, and so on. I could continue but I think that between<lb/>
what you know about these men and what you put in your book there has been much lost.<lb/>
I am not even sure how tall Reed was or how much he weighed and the same goes for<lb/>
the others. Of course General Kean and others gave me a rather unfavorable opinion<lb/>
of Carroll in his later years but he must have been a useful individual in his own<lb/>
way in Cuba. I do not know how much of personality and physical appraisal should<lb/>
go into my book but it distresses me that I feel that my knowledge of them is in-<lb/>
complete.</p>
<p>Now my problem is this. Supposing I were the Surgeon General or the President<lb/>
(Heaven forbid!) and you were my trusted colleague and I wrote and asked you for a<lb/>
four-page memorandum on each man. What would you write me? Does this appeal to<lb/>
you? I hope it does. Don't worry about it. Don't start on it until you have thought<lb/>
it over and if it starts bubbling up in your mind and heart, then it will come out.<lb/>
I would certainly love to have your appraisal, not in an extensive, but in a con-<lb/>
fidential way, more than you or anyone else have given it.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Always yours,</salute>
