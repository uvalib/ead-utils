<p>FROM DR. HOWARD A, KELLY</p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p>WOULD HONOR DR. REED</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Dr. H. A. Kelly Speaks Of Discoverer<lb/>
Of Cause Of Yellow Fever.</p>
<p>Dr. Howard A. Kelly believes that Con-<lb/>
gress should provide a liberal pension for<lb/>
the widow of Dr. Walter Reed, who dis-<lb/>
covered the cause of yellow fever. Dr.<lb/>
Kelly said yesterday to a reporter of THE<lb/>
SUN:</p>
<p>"As human nature is constituted there<lb/>
should always exist a certain reciprocal re-<lb/>
lation between those, on the one hand, who<lb/>
confer distinguished favors, and those who,<lb/>
as the recipients of such favors, have the<lb/>
opportunity of giving adequate expression<lb/>
to their gratitude and appreciation. It is<lb/>
one of the sad records of history, however,<lb/>
that the men who have conferred the great-<lb/>
est benefits upon their race have, in many<lb/>
instances, notably failed to receive their<lb/>
meed of appreciation from their benefici-<lb/>
aries. I think no one will quarrel with me<lb/>
when I insist that if the beneficiary is a<lb/>
person of wealth and unlimited resources,<lb/>
while the benefactor is poor, it becomes a<lb/>
matter of sad reflection on the character of<lb/>
the recipient should he leave the benefac-<lb/>
tor who has saved his life in actual want.</p>
<p>"I have made these reflections with the<lb/>
case of the late Dr. Walter Reed, distin-<lb/>
guished surgeon of the United States Army<lb/>
in mind. Dr. Reed solved the problem which<lb/>
has vexed generations of physicians at home<lb/>
and abroad; he discovered the cause of the<lb/>
terrible plague, yellow fever, which has de-<lb/>
vastated our country for generations, and<lb/>
simultaneously with the discovery of the<lb/>
cause he also demonstrated efficient means<lb/>
of prevention, so that this scourge of an-<lb/>
cient times is forever conquered and need<lb/>
never revisit our country claiming its thou-<lb/>
sands and tens of thousands of victims, as<lb/>
in the decades past. Traditions still exist,<lb/>
handed from mouth to mouth, of the awful<lb/>
epidemic in Philadelphia little over a cen-<lb/>
tury ago, and I have heard many times in<lb/>
my own family of the men who drove up<lb/>
and down the deserted streets with carts,<lb/>
crying out: &lsquo;Bring out your dead, bring<lb/>
out your dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>"From all this has Dr. Walter Reed saved<lb/>
our country. He has given us millions of<lb/>
lives in the generations to come and count-<lb/>
less millions of money. And now that an<lb/>
early death has snatched him away how<lb/>
can we show some slight expression of our<lb/>
gratitude for the services he has rendered<lb/>
us? What can the nation do to honor such<lb/>
a man and to encourage others to spend<lb/>
their lives in humane research? Surely the<lb/>
most fitting tribute we can pay such a mem-<lb/>
ory is to show our appreciation of the com-<lb/>
fort of her who was his closest companion,<lb/>
his wife. The least the nation can do is to<lb/>
devote a modicum of the enormous wealth<lb/>
he has spared us to her whom he would<lb/>
have loved most to honor had he lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the earnest hope of the medical pro-<lb/>
fession throughout the country that in ar-<lb/>
ranging a pension for Mrs. Walter Reed our<lb/>
representatives at Washington will show a<lb/>
clear appreciation as to the value of her<lb/>
husband's services by conferring an amount<lb/>
in some degree commensurate with the in-<lb/>
estimable benefits the nation has received<lb/>
at his hands.&rdquo;</p>
