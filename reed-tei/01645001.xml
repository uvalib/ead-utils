<salute>My pretty, little &ldquo;B.&rdquo;;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have dispatched,<lb/>
this morning, my regular Thursday's<lb/>
letter, and yet e're the day is spent,<lb/>
I find myself, with pen in hand,<lb/>
writing to my own, darling little<lb/>
sweetheart- I shan't send it, how-<lb/>
ever, before Monday next, as I well<lb/>
know, should you receive four<lb/>
letters in such rapid succession,<lb/>
that you would give up in blank<lb/>
despair. Hence, my little &ldquo;B.&rdquo;, I'll re-<lb/>
spect your feelings by detaining<lb/>
it- I may add something to it, to-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01645002"/>
morrow &amp; the next day- And then on<lb/>
Monday, I will bring it to a termination<lb/>
by adding a little more; so that in<lb/>
the end, it may assume very lengthy<lb/>
proportions &amp; consume much of your<lb/>
time in the reading of it. But whether<lb/>
it shall chance to be long or short,<lb/>
interesting or uninteresting, it will<lb/>
possess the recommendation (too<lb/>
often lacking in this world) of coming<lb/>
from a warm heart, a true heart;<lb/>
<add>of being</add> inspired by love as pure as an<lb/>
angel's &amp; as deep <add>&amp; abiding</add> as woman's,<lb/>
and penned by an honest &amp;<lb/>
willing hand- Besides, I am sure<lb/>
that it will be accorded a gra-<lb/>
cious &amp; warm welcome at the<lb/>
hands of the sweetest, dearest,<lb/>
most lovable woman on Earth;<lb/>
one who is dearer to me than<lb/>
mother or sister; who, though ab-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01645003"/>
sent, is still ever with me, &amp; who<lb/>
guides my steps with an in-<lb/>
fluence sweet &amp; gentle, yet<lb/>
even felt-! The impulse to write<lb/>
to you, to-night, my darling, is irre-<lb/>
sistible- Would you believe it,<lb/>
if I should tell you that I have<lb/>
been quite home-sick all the<lb/>
day long? Not a desire to be<lb/>
at home, in Harrisonburg, but<lb/>
at home, in <hi>Murfreesboro</hi>- Do<lb/>
you feel surprised that I <add>should</add><lb/>
call Murfreesboro &ldquo;<hi>my</hi> home&rdquo;?<lb/>
Why should you be? Is it not <hi>your</hi><lb/>
home, my darling, &amp; where your<lb/>
home is, there is mine also!<lb/>
Ah! dear, charming Murfreesboro,<lb/>
how I long for the shade of<lb/>
thy widespreading oaks, &amp; to walk<lb/>
thy quiet streets, away from<lb/>
care &amp; turmoil! What sweet<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01645004"/>
recollections flood my mind, tonight!<lb/>
Remembrances that are dear &amp; pre-<lb/>
cious to me above all that earth<lb/>
can give, &amp; which the world can<lb/>
never take away! Ah! Emilie,<lb/>
darling, I would give all that<lb/>
I possess in this world to spend<lb/>
one hour by your side, this<lb/>
evening, &amp; to hold your sweet hand<lb/>
in mine! I have never experienced<lb/>
the <hi>weight</hi> of separation so much<lb/>
as I have during the few weeks<lb/>
that <del>I</del> have elapsed since I saw<lb/>
you last. The hours seem length-<lb/>
ened to days, the days to weeks, &amp;<lb/>
the weeks to months. Did I not<lb/>
have your photograph to press<lb/>
to my heart, I should never be<lb/>
able to bear our separation-<lb/>
As I gaze at your dear face,<lb/>
I forget, for the moment, that it is<lb/>
not your real self, &amp; although the<lb/>
delusion quickly vanishes, yet while<lb/>
it lasts, it makes my heart beat light <add>&amp;</add> free.<lb/>

Friday- August, 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- Received an answer<lb/>
from Dr Torney, last evening, appoin-<lb/>
ting Tuesday, next, as the day for vis-<lb/>
iting the city- So that I impatiently<lb/>
await the arrival of that day- Ah!<lb/>
how my heart will rebound with<lb/>
joy when the day arrives for my<lb/>
visit to Murfreesboro-! when I shall<lb/>
meet, face to face, my darling little<lb/>
&ldquo;B.,&rdquo; &amp; grasp her little hand! What<lb/>
if anything should occur to inter-<lb/>
rupt my going? Such, for instance,<lb/>
as being ordered to the far West<lb/>
before that time arrives- Away<lb/>
with such a thought! I'll har-<lb/>
bor none such. &ldquo;Uncle Sam&rdquo;<lb/>
couldn't be so hard-hearted as<lb/>
to order a poor fellow away<lb/>

without giving him a chance<lb/>
to see his Sweet-heart- He is<lb/>
too good natured an old man<lb/>
to do such an act- At least,<lb/>
we'll hope so. Would it sur-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01645006"/>
prise you to <del>tell you</del> <add>be told</add> that I have<lb/>
been wearing <hi>crape</hi> for seve-<lb/>
ral days past? An order was<lb/>
issued, on the occas<del>s</del>ion of the<lb/>
death of Ex-Prest. Andrew Johnson,<lb/>
that all officers of the Army should<lb/>
wear crape for a period of<lb/>
30 days, as a mark of respect;<lb/>
which will account for my wea-<lb/>
ring it. It recalls vividly to<lb/>
my mind the last and only time<lb/>
that I ever wore crape. (Heaven<lb/>
grant that the time may be far<lb/>
distant when I shall again<lb/>
put it on!) It was when my<lb/>
poor, suffering mother died-<lb/>
well might I wear some em-<lb/>
blem of grief for such a<lb/>
mother-! Sweet, gentle Soul!<lb/>
Hadst thy summons not come so<lb/>
soon, perhaps thy son had<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01645007"/>
been, to-day, a better boy! Dear,<lb/>
sainted spirit! Mayst thou ever<lb/>
hover near me; so shall I<lb/>
be kept from all temptation!<lb/>
You, my darling E., were too young<lb/>
to know her- Had you known her,<lb/>
'twould have been but to love<lb/>
her. Though you do not remember<lb/>
her, yet will you not mingle<lb/>
one tear with mine over her<lb/>
silent tomb? Ah! Yes, I know<lb/>
you will. Thus remembered,<lb/>
dear Mother, sleep! and when<lb/>
at last, thou shalt stand be-<lb/>
fore thy Maker's Throne, oh!<lb/>
may <hi>I</hi> too be there! one hand<lb/>
in thine; the other clasping<lb/>
my darling Emilie's!</p>
<p>Pardon me, my sweet E., for in-<lb/>
dulging in so sad a strain.<lb/>
I should, perhaps, have re-<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01645008"/>
strained my thoughts; and yet I<lb/>
could not. Attribute them to<lb/>
the affection with which I yet,<lb/>
and ever shall, remembered my<lb/>
sainted mother.</p>
<p>Monday - 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> - Saturday added nothing<lb/>
to my letter, &amp; of <add>course</add> Sunday, ditto- I would<lb/>
have written a few lines on Saturday,<lb/>
(although I have considerable objec-<lb/>
tion to keeping a <hi>diary</hi>) but as Dr<lb/>
B. went to the city &amp; left me in<lb/>
charge, I had to have an eye more<lb/>
particularly to professional<lb/>
duties- As luck would have it,<lb/>
I was kept quite busy during<lb/>
the day. First, a child in con-<lb/>
vulsions, &amp; then a girl with a<lb/>
scalp-wound &amp; c, &amp; c.-But I'll<lb/>
not impose upon your good<lb/>
nature by narrating such<lb/>
harrowing accidents, although<lb/>
I believe you have all the<lb/>
qualities necessary, if not<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01645009"/>
for a Surgeon, at least for<lb/>
a <hi>Surgeon's wife</hi>! As regards<lb/>
my religious exercises on Sun-<lb/>
day, all that I can do, is to<lb/>
read my Bible or some re-<lb/>
ligious-work- It's true there<lb/>
is a chapel at the post, &amp; a<lb/>
very nice one, but, at present,<lb/>
there is only a Catholic Ser-<lb/>
vice in the Morning, &amp; I doubt<lb/>
if my attendance would ben-<lb/>
efit my spirituality, in the least.<lb/>
The nearest protestant church<lb/>
is at Whitestone, two miles<lb/>
away -- a little too far to walk<lb/>
while the weather continues<lb/>
so warm &amp; the musquitoes so<lb/>
prevalent. Don't think that<lb/>
I will neglect my devotions,<lb/>
however.- If for no other rea-<lb/>
son, for <hi>your</hi> sake, my<lb/>
darling, I will try to lead<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01645010"/>
an exemplary life. By the way,<lb/>
have I told you about my<lb/>
French studies? I believe I<lb/>
have- I must confess that my<lb/>
progress is not very brilliant,<lb/>
though I am by no means, dis-<lb/>
couraged. The grammar I have<lb/>
is one which I obtained<lb/>
from the Post Library &amp; is not<lb/>
a good one, I think- It is<lb/>
Bolmar's Levisac's French Gram-<lb/>
mar. Did you ever see it? I think<lb/>
you told me, that you had stu-<lb/>
died De Vere's- I know the<lb/>
old gentleman pretty well<lb/>
&amp; believe that I will get his<lb/>
grammar. I do not find the<lb/>
pronunciation as difficult as<lb/>
I had anticipated- Still, if I<lb/>
had a good teacher, such as<lb/>
yourself, I'm sure I would<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01645011"/>
progress more rapidly. The as-<lb/>
cent to knowledge is ever<lb/>
difficult &amp; I shan't complain-<lb/>
I have been, also, reading what<lb/>
is called &ldquo;light, literature-&rdquo;<lb/>
First came &ldquo;The Woman in<lb/>
White,&rdquo; by Wilkie Collins.<lb/>
I presume you have read it-<lb/>
It was a very vividly drawn<lb/>
&amp; thrilling story, &amp; I was highly<lb/>
entertained with its perusal.<lb/>
It was certainly more interes-<lb/>
ting than &ldquo;The Wooing <unclear>O'it</unclear>,&rdquo;<lb/>
which is such a general<lb/>
favourite in Murfreesboro.<lb/>
Next, I read &ldquo;St. Roman's Well,&rdquo;<lb/>
by Scott. I must confess<lb/>
that I was not as much<lb/>
pleased as I had hoped to<lb/>
be. It certainly does not<lb/>
equal other of his works<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01645012"/>
which I have had the pleasure<lb/>
of reading. In fact one cannot<lb/>
help <del>from</del> feeling sad &amp; dis-<lb/>
tressed from the beginning to<lb/>
the finish, &amp; such sensations<lb/>
are, to me, not agreeable-<lb/>
I derive no pleasure from<lb/>
seeing a poor, injured mortal,<lb/>
spend all his <add>or her</add> days in sorrow,<lb/>
&amp; at last die wretchedly.<lb/>
However dark the Heavens may<lb/>
be, one golden ray in the far<lb/>
west brings some comfort-;<lb/>
one star inspires <add>some</add> hope.</p>
<p>But I will bring this disconnec-<lb/>
ted letter to a close-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, my darling,<lb/>
as ever, your<lb/>
affectionate &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
