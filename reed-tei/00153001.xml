<salute>My dear Mother:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your letter<lb/>
written at Bedford soon after I had written<lb/>
my last letter to you. I am glad to<lb/>
hear that you feel an improvement<lb/>
and I hope it will continue. I<lb/>
am sure that the water with the<lb/>
change and surroundings generally<lb/>
will do you much good. I received<lb/>
by the same mail the &ldquo;Bulletin&rdquo; and<lb/>
the &ldquo;Bedford&rdquo; paper.</p>
<p>I have been going on with my<lb/>
sightseeing here. On <del>Friday</del> Saturday<lb/>
I went to the Louvre, to the Jardin des<lb/>
Plantes, and <del>I</del> to the place where the<lb/>
Gobelin Tapestry is made. The Gobelin<lb/>
Tapestry is beautiful, the coloring is<lb/>
wonderful. The Jardin des Plantes is not<lb/>
to be compared to the Kew Gardens nor is<lb/>
the Menagerie to the one in London.<lb/>
In the evening I went to the Theatre Francoise<lb/>
and saw &ldquo;Francois de Champi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Les<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00153002"/>
Petit Oiseaux&rdquo;, Coquelin (cadet) playing<lb/>
in the latter. They have a splendid<lb/>
company. The theatre is very fine<lb/>
but not as magnificent as the opera.<lb/>
They are both supported by the Government.<lb/>
Yesterday (Sunday) I went to the Louvre<lb/>
and in the evening I went up to<lb/>
the top of the Eiffel Tower. I went up<lb/>
about seven o'clock just at Sunset.<lb/>
It was clear and the view was<lb/>
excellent. They keep the Galleries, Museums etc. open on Sunday here<lb/>
in order to give the people a chance to<lb/>
see them, and then they close them<lb/>
on Monday to give the attendants<lb/>
a rest. It seems to me to be a<lb/>
very good plan.</p>
<p>The Boulevards here are magnificent,<lb/>
great broad streets, broad sidewalks<lb/>
with rows of trees. Then strings of<lb/>
little tables in front of the cafes<lb/>
with people sitting and drinking.<lb/>
Here everybody drinks openly and yet<lb/>
there is no drunkenness. Beer is<lb/>
the usual drink and they drink it<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00153003"/>
slowly and they never take too much.<lb/>
You occasionally see people drinking<lb/>
Absinthe but it is not as common<lb/>
as I had supposed. There is also<lb/>
a great deal of coffee drunk in<lb/>
front of the cafes. I always take<lb/>
my coffee in that way after dinner.</p>
<p>August 12.</p>
<p>I received your letter this morning<lb/>
which you wrote at Cumberland. I am<lb/>
sorry you did not make a longer stay<lb/>
at Bedford. I supposed that you would<lb/>
stay there three weeks at least. You<lb/>
should have stayed until the worst of<lb/>
the hot weather was over.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went with Norris and Knapp<lb/>
to the Medical School and we spent<lb/>
most of the afternoon in the Museum<lb/>
which is very fine. We then went<lb/>
to the Morgue and to the cathedral<lb/>
of Notre-Dame which is near there.<lb/>
In the evening we went to the<lb/>
&ldquo;Bouffes Parisiens&rdquo; where they were<lb/>
playing a pantomime called &ldquo;L'Enfant<lb/>
Prodigue&rdquo; (Prodigal Son). It was very<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00153004"/>
good indeed although the theatre is<lb/>
a very small affair. Today I have<lb/>
been at the Musee de Luxembourg<lb/>
looking at the modern paintings<lb/>
and sculpture. There are a great<lb/>
many excellent things there including<lb/>
Marie Bashkirtseff's &ldquo;Meeting&rdquo;. I<lb/>
afterwards went to the &ldquo;Bon Marche&rdquo;<lb/>
which disappointed me. This<lb/>
sightseeing is a very tiresome<lb/>
business and I will be glad when<lb/>
it is over. Norris and I will leave<lb/>
Paris about Friday and go to the<lb/>
Rhine probably first to Heidelburg<lb/>
and then take a walk. We will<lb/>
not make any very decided plan<lb/>
but we will wander down the<lb/>
River. I will write to Baring's from<lb/>
time to time where to send my<lb/>
letters. We will certainly sail<lb/>
on Sept. 6. I have given up all<lb/>
hope of getting a berth for the<lb/>
13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. I will try to get off two letters<lb/>
a week but it is not probable that<lb/>
they will reach you regularly so<lb/>
you must not be worried.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00153005"/>
You must take good care of<lb/>
yourself while you are in Pittsburgh.<lb/>
I think you will get along<lb/>
better now that you are at<lb/>
Uncle Tom's.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
