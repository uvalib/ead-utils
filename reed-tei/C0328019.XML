<p>Carter believes Frost's name should be included on the title page of the published version of the History of Yellow Fever. Due to Frost's hard work, Carter believes that Henry Rose Carter would be proud of the book.</p>

<salute>Dear Jack:</salute>
</opener>
<p>1: Since you stated, in your letter of June 14th., that you were in no<lb/>
h<del>y</del><add>u</add>rry about the data as to the correct version of the word <hi>Cocoliztle</hi> (Mem:<lb/>
note final <hi>e</hi> as well as <hi>z-t-l</hi>), I have put off writing about the matter in<lb/>
the hope of being able, at the same time, to satisfactorily settle the two<lb/>
refs. <add><hi>re</hi> <unclear>cleichemecs</unclear></add> to the <hi>Anales de Chimalpahin (1889)</hi> and to the <hi>Codex of Ixtlilxochitl</hi><lb/>
(<unclear>CM</unclear>. Section iii, part i, p. 12 (f. n.) Saw the Chief of the Department of<lb/>
<unclear>Ethnology</unclear> at the Smithsonian yesterday and the thing is as much <add>&ldquo;</add>in the air<add>&rdquo;</add> as<lb/>
ever. Details later, but I think that there must be some error in the dates<lb/>
as given in our MS.</p>
<p>To return to the Cocoliztle (Sec. iii, p. i. pp. 36-7, etc. etc.):</p>
<p>There are only two complete Spanish editions of Herrera at the Library<lb/>
of Congress, and only in these complete editions is found the famous para-<lb/>
graph, which Fathere quotes verbatim (from the 1726-27 edition) on pp. 36-7<lb/>
of his MS. In both of the above edit<del>o</del><add>i</add><del>n</del><add>o</add>ns the word is spelled &ldquo;<hi>Cocoliztle</hi>:&rdquo;</p>
<p>(a) Herrera y Tordesillas, Antonio de</p>
<p>Historia general...1726-27. Dec. iv (not LV, this was evidently<lb/>
a typographical error) lib. lx, cap. viii, p. 188.</p>
<p>(b) Ibid...1601-15. Dec. iv.lib. ix, cap. viii, p. 236. (Mem. It is<lb/>
to this latter edition that Augustin refers when he states (1909) p. 74:<lb/>
&ldquo;Cocolitzle, Herrera in his famous work published in 1601, says that name<lb/>
was given by the Carib Indians to the disease.<add>&rdquo;</add> (Mem. note incorrect spelling<lb/>
of the wor<del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del><add>k</add> in question in quoting from the 1601 ed. of Herrera).</p>
<p><del>ii</del><add>2)</add>: I shall be grateful if, since you have finished with Colin Chis-<lb/>
ho<del>m</del><add>l</add>m, you will send it back to me by registered mail as soon as practicable.<lb/>
I have already had to renew the book and am liable to be called on to re-<lb/>
turn it to the Library at any time.</p>
<p>3): <hi>Re</hi> the title page of Father's book, I quite agree with you that<lb/>
it should not be cluttered up with the names of too many people, no matter<lb/>
how much they may have contributed to the preparation of the book. I do con-<lb/>
sider it fitting, however, as I wrote you before, that your name should appear<lb/>
with that of Father. No one, save yourself, could have gotten the book into<lb/>
the shape in which he would have wished it to appear, and this, together<lb/>
with your understanding and appreciation of him both as a man and a scientist,<lb/>
will, I feel assured, do more to give him his rightful place in Medical His-<lb/>
tory than everything else put together. This fact has long been my greatest<lb/>
solace. However, as you say, we can talk this over later.</p>
<p>With love to the Susans and continued gratitude to yours<del>l</del><add>e</add>lf,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
