<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here I am neglecting to write you a letter of sympathy<lb/>
for your illness until I want some information from you! But I think<lb/>
you will be more interested in the subject that in any sort of<lb/>
commiseration. But I am heartily glad to hear that you are on the road to<lb/>
recovery and maybe on the road to Washington too.</p>
<p>It is Chara again. This summer I have had an excellent opportunity<lb/>
of seeing the not-working of this antilarval agent. Rice plots in the<lb/>
rice Expt. Sta. here full of it all arranged for study. Of the species I am not<lb/>
yet informed. I have sent specimens to Dr. Robinson, the Chara authority, and<lb/>
also to the Bureau of Plant Industry, but no answer yet.</p>
<p>Larvae all stages over abundant Chara as elsewhere, even thicker<lb/>
where matted Chara protects against fish. Also breeding over Nitella<lb/>
another member of the same group of algae.</p>
<p>I did a lot of laboratory experiments to try to determine if<lb/>
this Chara could be effective there as Caballero states. In a cup with<lb/>
abundant Chara quad. will develop from egg to imago in 12 days, counting<lb/>
from the night of oviposition, and not very good weather for quadding either.<lb/>
Part of Chara rots and part remains living as shown by rotation of protoplasm<lb/>
in cells. Many cultures in several sorts of containers. Sometimes larvae<lb/>
die in Chara, but same happens with some Spirogyra cultures. Main thing<lb/>
is to have plenty of food. I should like to know what results Caballero<lb/>
would get in his &ldquo;crystalladores&rdquo; if he floated a cork on the surface of the<lb/>
water and put a little rotten Chara or Spirogyra on it. Sometimes scums<lb/>
interfere, but doubtful if more often with Chara than with any other alga.<lb/>
Dried and powdered Chara a fair food, crushed green Chara a good food<add>(</add><del>)</del> or<lb/>
source of food, for other organisms come it to supplement) and crushed<lb/>
spores of Chara also nourishing, or at least not poisonous.</p>
<p>I thought it worth while to get out a short paper, although<lb/>
the dog may be dead anyway. I am trying to get together the literature<lb/>
and applied to the Hyg. Laboratory. They kindly sent me photostats of<lb/>
Caballero's originals and I have Vasconcelos' aticle, but the Hyg. Library<lb/>
could not get me the things I wished much, the Report Proc. Antimal.<lb/>
Advisory Comm. Palestine, 6th Meeting, the reference you so kindly gave me.<lb/>
There is a copy in the Surg. Gen. Library, but Mr. M otter wrote me that<lb/>
this copy would not be ready for distribution until next fall or winter.<lb/>
Now do you know where I could get the loan of some other copy? I will<lb/>
cross my heart and promise to return it within a week or less.</p>
<p>All going well here. We are trying to get at the amount of malaria in<lb/>
this rice country. Plenty of Anopheles, but it is remarkable how much<lb/>
thicker they are about Stuttgart. Dr. Fricks visited region around Stuttugart<lb/>
this month so that we could get a comparison during the same time.</p>
