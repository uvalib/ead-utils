Mr. John J. Moran<lb/>
c/o Cia. Sunoco de Cuba, S.A.<lb/>
Avenida Menocal No. 102-A<lb/>
Havana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Moran:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You have a right to chide me for not being a prompt correspondent,<lb/>
but my associate has been away, leaving an extra burden of work on me.</p>
<p>First of all, let me thank you very kindly indeed for your valued<lb/>
publications concerning the yellow fever experiments. I am returning by separate<lb/>
post, The Popular Science Monthy article and the Roll of Honor. I was able to<lb/>
get copies of these two. So far I have not been able to get a copy of the<lb/>
Military Surgeon, and I am asking to keep this some weeks longer.</p>
<p>I shall take the liberty some time of writing Mr. J. H. Andrus and<lb/>
Mr. James L. Hanberry. I had planned to collaborate with you and Mr. Kissinger<lb/>
and write up your experiences under your names some time this year, of course<lb/>
submitting the manuscripts long ahead of time for your entire perusal, correction<lb/>
and approval, but I have been so busy that I have been unable to do much on it<lb/>
yet. Now that you and Mr. Kissinger both tell me that the published stories<lb/>
are not entirely correct, I want to take plenty of time to do this so that we<lb/>
may have an entirely correct story, omitting such parts that you and Mr. Kissinger<lb/>
think should not be published. My original plan is unchanged--to have each of<lb/>
you write your own story, to be published separately in a medical historical<lb/>
journal under your own names, with the right of republication in non-medical<lb/>
journals to be in your hands, and to be published as you see fit.</p>
<p>Now as to the personal questions which you ask about: I spoke to<lb/>
Dr. Crenshaw about you some time ago and showed him your letter. He is very much<lb/>
interested to know where you are. At first he was a little hazy on your<lb/>
identity, since he remembers three Morans. He was at the University of Virginia,<lb/>
academic, 1901-02, medical, 1902-06. He is one of our most valued members of<lb/>
the staff here. He says that he is going to write you shortly. You can reach<lb/>
him simply by addressing him at the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>In regard to your own difficulties: I wish indeed that I could be<lb/>
of some assistance to you by mail. We have a special department here for the<lb/>
care and treatment of patients with stomach and duodenal diseases, and I dis-<lb/>
cussed your letter with one of my colleagues in that department. You will<lb/>
appreciate that there are so many factors involved in the treatment of duodenal<lb/>
ulcer that it is impossible for me to give you any advice by mail, although<lb/>
I should like to be of any possible service to you. We have many patients<lb/>
with your condition who come here, and other things being all right, our<lb/>

Mr. John J. Moran<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>
January 27, 1938<lb/>
surgeons do not hesitate to operate upon a man of sixty-two whose general<lb/>
condition is satisfactory, and often a great deal can be accomplished.<lb/>
Other than surgery, you know the medical management of such conditions<lb/>
usually involves the avoidance of excesses of tobacco and alcohol, a fairly<lb/>
strict diet, and the use of certain alkaline powders and feedings between<lb/>
meals. Should you see fit to come to the Clinic for a thorough examination<lb/>
I shall be delighted to expedite your examination, and would personally see<lb/>
to it that the expense of the whole thing be kept down to the absolute<lb/>
minimum. I personally wish that I could promise you that your examinations<lb/>
would be gratis, but this is not within my province. Nevertheless, I can<lb/>
assure you that any general expense involved in the trip here would be<lb/>
entirely within your means and to your entire satisfaction.</p>
<p>Now regarding Mr. Andrus: I hesitate to inject myself into an<lb/>
argument between two groups of physicians, with Mr. Andrus' son on the one<lb/>
side and the physicians of the Walter Reed Hospital on the other. Nevertheless,<lb/>
I should like to be of service in any way possible and it so happens that I<lb/>
am in charge of the work on arthritis here. If, as Mr. Andrus' son feels,<lb/>
he has arthritis, I should be glad to cooperate with Dr. Andrus in any way<lb/>
possible. May I suggest that it might be more diplomatic if you would write<lb/>
to Mr. Andrus and suggest that his son write to me. Everything would then be<lb/>
in order and I should be glad to help in every way possible. If it were<lb/>
necessary or if it seemed expedient for him to be brought here, I should be<lb/>
glad to do all I could. There is not much to be done for syringomyelia,<lb/>
although there is an operation which is indicated in certain special cases.</p>
<p>If you do plan to come here, please let me know well ahead of time<lb/>
so that I can get everything set for you. I have to go to two medical con-<lb/>
ferences in England and will be away from the fourteenth of March to the nine-<lb/>
teenth of May. If you have any intentions of coming here perhaps it would be<lb/>
better to come either before or after these dates.</p>
