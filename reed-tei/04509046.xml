Dr. Pedro Nogueira<lb/>
Marti 219, Marianao<lb/>
Habana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Pedro:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I think you and your colleagues will be delighted that Jefferson Medical<lb/>
College, from which Carlos Finlay graduated, is actually sending a delegate to<lb/>
Cuba. He also wishes to lay a wreath in honor of Finlay and two or three other<lb/>
institutions have written me that they wish to participate. I will tell you<lb/>
about these on my arrival.</p>
<p>I hope you approve of my sending Jefferson Medical College and Doctor Tocantins<lb/>
one of the invitations you sent to me. You can give him a formal one on his<lb/>
arrival in Havana. I am sure he would like to receive from you or one of the<lb/>
committee a formal invitation on his arrival so that he is assured of a welcome.</p>
<p>Is the American Embassy participating in the affair? I am sure that they will<lb/>
want to. I think Mr. Willard L. Beaulac is the American Ambassador. I assume<lb/>
that you have invited him. I have just had a personal, unofficial letter from<lb/>
him saying that he would be pleased to give a reception at his house (American<lb/>
Embassy or home of the Ambassador?) for any distinguished guests from America and<lb/>
for certain Cubans. I gather that he would be delighted to participate in the<lb/>
ceremony at Camp Lazear and as I know that you were planning to invite him, I<lb/>
assume of course that he has already received an invitation. Perhaps Doctor<lb/>
Saladrigas, you or one of your associates might call Mr. Beaulac. If a recep-<lb/>
tion is to be given, he will have to make plans immediately.</p>
<p>I understand that the American Medical Association wishes to have a representa-<lb/>
tive at the ceremony and I believe General Streit will lay a wreath in honor of<lb/>
Finlay for the Surgeon General and one in honor of Reed for the Walter Reed<lb/>
Memorial Association. If it seems appropriate to lay one of these wreaths on<lb/>
Finlay's grave rather than at Camp Lazear, we can arrange that.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
