<salute>My darling, little Sweetheart;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I had<lb/>
hoped to announce to you, in this<lb/>
epistle, that the ring had been<lb/>
forwarded, but, as yet, I have<lb/>
not heard from Dr Torney, and<lb/>
hence have not been to the city.<lb/>
If I do not get a letter from<lb/>
him, tomorrow, I shall go to<lb/>
town &amp; select a ring without<lb/>
his assistance, although I<lb/>
think that his taste would<lb/>
yield a better result than<lb/>
mine- I am aware that no<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01644002"/>
particular haste is required in<lb/>
the matter; yet I dislike any<lb/>
unnecessary delay. I blame my-<lb/>
self for neglecting to take the<lb/>
measure of your finger while<lb/>
I was in Murfreesboro, in-<lb/>
stead of trusting simply to my<lb/>
judgement as to the required<lb/>
size. If I had entertained the<lb/>
thought that my appointment<lb/>
would have been delayed as<lb/>
long as it was, I should have<lb/>
attended to the matter long<lb/>
since- I merely say this, in<lb/>
order that you may not think<lb/>
that I have been, at all, in-<lb/>
different.</p>
<p>You expressed the desire, in<lb/>
your last letter, that I should<lb/>
abandon my habit of writing<lb/>
on Sunday- It was not, at<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01644003"/>
all, necessary that you should<lb/>
add that it would please you<lb/>
better. Your wish, my own dar-<lb/>
ling, would have been all-suf-<lb/>
ficient with me. To comply<lb/>
with your requests is my great-<lb/>
est delight- I thank my Maker<lb/>
that I am betrothed to a lady<lb/>
who has such an elavated<lb/>
idea of the sacredness of the<lb/>
Sabbath. To know that you<lb/>
are striving to live the life<lb/>
of a Christian brings me much<lb/>
happiness; and nothing could<lb/>
so influence me to walk<lb/>
justly before God &amp; man (a-<lb/>
side from the consciousness of the<lb/>
debt which I owe to Heaven)<lb/>
as the knowledge that it would<lb/>
meet with <hi>your</hi> wishes. Ah!<lb/>
Emilie, darling, you do not<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01644004"/>
know what an influence you pos-<lb/>
sess over my thoughts &amp; actions.<lb/>
You would scarcely believe<lb/>
me, did I reveal to you the<lb/>
extent of that influence. Oh!<lb/>
the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>woman's</hi> influence<lb/>
when the heart of man is brought<lb/>
into subjection <hi>through love</hi>!<lb/>
Her frown prostrates him in<lb/>
the dust-; her smile lifts him<lb/>
to Heaven! Ah! tell me of the<lb/>
brilliant accomplishments of<lb/>
<hi>man</hi>, &amp; I will tell you of a<lb/>
<hi>heart enchained</hi>! Tell me of<lb/>
an effort that knows no relax-<lb/>
ation, by day or night, and I will<lb/>
tell you of the power of woman's<lb/>
influence- She can degrade<lb/>
him to the level of a brute;<lb/>
She can elevate him to the<lb/>
position of a god! How care-<lb/>
ful should she be in the use of<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01644005"/>
of this great influence!</p>
<p>Yes, my darling, since you re-<lb/>
quest it, I will no longer write<lb/>
on Sunday, but on Monday; and<lb/>
if need be, I will devote <hi>all the<lb/>
day</hi> to my letter, since no one<lb/>
has so just a claim on<lb/>
my time as <hi>your sweet self</hi>-<lb/>
Do you know, my precious E., that<lb/>
I have been much distressed<lb/>
in mind, since I received your<lb/>
last letter? Since its reception,<lb/>
not one moment have you<lb/>
been absent from my thoughts.<lb/>
That anything should have<lb/>
occurred to grieve you, or to<lb/>
cause you to distrust human<lb/>
nature, gives me much pain.<lb/>
Believe me, nothing but the<lb/>
exigency of circumstances<lb/>
prevents me from being at<lb/>
your side, to offer myself<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01644006"/>
as a willing mark for all<lb/>
the darts that may be cast<lb/>
at you. Ah! my darling, no<lb/>
sigh escapes from your breast<lb/>
but moves a responsive chord<lb/>
in my heart! Why should<lb/>
you feel aught of sorrow, my<lb/>
dear E., &amp; <hi>I</hi> not be present to<lb/>
share it with you! when I had<lb/>
rather <hi>weep with you</hi> than<lb/>
rejoice with the Kings of<lb/>
Earth! Oh! that the day may<lb/>
soon come when I will be<lb/>
given the <hi>right</hi> to be a par-<lb/>
taker of your griefs &amp; joys;<lb/>
when I may press you to<lb/>
my heart &amp; with mine own<lb/>
hands wipe away your<lb/>
tears! Did I say &ldquo;tears&rdquo;! no,<lb/>
No, my sweet, there'll be no<lb/>
tears then! &ldquo;we'll live &amp; love<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01644007"/>
<hi>so true</hi>, the sigh that rends<lb/>
thy constant heart, will break<del>s</del><lb/>
thy&rdquo; Walter's &ldquo;too&rdquo;!</p>
<p>You say, &ldquo;would that I could<lb/>
tell you all; but no, I <hi>cannot</hi>.<lb/>
Sometime in the future, it may<lb/>
be revealed.&rdquo; Why can you not<lb/>
tell me? Can't you trust me, my<lb/>
darling? I <hi>know you can</hi>. Will<lb/>
you not tell me whether I am<lb/>
interested, personally, in your<lb/>
trouble? I may have miscon-<lb/>
trued your words. If I have, no<lb/>
harm has been done, &amp; it has<lb/>
given me an opportunity<lb/>
to proffer you my heartfelt<lb/>
sympathy. Will you permit<lb/>
me to offer a supposition as<lb/>
to the cause of your <add>recent</add> unhappi-<lb/>
ness? Remember that I offer <add>it</add> as<lb/>
the <hi>merest supposition</hi>- It may<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01644008"/>
cause you to laugh at my silly<lb/>
solicitude -- perhaps, it may not-<lb/>
It is, that some member of your<lb/>
family has taken a decided<lb/>
stand in opposition to our en-<lb/>
gagement- I know not what<lb/>
influence this might have with<lb/>
you, my darling; (&amp; yet I should never,<lb/>
for a moment, doubt you.)- With<lb/>
myself, it could have no possible<lb/>
influence- It is <hi>far too late</hi> for<lb/>
that! The time <hi>was</hi> when I would<lb/>
have listened to any objections,<lb/>
(&amp; it would have become me so<lb/>
to do.) but, at present, <hi>there is no<lb/>
power on earth that could cause<lb/>
me to change one &ldquo;jot or tittle&rdquo;</hi>!<lb/>
And though your whole family<lb/>
were arraigned against me, <hi>one<lb/>
&amp; all</hi>, it would <add>only</add> increase the<lb/>
devotion of your</p>
<closer>
<salute>fond &amp; affectionate</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>-
<seg>
P.S. Remember me very kindly<lb/>
to your sister, Mrs Harrold-<lb/>
W.<lb/>
Don't think that I believe that<lb/>
any one of your family is opposed<lb/>
to me. I merely offered the sup-<lb/>
position, for the purpose of<lb/>
expressing myself on the subject.<lb/>
