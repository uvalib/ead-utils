<salute>Dear Ma:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This letter will be a Phillippic against Eddy Champe<lb/>
Laura thinks a heap of him but he certainly is a good one to holler,<lb/>
His birth was <add>on</add> this wise he was born without any fire in the room &amp;<lb/>
with none of the usual dresses &amp; c ready &amp; seems to have taken that<lb/>
event in high dudgeon. His provisions were unusually slow<lb/>
in making their appearance &amp; he seemed to consider that personal &amp; was<lb/>
violent &amp; loud in his protests, but having everything he wants,<lb/>
he is quiet; but had the air of an injured person who has<lb/>
righted himself &amp; no thanks to anybody, He is rather over<lb/>
the average size &amp; with a big nose &amp; plenty of hair but short hair, He<lb/>
<hi>had</hi> a very soft &amp; sweet voice Laura says, but it is checked now.<lb/>
His sister smiled at 4 days old, Eddy Champe smiled for the<lb/>
first time today- 9 1/2 days old- &amp; I think that was a &ldquo;risus Sardonic-<lb/>
us-&rdquo;, Dedie has been afraid of him, but is reconciled now, &amp;<lb/>
makes the world of him, rocking &amp; singing to him as to one of her<lb/>
dolls, She bore her separation from Laura beautifully, fortu-<lb/>
nately L. was well enough to have her with her when ever she<lb/>
cried. She is so gentle in all her ways that she would never hurt any<lb/>

one, She just lay by her mother &amp; be quiet. I wish you could see her<lb/>
She has been sick - sore throat but is better now, her bowels are not in good<lb/>
condition either &amp; have not been since the Wooping cough exactly as I could<lb/>
wish them,</p>
<p>Murray's furlough is up the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> inst. whether he will leave straight<lb/>
to Memphis or go to Washington 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> I dont know: soon after that time<lb/>
I probably will go - where I don't know. Laura will be well enough if<lb/>
she improves as she has done. She had no fever &amp; no pain or any trouble afterwards<lb/>
I kept her quiet rather more than she wanted to but it is safer, she will<lb/>
not get up till Sunday - the 12<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> day of E. Champe's existence.<lb/>
I had a very busy time last month - a great deal of official &amp; professional work as<lb/>
well as the anxiety &amp; care of Dedie, all evening &amp; night, <unclear> ane</unclear>,<lb/>
I think February will be lighter in every respect,</p>
<p>For ear ache - if it comes from a catarrhal inflammation of the middle ear as<lb/>
in 19 cases out of 20,- <unclear>Leaching</unclear> the &ldquo;Tragers&rdquo; i.e. the gristle in <hi>front</hi> of the<lb/>
ear - is the most certain &amp; quickest. Ive seen it act like magic.<lb/>
Next, best is dropping <hi>hot</hi> <add>water</add> (as hot as can he borne) in the ear 10 or 20<lb/>
times &amp; is <hi>very</hi> good. Frequently Calomel gr 1/2 every hour for 3 or 4 doses<lb/>
Dovers powder gr <del>11 1/2</del>111<lb/>
will stop it, but not quick like the<lb/>
others. In my experience Opiates in any form have less power over<lb/>
earache than over most other pains, I wish we were together as<lb/>
badly as you do</p>
<p>I will answer Chas letter Sunday<lb/>
Tell Mary to write again.</p>

Laura says Eddy's things were all ready, but that I did not know<lb/>
where they were<lb/>
