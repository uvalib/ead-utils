<salute>Dear General Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am very sorry that my reprints did not reach<lb/>
you. My secretary sent them to Lima, thinking that you were still<lb/>
in Peru. She mailed another set to you in Washington as soon as<lb/>
your letter came.</p>
<p>I was happy to hear from you and appreciate your<lb/>
letting me see the copy of your painstaking analysis of my article.<lb/>
I was not satisfied with the article as it appeared. I did not want<lb/>
to publish it alone, and Lyster was to be joint author in it, but he was<lb/>
at work in the field much of the time and wrote me on the eve of his<lb/>
expedition into Mexico in the spring that he thought it better for me to<lb/>
write a brief summary of the results, which he would follow with detailed<lb/>
clinical reports by himself and others who actually used the vaccine and<lb/>
serum in the field. It seemed to be time to publish something of the<lb/>
results. Guiteras, immediately on return from West Africa in January<lb/>
of this year, when he could hardly have had time to learn anything of<lb/>
what had been done in the way of vaccination and treatment, wrote an<lb/>
article criticising my work and incidentally mentioning that there was<lb/>
no proof that the serum and vaccine was of any value. Finally, on the<lb/>
advice of Dr. Flexner, I wrote the brief resum&eacute; of the data I had,<lb/>
purposely leaving details for discussion in a more comprehensive report.</p>
<p>Your comment regarding my view of the incubation<lb/>
period in yellow fever seems to be based on a misunderstanding. My<lb/>
statement was as follows: &ldquo;Since the longest incubation period in<lb/>
yellow fever in man...is 12 days and the average from 3 to 6 days, the<lb/>
group of vaccinated individuals...who contracted yellow fever within<lb/>
from 1 to 10 days after vaccination must be excluded from a considera-<lb/>
tion of the protective effect of the vaccination&rdquo;. I did not ascribe<lb/>
the failure of protection to the length of the incubation period in yellow<lb/>
fever, but to the fact that immunity produced by vaccination is incom-<lb/>
plete until about 10 days after vaccination. I mentioned the French<lb/>
finding of 12 days merely as a possibility, but my stress of course falls on<lb/>
the average of 3 to 6 days, as anyone must necessarily base his opinion<lb/>
on the average and not on the extremes. If my English was not clear to<lb/>
you, my intention was to deal with the average. I quoted the average<lb/>
without mentioning sources, as the article was of general nature, but<lb/>
anyone who is interested in yellow fever knows so well your work in the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00916030"/>
-2-<lb/>
General Carter. Nov. 15, 1921<lb/>
accurate determination of the incubation period.</p>
<p>On page 13 I have underscored my discussion as to the use of<lb/>
other anti-yellow-fever measures than that of vaccination.</p>
<p>Vaccination was in all these instances carried out for the<lb/>
express purpose of comparison, and conditions were made as nearly similar<lb/>
as possible for vaccinated and unvaccinated. In Tuxpan, for example,<lb/>
no particular section of the town was set aside and vaccinated, but those<lb/>
persons who were living in the neighborhood of yellow fever foci and were<lb/>
most liable to be exposed to the infection were taken, or those who,<lb/>
being nonimmune, applied for vaccination because of fear of exposure.<lb/>
Perhaps I should have made this clear in my article. I just mentioned<lb/>
that the comparison was made under similar conditions. In Salvador,<lb/>
also, persons in the infected areas were vaccinated, and this is stated<lb/>
on page 11. I believe that it is not unusual that certain sections of<lb/>
a large town are more affected in yellow fever epidemics than others,<lb/>
according to living conditions and geographic distribution of cases,<lb/>
but I think this situation was not a factor in Tuxpan.</p>
<p>The clinical data regarding the effect of the anti-icteroides<lb/>
serum upon the condition of the patients were left out of this summary.<lb/>
The individual reports, however, refer to abrupt amelioration of symptoms<lb/>
after serum treatment, and many who have used the serum have stated<lb/>
enthusiastically that a remarkable improvement in general condition has<lb/>
followed the injections.</p>
<p>If you have any further comments or suggestions, I should be<lb/>
very grateful if you will write me again.</p>
<p>With warm regards and best wishes, I am</p>

<salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute>
