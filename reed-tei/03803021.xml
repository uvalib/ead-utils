Refer to File No. 314.7-1551<lb/>
Mr. Harry L. Freer, Chief Clerk<lb/>
Office of the Chief of Engineers, U. S. Army<lb/>
War Department<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Freer:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have received the maps referred to in your letter of February 20, the map of<lb/>
Columbia Barracks made in 1907 and the key to the numbered buildings, also two copies of<lb/>
a map of Columbia Barracks Reservation made in 1902 under the direction of Capt. Chauncey<lb/>
B. Baker. I am indeed very grateful to you for sending them to me but I am most anxious<lb/>
to have <hi>the key to the numbered buildings in this 1902 map</hi> which is marked "Columbia<lb/>
Barracks G 10-02-2 Mil. Sta., Cuba with the figure 338 to the right of this designation.<lb/>
Will you kindly send me <hi>two copies</hi> of the key to this map?</p>
<p>Permit me to explain my request. I have been investigating the historical<lb/>
medical researches of Major Walter Reed and his colleagues who discovered the cause of<lb/>
yellow fever. Their work was done in 1900-1901 at Columbia Barracks. The Cuban govern-<lb/>
ment has purchased the land (shown in this 1902 map) just east of the Marianao railroad<lb/>
and plans to erect a large and expensive memorial on the approximate site of the little<lb/>
buildings numbered 113-120. I am most anxious to identify the various buildings in this<lb/>
1902 map, especially those numbered 89 to 114 inclusive, plus 143. At the request of His<lb/>
Excellency, Dr. Domingo Ramos, Minister of National Defense of the Cuban government I am<lb/>
sending him shortly a documented statement as to the proper identity of these buildings<lb/>
and of Camp Lazear. Since I must send this report within the next two weeks I would greatly<lb/>
appreciate receiving the keys to the 1902 map at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>Incidentally a model of the Columbia Barracks Post Hospital is at the Carlisle<lb/>
Barracks (Pennsylvania) but has not been set up properly as they did not know how the<lb/>
buildings were arranged. If you are willing to do so please send me an extra copy of the<lb/>
1902 map with <hi>key</hi> to the buildings and I will send it to Col. John M. Willis, Acting<lb/>
Commandant, Medical Field Service School, Carlisle Barracks, with whom I have had some<lb/>
correspondence, or perhaps you would prefer to send it to him directly. I know they would<lb/>
be glad to know the correct arrangement after all these forty years.</p>
<p>You say you were unable to find any maps of Camp Columbia as of 1900 or 1901;<lb/>
could they have been listed as Columbia Barracks rather than Camp Columbia. The reason I<lb/>
have been lead to believe that such a map existed is that I understand that a &ldquo;small<lb/>
property map&rdquo; and &ldquo;map of the Post&rdquo; are mentioned (but not reproduced) in the Annual Report<lb/>
of Chauncey B. Baker, Mayor Quartermaster U.S.V. Chief Quartermaster, Dept. of Cuba, <hi>report<lb/>
dated June 30, 1901</hi>. This report appears in the Annual Report of the Commanding General<lb/>
for 1901 (U. S. Adjutant General's office, Cuba Division). Unfortunately I have not been<lb/>
able to get these reports. But apparently a map of the Post at Camp Columbia was made<lb/>
prior to June 30, 1901.</p>
<p>Major Reed, in Nov. 1900, erected a special experimental camp, named <hi>Camp Lazear</hi><lb/>
on the San Jose Farm, Quemados, one mile from Camp Columbia. Here the final experiments<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03803022"/>
Mr. Harry L. Freer<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>
February 24, 1941<lb/>
to determine the cause of yellow fever were done. Have you any record of any<lb/>
maps of <hi>Camp Lazear?</hi> I would certainly appreciate knowing this.</p>
<p>Will you permit me to enclose a copy of an address I recently made con-<lb/>
cerning the above? It will explain my interest in all this and will, I believe,<lb/>
interest you. I am indeed grateful for your generous help and will be very happy<lb/>
to find, at last, the key identifying the buildings at Camp Columbia as of 1902<lb/>
(or earlier).</p>

<salute>Very sincerely,</salute>
