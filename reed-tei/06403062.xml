<salute>My dear Col Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Mrs Kean asked me at breakfast<lb/>
this morning if I had written to you<lb/>
and I replied No, but I am going to do<lb/>
so today- When the postman came an<lb/>
hour later he brought me your letter<lb/>
with the photos of Reeds New Years Eve<lb/>
letter which I am glad to have-</p>
<p>As to the group with the Army ambulance<lb/>
I cannot identify it. I do not think it<lb/>
could have been taken at Camp Lazear<lb/>
From the establishment of the camp Reed was<lb/>
careful not to have any non-immunes<lb/>
come around and no small boys would<lb/>
have been allowed there mingling with<lb/>
the patients- I think that the picture may<lb/>

2<lb/>
have a souvenir of Reed's first visit<lb/>
to Cuba in May 1899 when he spent<lb/>
a week down in the Island at Puerto<lb/>
Principe- Truby in his book mentions it<lb/>
in connection with his account of the case<lb/>
of Patrick Smith which Wasdin insisted<lb/>
was yellow fever altho. he saw the autopsy<lb/>
with the Peyer's patches and other classical evi-<lb/>
dences of typhoid - pp. 40 &amp; 41. In your P. S.<lb/>
your stenog make you speak of a Sibley <hi>stone</hi><lb/>
in the little building No.2 at Camp Lazear. I<lb/>
think that quite probably they may have<lb/>
had a Sibley <hi>stove</hi>, and they were light, handy<lb/>
<add>little</add> cone shaped affairs used especially in connec-<lb/>
tion with the Sibley tents and every quarter-<lb/>
master had them in stock- They had<lb/>
no bottom but the ground and a door<lb/>
thru which the small sticks of wood were<lb/>
<unclear>fed</unclear> to them- The small <unclear>stove</unclear> pipe went out<lb/>

at the apex of the conical Sibley tent with a<lb/>
provision to protect the canvas-</p>
<p>Did Sra Raquel Romero of Havana come<lb/>
to see you in July? She is an artist who<lb/>
had a contract to paint a mural for<lb/>
a lecture room at the Military Hospital<lb/>
at Marianao and had selected as her<lb/>
subject the infection of mosquitoes by<lb/>
Lazear and then the infection of the Amer-<lb/>
ican nurse Miss Maas who died of it<lb/>
in the experiments of Guiteras &amp; Gorgas-<lb/>
She was a very intelligent women who<lb/>
spoke English and brought me a letter<lb/>
of introduction from Dr Domingo Remos<lb/>
She wanted to meet Mr. Cornwell and you<lb/>
and had telegraphed to you at Rochester- I told<lb/>
her where you were &amp; she planned to go to<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06403065"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
Hot Springs on her way back to Havana<lb/>
She saw Cornwell I think and got kind<lb/>
advice from him- I hope she was able<lb/>
to get to see you- She was very earnest and<lb/>
energetic and had been to the Army<lb/>
Medical Library- The Cuban Embassy were<lb/>
helping her all they could-</p>
<p>I have been going over my old papers to<lb/>
pick out a few to be deposited somewhere<lb/>
when I die, an event which I have no<lb/>
right to think distant since I had<lb/>
my 84<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> birthday in June- No one of<lb/>
my ancestors, so far as I can learn, has<lb/>
ever stood off the grim Reaper that<lb/>
long and I want to save Mrs Kean the<lb/>
worry of having to make worrying decisions-<lb/>
She tells me that you once told her to bun-<lb/>
dle up and send to you any thing rela-<lb/>
ting to the Y. F. Episode. My only son is not<lb/>

a doctor and would have no use for<lb/>
all this correspondence- But I cannot see-<lb/>
that you would have use for it either as<lb/>
the main bulk consists of letters from you<lb/>
of which you have carbon copies with<lb/>
some from Truby- I have several nice<lb/>
letters from Andrus the year before he died<lb/>
I have also many photographs which you have<lb/>
sent me and you would not want duplicates.<lb/>
I cannot imagine that at any time in the<lb/>
future any man with your industry,<lb/>
energy and gift for research and for<lb/>
weighing and adjudicating facts will ever<lb/>
come along to repeat the wonderful study<lb/>
that you have made of the Y. F. Episode-<lb/>
I wish that I could hope to see the conclu-<lb/>
sions that you have arrived at put into<lb/>
print- You must not put off for too long<lb/>
the putting together of the bricks to build your edifice<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06403067"/>

I remember having exchanged some<lb/>
letters with Dr. Harvey Cushsing about<lb/>
his admirable Life of Sir W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Osler-<lb/>
I expressed regret that he could not<lb/>
get it all in one volume, as people<lb/>
just will not buy 2 volume biogra-<lb/>
phies- He wrote that he knew that<lb/>
was true, but that it would require<lb/>
another year of work to compress his<lb/>
material into one volume and he<lb/>
could not spare another year from<lb/>
the practice of his profession-</p>
<p>Some years after its publication however<lb/>
he found a gifted woman who did<lb/>
the job of compression into one volume<lb/>
very well- Have you any suggestions<lb/>
as to what I can do with my U S S?</p>
<p>I am praying that I may <add>live to</add> see a glorious<lb/>
ending to this great war in which<lb/>
the English speaking people are engaged<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06403068"/>
7<lb/>
and a peace such as Tennyson foresaw<lb/>
(in Locksley Hall)</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the war-drum throbbed no longer, and<lb/>
the battle flags were furl'd<lb/>
In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the<lb/>
World<lb/>
There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful<lb/>
realm in awe,<lb/>
And the kindly earth shall slumber, lap't<lb/>
in universal law&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we will not wait for that consumma-<lb/>
tion, for me to decide what to do with<lb/>
my accumulation of papers, My good<lb/>
friend Dr. Harry Clunous the Librarian of<lb/>
the Alderman Library at the Univ. Va.<lb/>
will give a home to some of my old books<lb/>
to which I am attached, but I hesitate to<lb/>
propose to make a dumping ground of his<lb/>
five institution- So come on now and advise<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06403069"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
8<lb/>
me what to do with my old papers<lb/>
By the way I found the letters of Wal-<lb/>
ter Reed that I was looking for-<lb/>
But they had nothing to do with the<lb/>
episode- One was at the beginning of<lb/>
the Spanish War when he was in the<lb/>
S. G. O. &amp; I wanted to get sent to the<lb/>
front- Another was when I was urging<lb/>
him to be a candidate to succeed<lb/>
Gen. Sternberg and the third was a<lb/>
very humorous account of the attitudes<lb/>
and claims of the various candidates<lb/>
This I destroyed as it would do no good<lb/>
to keep it and I am sure he did not<lb/>
intend that I should do so-</p>
<p>Col. Siler who sees the Reeds occa-<lb/>
sionally tells me that Blossom is now<lb/>
all right and Mrs Reed who is 88 is<lb/>
doing well- when you get time to write<lb/>
to me do not fail to give me the news of Mrs Hench and your<lb/>
mother &amp; of the children-</p>
