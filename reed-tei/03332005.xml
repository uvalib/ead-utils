Doctor S. S. Goldwater,<lb/>
Commissioner of Hospitals,<lb/>
Municipal Building,<lb/>
New York, N. Y.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Goldwater:</salute>
</opener>
<p>General Truby has told me of his visit to you last week and has asked<lb/>
me just to make a statement to you of my knowledge of his work in the Medical<lb/>
Corps of the Army. I am glad to do this because, during all of his career,<lb/>
General Truby has occupied a prominent place in the work of the Corps.</p>
<p>It is not well known but it is a fact that young Truby was a warm per-<lb/>
sonal friend of Walter Reed's. He was with him in Cuba when the experiments<lb/>
were being carried on that proved the method of transmission of yellow fever<lb/>
and when Lazear died Walter Reed wanted Truby to join the yellow fever board<lb/>
to take Lazear's place but conditions arose which made that impossible.</p>
<p>I have known General Truby intimately for years and know of his valuable<lb/>
service. At one time he was the Chief Health Officer of the Panama Canal<lb/>
Zone, which, as you know, is a most responsible position. He carried on his<lb/>
work down there in a creditable way. During the War he rendered splendid<lb/>
service as one of the General Inspectors in the Office of the Surgeon General.<lb/>
After the War he became the Chief Medical Officer of the Air Service and, with<lb/>
his rare talents for organization, accomplished a great deal in organizing<lb/>
and solidifying this new service in the Medical Corps. During my service as<lb/>
Surgeon General he commanded the Letterman General Hospital at San Francisco,<lb/>
Calif. His administration of this large hospital was everything that could<lb/>
be desired. He has a very clear insight into the management of hospitals and<lb/>
proved himself an expert as a builder. He was also the Chief Surgeon of the<lb/>
Philippine Division for a tour and Surgeon of the Corps Area at Governors<lb/>
Island, N. Y. In both places he proved his worth as an administrator.</p>
<p>General Truby's last service during the time I was Surgeon General was<lb/>
as my Executive Officer. I selected him because he had the confidence of the<lb/>
Corps and was known to be a man of rare judgment. Shortly after I retired,<lb/>
my successor had General Truby appointed a brigadier General and assigned to<lb/>
command the Army Medical Center in this district. I have watched his work<lb/>
out there with a great deal of admiration. He has brought the administration<lb/>
of that great center to a high degree of efficiency and has again proven him-<lb/>
self a master in construction and in beautifying the reservation.</p>
<p>General Truby is a gentleman of pleasing personality, thoroughly loyal<lb/>
and dependable. I have the deepest confidence that he would be a comfort to<lb/>
any one who could use his rare talents.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
