<title>Letter from Jefferson Randolph Kean to Philip Showalter Hench, November 14, 1949</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Kean informs Hench that Laura Wood was at the Library of Congress looking through her father's papers and was surprised to learn that there were no diaries for 1900 and 1901. Kean has told her that Hench is trying to determine whether her father or Gorgas initiated the war against the mosquitoes.</p>

<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> came<lb/>
this morning- How good of you it was<lb/>
to write us such a fine letter when<lb/>
you are overwhelmed with great<lb/>
affairs! General and Mrs M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Coy<lb/>
were here to a simple lunch on Friday<lb/>
11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> with Luicita Wood who hailed us<lb/>
as old friends and seemed deligh-<lb/>
ted to see us. I called her by her first<lb/>
name because as I told her, I was<lb/>
in Havana and remembered when<lb/>
she was born there and was on her<lb/>
fathers staff, as Gen M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Coy- Then a Lieut-<lb/>
was also- She told us that she had<lb/>
spent several days at the Cong. Library<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06501058"/>
2<lb/>
and was treated with much courtesy-<lb/>
To her amazement there were <hi>no</hi><lb/>
<hi>diaries for those two years 1900 and<lb/>
1901</hi>- Why this was she does not know-<lb/>
But there was a great mass of corres-<lb/>
pondence with many letters from<lb/>
distinguished persons- She has<lb/>
put in a blue pasteboard box every<lb/>
letter and paper which had refer-<lb/>
ence to Yellow Fever or which she<lb/>
thought would be of interest to you-<lb/>
I told her that your interest was<lb/>
very broad and took in many questions<lb/>
and she did not indicate that she<lb/>
had any desire to limit your inves-<lb/>
tigation- I told her that I thought, for<lb/>
one thing, you wanted to know whether<lb/>
Gen. Wood initiated the warfare<lb/>
against mosquitoes or whether it came<lb/>
from Gorgas- I knew that Gen. Wood<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06501059"/>
3-<lb/>
accepted Reed's confirmation of the<lb/>
Finlay theory that Y. F. was mosquito born<lb/>
and that Gorgas told me in Jan. 1901<lb/>
that he believed that Reed has succeed-<lb/>
ed in transferring the disease in that<lb/>
way but he did not believe that<lb/>
it was the only way- or even <hi>the usual<lb/>
way</hi>- Gen. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Coy agrees with me that<lb/>
Gen. Wood directed the mosquito warfare<lb/>
in Havana and Major Gorgas / as he was<lb/>
then was the man to carry it out, being<lb/>
Health Officer of the City, (but not of the<lb/>
Province of Havana)- made a good job-<lb/>
well Luicita has become so interested<lb/>
that she says she is coming down to<lb/>
live in Washington near the Library<lb/>
and will spend her days there on<lb/>
her father's records- She has a good<lb/>
color and is looking I think very well.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06501057"/>
She talks well and does not look like<lb/>
an invalid, tho. she has a compan-<lb/>
ion who is also a nurse, I think,<lb/>
when she needs it-</p>
<p>I am much pleased to know that your<lb/>
brother is living in Pavilion 9- I<lb/>
know it well and in the garden<lb/>
behind it is one of the three great<lb/>
trees at the University - a great and<lb/>
perfectly symmetrical hickory tree-<lb/>
At this season its leaves are a<lb/>
perfect bright yellow and it is a<lb/>
glorious sight- The others are a great<lb/>
Walmet tree on maurve Hill and a<lb/>
great oak in the lawn of the President<lb/>
House across the Railroad C. &amp; O.<lb/>
I am delighted to know of your good<lb/>
health- But learn to say <hi>no</hi> to these<lb/>
invitations-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Affectionately your old friend</salute>
<signed>J. R. Kean</signed>
Cornelia joins me for you &amp; your Mary-<lb/>
</closer>
