<salute>My dear Major Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I thought it would be proper to cable to you<lb/>
concerning the suspicious case reported at Felton so that you<lb/>
should not be unprepared if any exaggerated reports are sent by<lb/>
other parties.</p>
<p>Dr. Thomason does not evidently attach much<lb/>
importance to the case. He writes to me (Sept. 29) &ldquo;Found (<hi>on ar-<lb/>
rival</hi>) they had one <unclear>case</unclear> under observation at Felton but the symp-<lb/>
toms were such that we have not thought them sufficiently suspi-<lb/>
cious to bother the Department, with reporting the case even as<lb/>
a suspect. I however sent Cartaya over Sunday to see the case<lb/>
and I enclose you the clinical history and his report, from which<lb/>
you will probably agree with me that there is little ground to<lb/>
believe the case worthy of alarm. However in order to take no<lb/>
chances I am sending in the morning Bustillo with two capataces<lb/>
with authority to hire sufficient obreros there to fumigate with<lb/>
canvas thoroughly the house in which the man was sick and the<lb/>
surrounding dwellings.&rdquo;-</p>
<p>The conclusions of Dr. Cartaya's report are<lb/>
as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A case like the one described above, in which<lb/>
during the first three days of illness temperatures taken in<lb/>
axilla showed <unclear>39&deg;</unclear>, should have presented more marked icterus if<lb/>
it were a case of yellow fever, more grave <unclear>sysptoms</unclear> and hemorr-<lb/>
hages none of which have appeared.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06234002"/>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>But on the other hand a fever which ends or runs<lb/>
its course in six or seven days, in which on the third and fourth<lb/>
day (according to the chart) there is a dissociation between the<lb/>
pulse and the temperature, accompanied by headache and general<lb/>
pains, vomiting icteric tint (?) and a large amount of albumin,<lb/>
must be regarded as suspicious and from a sanitary and prophylac-<lb/>
tic standpoint should be treated as if it were yellow fever&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I <unclear>agred</unclear> therefore with the Havana Commission in<lb/>
recommending that all the prophylactic measures be carefully car-<lb/>
ried out.</p>
<p>Dr. Fauntleroy informs me that Dr. Agostini reported<lb/>
to him on September 24 that the case at Felton had been seen by<lb/>
him and Dr. Carulla from its incipiency and had put it under a<lb/>
mosquito bar. He and Dr. Carulla and Gomez saw it together on<lb/>
the 22nd. and negatived it for yellow fever, considering it a-<lb/>
cute nephritis after long exposure to water and wind. He, Dr.<lb/>
Fauntleroy considered it negative for yellow fever after seeing<lb/>
chart but ordered prophylactic measures to be taken.</p>
<p>The telegram of which I herewith enclose a copy<lb/>
was sent to Dr. Thomason October 2nd..</p>
<p>Nothing suspicious has developed either in Havana<lb/>
or in any other part of the Island. But the result of Dr. Agra-<lb/>
monte's investigations at Cienfuegos where he was sent last Sun-<lb/>
day has fully justified our <unclear>suspicion</unclear> that they were not so free<lb/>
of mosquito breeding places as they had imagined. Agramonte ac-<lb/>
companied by the local Inspector examined fifty seven houses in<lb/>
seventeen of which larvae were found. I expect to have his writ-<lb/>
ten report to day.</p>
<p>I fear that my correspondance on these dreary mat-<lb/>
ters must be interfering with your enjoiment of the Congress and<lb/>
of the amenities of the trip.</p>
<p>With kind regards to our friends in Washington<lb/>
and kindest messages to you from Drs. Barnet and Lopez del Va-<lb/>
lle, believe me my dear Major,</p>
