<salute>Dear Jack:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you and Miss Frederick very much for &ldquo;rounding up&rdquo; Lizana<lb/>
and San Buenaventura for me. I am sorry to have left them in Baltimore,<lb/>
but I was suffering while there with a dying nerve in one of my teeth.<lb/>
This made attention to detail difficult.</p>
<p>Up, to last Monday, when she had to leave town, Miss Brown and I<lb/>
ha<del>ve</del><add>d</add> been working hard, both separately and together, on the additional<lb/>
investigation you wished made on the list of bibliographic references<lb/>
you gave me in Baltimore. Will try to send over what we have already<lb/>
found tomorrow and other things as we clear them up. <del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del>We are trying<lb/>
to do this as quickly as possible, in the hope that the fractional equi-<lb/>
valent for the &ldquo;seven consecutive days,&rdquo; which you felt would be suffi-<lb/>
cient to complete the final editing, may materialize more quickly then<lb/>
we dared hope when last I saw you.</p>
<p>In the interim--oh! Friend of my Father!--there is as much chance<lb/>
of my &ldquo;forgetting about the book and taking up other interests&rdquo; as there<lb/>
would be of you and &ldquo;big Susan&rdquo; following a similar proceedure had &ldquo;lit-<lb/>
tle Susan&rdquo; (which the Lord forbid!) had to be consigned to the care of<lb/>
the best surgeon on earth for some operation essential to her future ex-<lb/>
istence. You might, <hi>as have I!</hi> the most perfect and entire confidence in<lb/>
your man, but until the thing was done, I think that you would find it<lb/>
as hard as I to live for anything beyond his &ldquo;pronunciamento&rdquo; that all<lb/>
at last was &ldquo;well<add>.&rdquo;</add><del>with the child&rdquo;.</del></p>
<p>When you have a half hour to spare, I should be glad to take over<lb/>
some books (<hi>re</hi> the date of the beginnings of the wanderings of the Chi-<lb/>
chemecs: Sec. iii. p. i. page 12, as I do not see how we can let the ref.<lb/>
to the Anales de Chimalpahin stand). These books also have some maps I<lb/>
am sure you would like to see. By the way Herrera gives &ldquo;R. de <unclear>cempoal</unclear>&rdquo;<lb/>
as <hi>north</hi> of Vera Cruz, <del><unclear>as does</unclear></del> Joyce, an eminent modern authority (See<lb/>
Ency. Brit, 1929) gives &ldquo;Cempoala&rdquo; about 15 miles north of Vera Cruz, on<lb/>
the coast. Clavigero, however, in his old map of the Mexican Empire gives<lb/>
&ldquo;Chempoalla,&rdquo; to the south of Vera Crux: also about 15 miles.<lb/>
