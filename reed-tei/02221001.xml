<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Last eve-<lb/>
ning the wind came up from<lb/>
the north-west, and my! how<lb/>
it did blow all night- This<lb/>
morning, the temperature stood<lb/>
at 69&deg; -- which with the hard<lb/>
wind made one feel decid-<lb/>
edly chilly, especially with<lb/>
a short-sleeved gauze un-<lb/>
der garment on. Now it<lb/>
is blowing from the north<lb/>
and promises to become much<lb/>
colder to-night- I take it that<lb/>
you have no longer, therefore,<lb/>
any complaint about the<lb/>
<hi>hot</hi> weather in Washington.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02221002"/>
You must have had a lively<lb/>
Zephyr to have given us<lb/>
such a blow- I hope that it<lb/>
hasn't increased the gouty<lb/>
sensations in your darling<lb/>
lame &ldquo;footsey&rdquo;- I didn't get<lb/>
any letter from my sweet<lb/>
Miss Gouty, yesterday, and<lb/>
hence I haven't very late<lb/>
news as to your general<lb/>
state of health- Somehow<lb/>
or other those letters of<lb/>
yours are mailed on the<lb/>
wrong day- But the fact<lb/>
of the whole matter is that<lb/>
the Post Office Department<lb/>
is managed wretchedly here<lb/>
in Havana- They don't trou-<lb/>
ble themselves much about<lb/>
a prompt distribution of<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02221003"/>
the incoming mail- Whenever<lb/>
your darling letters come,<lb/>
I enjoy them very much,<lb/>
and I know that <add>when</add> one isn't<lb/>
feeling well, its hard to<lb/>
be writing letters- I guess<lb/>
tomorrow I will get one<lb/>
not only from precious<lb/>
Miss Gout, but, also, from<lb/>
bouncing Miss Silk Petty Coat!<lb/>
To think that thanksgiving is<lb/>
nearly here -- only day after<lb/>
tomorrow -- and then Novem-<lb/>
ber will have flown- I<lb/>
sometimes get awfully im=<lb/>
patient, but you know<lb/>
that such a frame of mind<lb/>
is nothing unusual with<lb/>
your old Mr Teesigon! Don't<lb/>
you, Miss Sweet Gouty?<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02221004"/>
I suppose that I ought to<lb/>
feel satisfied with the prog-<lb/>
ress made thus far with<lb/>
my experimental station --<lb/>
and in truth I am -- but<lb/>
Cuban carpenters are so<lb/>
slow &amp; so much like American<lb/>
carpenters, when they are<lb/>
working by the day- I am having<lb/>
two small houses constructed-<lb/>
I don't know whether I have<lb/>
told you this already -- one<lb/>
for mosquito-bitten patients,<lb/>
and the other for testing the<lb/>
clothing infection theory -- but<lb/>
I don't want to try the latter<lb/>
until I have succeeded or<lb/>
failed with the former. Another<lb/>
week, I hope, will enable us<lb/>
to tell what mosquitos can<lb/>
do, as we now have some<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02221005"/>
insects that bit yellow<lb/>
fever cases 10 days ago to-<lb/>
day- If we can get them<lb/>
to live 8 or 10 days more, I<lb/>
believe we can reproduce the<lb/>
disease promptly- I think<lb/>
that if it required 12 days<lb/>
in august to render the mos-<lb/>
quitoes effective, it will take<lb/>
18 to 24 days at this season-<lb/>
This is, of course, only my opin-<lb/>
ion, and I may be quite mis-<lb/>
taken- I wrote the foregoing<lb/>
part of this page at 3 o'clock,<lb/>
this afternoon, and now it is<lb/>
9.30 P.M. and I am sitting here<lb/>
<del>now</del> in my overcoat with<lb/>
doors &amp; windows all closed<lb/>
&amp; lamp burning full-tilt.<lb/>
The thermometer has fallen to<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02221006"/>
61&deg;- I walked out on the porch<lb/>
just now and what a perfectly<lb/>
beautiful sky I found, with<lb/>
the young moon hanging low<lb/>
in the sky and the stars so<lb/>
very bright- The clouds of<lb/>
yesterday and to-day have<lb/>
gone and the night is fas-<lb/>
cinatingly beautiful- What<lb/>
a wonderful winter-climate<lb/>
this is, where frost never<lb/>
comes; and yet what a<lb/>
blessing a real hard<lb/>
frost would be to this<lb/>
Island. I wrote Johnnie<lb/>
Moore a letter, this afternoon,<lb/>
and told him how much<lb/>
I appreciated the good<lb/>
hard work that he had<lb/>
put on that stone-fence.<lb/>
I asked him to write to<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02221007"/>
me &amp; tell me about the trees<lb/>
&amp;c- I guess that we don't<lb/>
need to build any more stone-<lb/>
fences for awhile, do we,<lb/>
my sweetheart? How I long<lb/>
for the spring-time and the month<lb/>
of May to come, so that we<lb/>
can go up and spend a week<lb/>
at dear Keewaydin and plant<lb/>
our garden and the flower-<lb/>
beds that so gladden dear<lb/>
Miss Gouty's heart! You<lb/>
shall have beautiful flowers<lb/>
next year, lovie, dear: and pre-<lb/>
cious little scholar must have<lb/>
a flower-bed too, for her<lb/>
own darling little hands<lb/>
to work and <add>to</add> keep the grass<lb/>
<del>clean</del><add>all</add> pulled out- And then,<lb/>
too, those grape<del>s</del>-<add>vines</add> should give<lb/>
us many bunches, and those<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02221008"/>
berries- rasp, straw and<lb/>
black -- should be quite<lb/>
ausgezeichnete! Give my<lb/>
kindest regards to Dr Nash<lb/>
and tell him how much I ap-<lb/>
preciate his services to you,<lb/>
and that I would have written<lb/>
to him, but have been so<lb/>
very busy- Somehow I feel<lb/>
sleepy, to-night, sweet oomsey,<lb/>
and hence I am going to say<lb/>
good-night to my sweet girls<lb/>
and tumble into my little couch-<lb/>
Boo! Boo! you darling, fat Joys!<lb/>
<hi>Wednesday morning</hi> -- <hi>Nov. 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>.<lb/>
Here I am, having overslept<lb/>
myself, &amp; I now hear the rattle<lb/>
of the Postman's wagon<lb/>
as he comes for the mail.<lb/>
Boo! Boo! you precious loves.<lb/>
Love &amp; Kisses for my sweet<lb/>
girls-</p>
