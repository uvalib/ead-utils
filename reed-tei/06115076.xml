<p>Hench is pleased Wood was able to visit the Reeds. He spent some time trying to locate Lazear's notebook in the Archives, but was unable to do so. He is still interested in her manuscript and offers to read it.</p>

<salute>My dear Miss Wood:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am delighted that you are going to see the Reeds. I had a<lb/>
letter yesterday from Blossom, saying that her mother was in Walter Reed<lb/>
Hospital but will be out soon. I am also glad that you saw the material<lb/>
at the Archives. Frankly, I didn't spend much time on it as most of it per-<lb/>
tained to the years previous to Cuba, in which I am only faintly interested;<lb/>
nor do I remember seeing the letters of Reed which you mention. If you run<lb/>
across any letters of his to the Surgeon General or others pertaining to<lb/>
the yellow fever years, I would certainly appreciate knowing about it.</p>
<p>I had a letter today from General Kean, also from Walter Reed Hospital.<lb/>
It is a shame that he is feeling so poorly. I spent much time trying to un-<lb/>
cover Lazear's little notebook in the Archives somewhere but still haven't<lb/>
found it.</p>
<p>You mention some naval officer interested in Walter Reed. At home in<lb/>
my files I have a letter from him. His name at the moment escapes me. He<lb/>
has been working on it for years and is only interested in the history of yellow<lb/>
fever in the navy.</p>
<p>Let me say again what a pleasure it was for us to meet you and I am<lb/>
so sorry we didn't get to see you the day we left. You are very generous to<lb/>
offer to send me the photostats when you are through with them.</p>
<p>I shall be indeed interested in your manuscript and I still stand<lb/>
ready to read it if you want me to, not only to be as helpful as possible<lb/>
but also for eager curiosity.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>

P. S. I hope the little enclosure will not be misunderstood and that<lb/>
you will not think you have to replace the Walter Reed book that I sent you.<lb/>
It happens that every now and then I see one advertised for sale and thought<lb/>
you might like to know of it in case you might want to collect one of each<lb/>
edition. The enclosed is from the current list of the Old Hickory Bookshop.<lb/>
