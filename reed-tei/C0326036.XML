<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I had a very satisfactory talk with Dr. Frost in Bal-<lb/>
timore last week (so far as the outline maps were concerned; as well<lb/>
as <add>concerning</add> some other details of his plans for the work on which my own, and<lb/>
Miss Brown's activities would be dependent).</p>
<p><hi>Re</hi> the outline maps, I took them over with me, rather an un-<lb/>
dertaking as they are almost as large as I am and will neither fold nor<lb/>
roll. Dr. Frost was very much pleased with them. They <hi>are</hi> beautifully<lb/>
done. Dr. Frost decided to only use one map for Middle America, the<lb/>
out-lying islands and the northern part of South America. I had had two<lb/>
made in accordance with Dr. Morley's and my tentative plans of 1926.<lb/>
However, the duplicate will be excellent for experimental lettering,<lb/>
which is needed on account of both the ancient and modern names of<lb/>
many places having to be given. This, as Dr. Frost says, will have to<lb/>
be most carefully done in order not to interfere with the appearance of<lb/>
the maps--i. e. must be <add>&ldquo;</add>tried out.<add>&rdquo;</add> I shall probably have to have a<lb/>
photostat made of the map of Mercator's projection of the West Coast<lb/>
of Africa and the East Coast of America with inter-lying islands. This,<lb/>
unless I find it is cheaper to have a duplicate outline drawn., for the<lb/>
aforesaid trying out.</p>
<p>Dr. Frost also approved my suggestion that Miss Brown and<lb/>
I go through Father's MS, and make an alphabetic list (card index) of<lb/>
the places (towns, rivers, islands etc. etc.) mentioned by Father which<lb/>
would be needed for filling in the maps. This list has, of course,<lb/>
already been started, indeed, I wrote to Miss Brown before leaving Bal-<lb/>
timore so that she could begin work before my return.</p>
<p>Dr. Frost hopes to soon be able to resume work on the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fc0326037"/>
on the<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
final editing <add>of the</add> the MS. Were it not for many unexpected things coming<lb/>
up he could have done so e'er this. For instance, he had to go to<lb/>
Philadelphia last week as <add>an</add> expert witness. The case was postponed, <unclear>aft<del>ter</del><add>er</add></unclear><lb/>
his arrival, but not before he had lost valuable time both by his<lb/>
actual absence, his preparations therefor etc. etc. However, I am hop-<lb/>
ing soon to be called over <add>to Baltimore</add> again and, in the interim, can have the satis-<lb/>
faction of getting the maps &ldquo;under way.&rdquo; I asked Dr. Ramsey if, before<lb/>
the outline map for Africa (West) were filled in, he would go over my<lb/>
list, which he said he would be glad to do. I am sure this will be a<lb/>
real help.</p>
<p>I had the privelege and happiness of a most interesting talk<lb/>
with Dr. Welch at a dinner in Baltimore. As you know, he is much in-<lb/>
terested in Father's book and says that he has frequently mentioned it<lb/>
abroad, where its publication is <add>also</add> being looked forward to.</p>
<p>With very best remembrances, I remain</p>
<closer>
