Dr. Austin Smith, Editor<lb/>
Journal of the American Medical Association<lb/>
535 North Dearborn<lb/>
Chicago 10, Illinois<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Smith:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I returned from Cuba Sunday night after a very pleasant trip. I have<lb/>
your letter of December 8 requesting information regarding the dedica-<lb/>
tion. I appreciate very much your interest and <unclear>fill</unclear> bure that the Cubans<lb/>
do too.</p>
<p>I can do one of two things. I can send you now a number of clippings, three<lb/>
or four from the Havana Post, published in English, and a half dozen or more<lb/>
published in Spanish and can, within a very few days, send you some glossy<lb/>
prints taken at the ceremony in case you should want to publish one or two.<lb/>
From the above, you can write your own story.</p>
<p>Or, if you prefer to have me write up the affair (as if, perhaps, I were<lb/>
your Havana correspondent), I will do so but I cannot do it until after Christ-<lb/>
mas or New Year's. I am trying very hard to finish a chapter on cortisone<lb/>
which was due November 1. This will take every moment of my time between<lb/>
now and Christmas. I have promised the Clinic to write up the story of the<lb/>
Camp Lazear dedication and present it at staff shortly after New Year's<lb/>
under <unclear>andban</unclear> heading as &ldquo;Camp Lazear near Havana - a New Medical Shrine&rdquo;<lb/>
or something like that. Let me know your wishes.</p>
<p>The affair was really very nice and represents a very fine beginning,<lb/>
something upon which we can build steadily.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M.D.</signed>

P.S.: Your A.M.A. representative arrived at the very last <unclear>second</unclear> of the<lb/>
last minute. Not having received his name from Doctor Lull, I had no cer-<lb/>
tainty of his arrival. I felt it was so important that the A.M.A. be rep-<lb/>
resented that, in view of the letters of yourself and Doctor Lull to me, I<lb/>
went ahead and bought a wreath and had asked Ambassador <unclear>Beaulac</unclear> to lay it<lb/>
but at the last minute, Doctor Chrisman of Miami arrived and laid the first<lb/>
wreath. He and his wife were charming people and I was delighted to meet<lb/>
them.<lb/>
