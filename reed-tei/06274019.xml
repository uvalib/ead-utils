<salute>My dear Mrs. Ames:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of 4 December and am glad to reply to it<lb/>
but fear that I cannot shed any light on the question of Dr. Ames's<lb/>
alleged attack of yellow fever. If he did in fact have an attack of<lb/>
yellow fever in Cuba it is certainly extraordinary that I should not<lb/>
have known of it, but as you know, I had never heard of it until you<lb/>
mentioned it in your letter some little time ago. It was a generally<lb/>
accepted fact that he was an immune, and the only mention which Major<lb/>
Walter Reed makes of him in his published articles on the work of the<lb/>
Board he speaks of him as an immune. It is my recollection that he<lb/>
was selected to be in charge of the personnel of Camp Lazear on that<lb/>
account. I left Havana on 30 January, 1901 to go to Washington for<lb/>
my examination for promotion. I was absent only three weeks and it<lb/>
was, I now understand, during this period that he was sick for a few<lb/>
days in the hospital at Camp Columbia. If the records state that this<lb/>
sickness was yellow fever I believe it must be a clerical error or I<lb/>
would have heard of it on my return. I am perfectly certain that it<lb/>
was not one of the experimental cases of yellow fever, and if a case<lb/>
of yellow fever not experimental had originated in the camp, I am sure<lb/>
I would have heard of it. I agree with what General Ireland told you<lb/>
that the period of sickness in the hospital was entirely too short for<lb/>
even a mild case. All cases that I have ever seen where there was no<lb/>
doubt about the diagnosis were in the hospital more than a week, and were<lb/>
followed by a long period of weakness and depression; I am sure it was<lb/>
so in my case.</p>
<p>If you want to get an official record of this illness of Dr.<lb/>
Ames's in February you will have to get it by applying to the Adjutant<lb/>
General. The Surgeon General's Office does not, as you would suppose,<lb/>
keep the sick and wounded cards after he had tabulated them and made<lb/>
his annual report. Then the original records are transferred to the<lb/>
Adjutant General's Office for file, and he is the only official in the<lb/>
War Department who is authorized to give out information concerning<lb/>
them.</p>
<p>Wishing you a Merry Christmas, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>(Signed) J. R. Kean<lb/>
Colonel, U.S. Army, Retd.</signed>
