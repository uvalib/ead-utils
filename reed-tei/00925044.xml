Dr. H.R. Carter,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Carter,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have read with great interest your letter of January first. Although this<lb/>
is considerably after January first we are still balancing our accounts and are<lb/>
trying to get up a statement of our expenses up to the end of the year '21.<lb/>
Either we are slow or we have a heap of accounts to balance- probably both.<lb/>
Am glad to note what you say about Dr. Arce's theories. I could not see where<lb/>
he had anything to back him up in his ridiculous statements about a Blackwater<lb/>
fever which runs in epidemics and gives immunity. The Academy of Medicine<lb/>
seems to have taken our point of view and voted him down to a man - he was the<lb/>
only man in the Academy who voted against the diagnosis of yellow fever. They<lb/>
even went so far as to suggest that there should be some further studies made<lb/>
in regard to Fiebre billosa hemoglobinurica which he had reported some years ago.</p>
<p>In order that you may not entirely forget the family I am inclosing some<lb/>
views of the &ldquo;kiddies&rdquo; we have taken lately. Martha often speaks of Dr. Carter.</p>
<p>In regard to what Col. White said about the soldiers who were vaccinated, I<lb/>
presume that that is best answered in the reprint of Col. Vergne's article which<lb/>
I sent you a few days ago. I do not remember the exact detail of which you speak,<lb/>
of the 50 soldiers of whom 25 were vaccinated and 25 unvaccinated. However, we<lb/>
did vaccinate, in the latter part of the epidemic, about 225 soldiers, and of<lb/>
those vaccinated (although there still occurred cases in Lambayeque) we had no<lb/>
cases among them. In Paijan, Dr. Tapia told me that so far as he knew there<lb/>
were no cases among the persons who were vaccinated in Paijan.</p>

<p>In regard to Dr. Cross, I saw a notice of his death in the Comercio and later<lb/>
received a letter from Dr. Rose telling me about the incident. He contracted<lb/>
his fever at Tuxtepec, took <unclear>sick</unclear> there and was transferred to Vera Cruz. The<lb/>
moving of him from Tuxtepec to Vera Cruz, in my mind, was the principal cause<lb/>
of his death. In our experience we have had a very high mortality among<lb/>
all cases which have been moved, and I have attempted to establish a very<lb/>
rigid rule that no case of yellow fever be moved if there is any way to avoid<lb/>
it. I am inclined to think that by proper care of cases the percentage of<lb/>
deaths can be reduced very considerably. I failed to understand Dr. Noguchi's<lb/>
line of reasoning in what you say of this vaccination. I do not see why the<lb/>
fact of eleven days between the first and second doses should necessarily<lb/>
neutralize the effect of the first dose. The only thing I can see is that<lb/>
if he was bitten very shortly after the second dose, within the first few days,<lb/>
when their might have been a possible negative phase immediately following<lb/>
vaccination that this might have given rise to a temporarily lowered resistance<lb/>
and made him more susceptible to infections temporarily. Very probably Noguchi<lb/>
is right in the matter but I honestly cannot see it. I do not see that his<lb/>
theory harmonizes with what I thought I knew about vaccinations and immunities<lb/>
resulting there from. However, we will talk more about this when I see you in<lb/>
New York in June.</p>
<p>In regard to your question <unclear>about</unclear> the value of vaccination, or rather data as<lb/>
to the value of it, what I have mentioned in regard to Paijan and the troops<lb/>

3.<lb/>
is about all I can tell you on that point. Of the eight soldiers who fell<lb/>
sick and to whom curative serum was given, six of the eight recovered. These<lb/>
soldiers were Cerranos. But the fact of the matter is that I have not <unclear></unclear> had<lb/>
time to stop and make accurate observations.</p>
<p>As to the name of the <unclear>clerk</unclear> at Duncan &amp; Fox's, I presume it must be Miller<lb/>
to whom you refer as he was the fourth one at the time we were there.</p>
<p>Mr. Wrightson's activities seem to be somewhat limited. The president<lb/>
asked him recently to go and make an investigation in Paita, but Wrightson<lb/>
suggested that he had better stay on in Lima until after his reorganization<lb/>
bill had gone through Congress - to which the president replied that maybe<lb/>
that was so, probably it would be as well if he stayed.</p>
<p>In so far as our work is concerned, it seems we are getting along well and<lb/>
that we are going to finish the job. In order to know about this I have recently<lb/>
sent Dunn, Olivari and Caballero south to Ica so that we shall have complete<lb/>
data on all the coast; they will even go farther south than that and will be<lb/>
gone about a month, investigating closely both for suspicious cases of illness<lb/>
and stegomya breeding, and to some extent <unclear>anophleles</unclear> breeding.</p>
<p>The Rockefellers, recently, sent me a map of Mexico showing the distribution<lb/>
of the disease there during the past two years, and I must say that after<lb/>
looking that copy over the <unclear>Mexic<del>an</del><add>o</add></unclear>-Central American situation looks much more<lb/>
serious and unsettled than I had supposed that it was. The distribution is<lb/>
rather annoying, at least it would be to me if I were in Dr. White's position<lb/>
of General Director for the whole thing. It looks to me like a proposition<lb/>
which cannot be finished in 1922 as I had previously expected and hoped would be<lb/>
