</opener>
<p>Well, we have been<lb/>
out a day now, and the weather<lb/>
has been magnificent. I have<lb/>
not been the least bit uncomfortable,<lb/>
in fact, Norris is the only one of<lb/>
our party who has been under<lb/>
the weather, and as he was<lb/>
sick before coming aboard,<lb/>
it can hardly be called sea<lb/>
sickness in his case. The only<lb/>
motion the vessel has is a<lb/>
very long pitch, which is<lb/>
really rather pleasant. I need<lb/>
not have closed the note I sent<lb/>
by the pilot so soon as he did<lb/>
not leave for some time after<lb/>
but I did not want him to get<lb/>
off without it. George Lyon said<lb/>
he would send a passenger list<lb/>
to you. It is very small as you<lb/>
see. I am glad there are so few<lb/>
as it enabled me to have my<lb/>
trunk put into one of the spare state-<lb/>
rooms, out of the road. I found<lb/>
that my trunk was too high to go under<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00127002"/>
2<lb/>
the berth, and if I had not been<lb/>
able to have it in the other<lb/>
state-room it would have made<lb/>
it uncomfortable for me all the<lb/>
way over.</p>
<p>I slept very well last night<lb/>
and when I get used to the<lb/>
difficulties of making my toilet<lb/>
in such small space, with<lb/>
the floor writhing under <add>me</add>, I shall<lb/>
ask nothing more in the way<lb/>
of comfort. The table is fair.<lb/>
I am learning what things<lb/>
to take and what to decline.<lb/>
The oat-meal or &ldquo;porridge&rdquo; as<lb/>
they call it was excellent.<lb/>
I was on deck until ten last<lb/>
night and I have stayed out<lb/>
all day to-day except when at<lb/>
meals. I am writing this in the<lb/>
smoking-room which opens on<lb/>
the deck.</p>
<p>We have had vessels of some<lb/>
sort in sight all day to-day.<lb/>
There was a steamer north of<lb/>
us following pretty much the<lb/>
same course, she has now dis-<lb/>
appeared.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00127003"/>
<p>3</p>
<p>This afternoon the crew had &ldquo;boat<lb/>
drill&rdquo;, getting out the life boats,<lb/>
and &ldquo;fire drill&rdquo; which only meant<lb/>
stretching out the hose and<lb/>
attaching it to the pump.</p>
<p>Every little thing causes a sensation<lb/>
on shipboard, soon after lunch<lb/>
a little row boat was seen<lb/>
ahead and everyone rushed <del>ahead</del><lb/>
forward to see what was<lb/>
up. It turned out to be a boat<lb/>
from a pilot-boat which we<lb/>
could see at some distance<lb/>
off. They came to us for some<lb/>
papers; these were thrown out<lb/>
to them and we passed on<lb/>
leaving them astern and they<lb/>
soon disappeared and the<lb/>
excitement was all over<lb/>
Before leaving New York I got a<lb/>
copy of Marie Bashkirtseff, but<lb/>
I have succeeded in reading<lb/>
but a few pages. The novelty<lb/>
of the sea has not worn off yet<lb/>
and I enjoy simply looking about<lb/>
me.</p>
<p>There are a number of types among<lb/>
the passengers. There are several<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00127004"/>
4<lb/>
English tourists, &amp; a loud-mouthed<lb/>
westerner (who is the biggest<lb/>
fool on board). He attempts to<lb/>
defend everything in America<lb/>
that the Englishmen attack<lb/>
and thus makes himself<lb/>
rediculous. Then there is the<lb/>
dashing girl trying to carry<lb/>
on two flirtations with the<lb/>
Captain and a young Scotchman.<lb/>
Then there are several ladies<lb/>
who <add>are</add> terribly sick and some<lb/>
children likewise. There<lb/>
is an Englishwoman, who<lb/>
reminds me of the military woman<lb/>
in &ldquo;The Queen's Shilling,&rdquo; both in<lb/>
looks and actions. I thought<lb/>
she would come to blows with<lb/>
her husband at breakfast<lb/>
this morning.</p>
<p>I think I prefer the inside<lb/>
stateroom to the outside, it is<lb/>
not so <unclear>gloomy</unclear> in the morning<lb/>
and the air is just as good<lb/>
We leave the doors into the hall<lb/>
open &amp; pull a curtain across.</p>
<pb n="5" id="f00127005"/>
<p>5</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>
<p>I have let two days go by without<lb/>
writing. Nothing particularly eventful<lb/>
occurred until to-day and<lb/>
yet the time has passed very<lb/>
pleasantly. Three vessels have<lb/>
passed in sight during the<lb/>
three days, and one of them<lb/>
came near enough to signal,<lb/>
she was a Swedish brig sailing<lb/>
from Hayti to Sweden.</p>
<p>To-day however we had a<lb/>
much greater sensation in the<lb/>
shape of three ice bergs. Two<lb/>
of them were small and far<lb/>
off and showed only as white<lb/>
shining points on the horizon,<lb/>
the other although quite a distance<lb/>
away was of large size and<lb/>
could be seen distinctly. It was<lb/>
a beautiful sight, glistening<lb/>
in the sun.</p>
<p>The weather continues beautiful<lb/>
and I have had no touch of<lb/>
sea-sickness. Waring succumbed<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00127006"/>
6<lb/>
day before yesterday, but he is better<lb/>
now, and Norris is perfectly well.<lb/>
We are now abreast of the<lb/>
banks of New-Foundland.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we<lb/>
are near New-Foundland, as<lb/>
the banks extend hundreds of<lb/>
miles south of New Foundland.<lb/>
In fact we are south of<lb/>
New York our course so far having<lb/>
been south by south east. We<lb/>
have gone <del>as</del> by this route on<lb/>
purpose to avoid the banks,<lb/>
after we have passed them<lb/>
we will change the course to<lb/>
the northward. The ocean<lb/>
is remarkably smooth to-day,<lb/>
there is hardly a ripple on the<lb/>
long ocean swells.</p>
<p>Some of the people on board the<lb/>
boat are really very pleasant<lb/>
white some are the opposite.<lb/>
The loud-mouthed turns out to be a<lb/>
Catholic priest and an army<lb/>
chaplain in New Mexico. He has<lb/>
behaved outrageously, he got beastly<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f00127007"/>
7<lb/>
drunk several times and went<lb/>
around insulting people until<lb/>
now they refuse to sell him liquor<lb/>
and as he has used up what<lb/>
he brought on board he is<lb/>
safely disposed of. On Monday<lb/>
night he tried to enter the smoking<lb/>
room when he stumbled on<lb/>
the sill and fell headlong<lb/>
stunning himself. Two of the<lb/>
stewards carried him below<lb/>
and from that time they refused<lb/>
to sell liquor to him.</p>
<p>The dashing girl I spoke about<lb/>
turns out to be the wife of<lb/>
one of the Dents.</p>
<p>There is a bride and groom on<lb/>
board, who spoon continually.<lb/>
Everyone is constantly catching them<lb/>
at it, which is very embarrassing.<lb/>
Up to Sunday night it was very<lb/>
cold but since that time we have<lb/>
been in the gulf-stream, and it<lb/>
has been so warm that we could<lb/>
sit on deck without overcoats.<lb/>
It was very cold however while we<lb/>
were near the ice-bergs. The temperature<lb/>
of the water fell 20 degrees in an hour and a half</p>
<pb n="8" id="f00127008"/>
<p>8</p>
<p>Friday May 23.</p>
<p>Our fine weather has forsaken<lb/>
us for the time. All last night<lb/>
and today the wind has been<lb/>
very high, and we have pitched<lb/>
and tossed at a great rate.<lb/>
Every now and then a wave<lb/>
breaks over the deck, thundering<lb/>
against the cabin and soaking<lb/>
any one who happens to be in its<lb/>
way. Although I was out<lb/>
a great deal this morning<lb/>
I was fortunate in not getting<lb/>
caught. One gentleman was<lb/>
caught by a wave which<lb/>
washed clear over the<lb/>
<del><unclear>Eua</unclear></del> Hurricane deck. The smoke -<lb/>
stack is all incrusted with<lb/>
salt from the spray. This morning<lb/>
before I was up four ice-bergs<lb/>
were seen.</p>
<p>I have found it very hard to<lb/>
study since I came on board.<lb/>
The constant motion seems<lb/>
to prevent application.</p>
<p>The service and table have really<lb/>
been very good since the first day.</p>
<pb n="9" id="f00127009"/>
<p>9</p>
<p>Quite a number of people succumbed<lb/>
to seasickness last night and the<lb/>
attendance at meals has consequently<lb/>
diminished. Norris and Waring are<lb/>
somewhat off to-day &amp; Nicoll is<lb/>
making a hard fight against it.<lb/>
I<del>n</del> am still feeling perfectly<lb/>
comfortable, and really enjoying<lb/>
the motion, I slept soundly<lb/>
all last night although<lb/>
the they say the rolling was<lb/>
very bad.</p>
<p>The latest sensation aboard is<lb/>
a birth which took place last<lb/>
night in the steerage.</p>
<p>I have made friends with<lb/>
the surgeon and have had<lb/>
several talks with him about<lb/>
Edinburgh, of which he is a<lb/>
graduate.</p>
<pb n="10" id="f00127010"/>
<p>10</p>
<p><del>Tues</del> Monday.</p>
<p>Our gale lasted us two days but<lb/>
yesterday morning we found the<lb/>
sky bright and the sea smooth<lb/>
and it remains so to-day.<lb/>
The motion of the vessel yesterday<lb/>
was so slight that it was<lb/>
hardly perceptible.</p>
<p>It is expected that we will<lb/>
see the coast of Ireland some<lb/>
time tomorrow and land at<lb/>
Glasgow on Wednesday afternoon<lb/>
or evening.</p>
<p>Please tell Uncle Tom that I am<lb/>
glad I took his advice and<lb/>
came by the Anchor Line, the table<lb/>
service and everything have been<lb/>
as good as I could wish and<lb/>
much better than I expected on<lb/>
any steam-ship.</p>
<p>While the gale was on a great<lb/>
many funny things occurred at<lb/>
the table, the dishes slid around<lb/>
in a lively way and one young lady<lb/>
who is rather petite lost her<lb/>
balance and slid under the<lb/>
table.</p>
<pb n="11" id="f00127011"/>
<p>11</p>
<p>I have obtained some good points<lb/>
about London and Edinburgh from<lb/>
Englishmen &amp; Scotchmen on board<lb/>
some <del><unclear>ol</unclear></del> of these men are<lb/>
very pleasant indeed.</p>
<p>One of the amusements on board<lb/>
is making a pool on the days<lb/>
run. At noon the Captain<lb/>
makes an observation from<lb/>
which he calculates the<lb/>
latitude and longitude<lb/>
and from this gets the number<lb/>
of miles we have travelled<lb/>
in the last twenty-four hours.<lb/>
Just before twelve o'clock<lb/>
everyone puts a shilling in the<lb/>
pool and gets a number<lb/>
and when the run is announced<lb/>
the one holding the correct<lb/>
number gets the whole collection<lb/>
I was fortunate enough to hit<lb/>
the right one on Saturday.<lb/>
As the winner is expected to<lb/>
celebrate his victory by treating<lb/>
the crowd, the actual profits<lb/>
are not very large.</p>
<pb n="12" id="f00127012"/>
<p>12</p>
<p>Wednesday May 28. 7 a.m.</p>
<p>We are now sailing along the coast<lb/>
of Ireland, and very close in to<lb/>
shore and the scenery is really<lb/>
beautiful. There are little strips<lb/>
of crags and little strips of beach.<lb/>
Some of the hills are rocky and<lb/>
some are green.</p>
<p>We will reach Moville at<lb/>
about 8 o'clock and I will<lb/>
then mail this letter and<lb/>
cable if I can. We reach<lb/>
Glasgow sometime this evening.<lb/>
<del>am</del> If we arrive there early we<lb/>
will go on to Edinburgh at<lb/>
once, if not we will remain<lb/>
over night in Glasgow.</p>
<p>Night before last they had a concert<lb/>
on board which was hardly a<lb/>
howling success, however it had<lb/>
the virtue of being short.</p>
<p>Otherwise the life on board has<lb/>
not been varied. The weather has<lb/>
<pb n="13" id="f00127013"/>
13<lb/>
continued as fine as possible<lb/>
and the days have been growing<lb/>
longer and longer, until last<lb/>
night it was not dusk until<lb/>
after ten o'clock.</p>
<p>I hope to find a letter awaiting<lb/>
me when I reach Edinburgh.</p>
<p>I intend to direct this letter<lb/>
by way of <unclear>Queenstown</unclear> so that it<lb/>
will go on one of the Wednesday<lb/>
boats.</p>
<p>I think the trip has done me a<lb/>
great deal of good, I have not had<lb/>
a moments sickness, nor have I lost<lb/>
any sleep.</p>
<p>I hope you have been perfectly well<lb/>
while I have been making this<lb/>
long journey over the ocean blue.</p>
<p>A peculiar thing about an ocean<lb/>
trip is that you do not feel<lb/>
longing for a newspaper at breakfast.<lb/>
I really lost all curiosity as to<lb/>
the news of the day. I suppose I<lb/>
shall learn today what has<lb/>
happened during the last eleven<lb/>
days. <del>Yo</del></p>
<pb n="14" id="f00127014"/>
<p>14</p>
<p>I will write again when I get<lb/>
to Edinburgh</p>
<p>Give my love all at Uncle Tom's<lb/>
and at the Miller's.</p>
