<salute>Dear President Vincent:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of June 19th<lb/>
enclosing copy of Dr. Carter's letter and your reply.</p>
<p>Soon after Dr. White returned from<lb/>
his trip to Peru--it must have been in September or October,<lb/>
1921, for he returned in August--he came to see me at the<lb/>
Institute, told me that he felt assured of the efficacy of<lb/>
the vaccine, and related the experience in Peru which Dr.<lb/>
Carter questions. As Dr. White had just come from Peru,<lb/>
I took the story to be authentic and have quoted it once<lb/>
or twice. I think there can be no question of the fact,<lb/>
though there seems to have been some misunderstanding about<lb/>
who carried out the vaccinations. Perhaps they were done<lb/>
by someone other than Dr. Hanson, or, if done by him, they<lb/>
may have formed a part of the 200 vaccinations of soldiers<lb/>
reported by him in his speech before the Medical Association<lb/>
of the Canal Zone on August 19, as follows: &ldquo;We vaccinated<lb/>
about 1000 persons. In Lambayeque we vaccinated about 200<lb/>
soldiers and had no cases among them, in spite of the fact<lb/>
that they remained there before the fever had disappeared<lb/>
from the place. In Paij&aacute;n, which was the worst place, we had<lb/>
no cases among 200 who had been vaccinated, and these people<lb/>
were vaccinated very early in the game, when the fever was<lb/>
still very severe. We do not know if they were immunes or<lb/>
not. They gave us no assurance of having had the fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have forwarded the correspondence<lb/>
to Dr. White in Mexico City, asking him to let me know as soon<lb/>
as possible from whom he obtained the information regarding the<lb/>
group of 50 soldiers, who carried out the vaccinations, and<lb/>
where. I hope there has been no misunderstanding in such a matter as this.</p>
