<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you for your note of this morning<lb/>
and for the pictures which have come and on which<lb/>
Mr. Melvin Brewer is working to get a nice setup for<lb/>
the program. We have added to the invitation list the<lb/>
two names which you sent in this letter, Miss Adams and<lb/>
Mr. Drummond.</p>
<p>In regard to a representative from Johns<lb/>
Hopkins, I am afraid we cannot do that. If we did it,<lb/>
we would have to invite the President, and have decided<lb/>
that we have enough notables and will not attempt it.<lb/>
If the president could not come, we would have to<lb/>
invite the head of the Chemistry Department in view of<lb/>
the fact that we are dedicating a Chemistry Building.<lb/>
We are inviting the heads of chemistry departments in the<lb/>
surrounding area but not going as far as Baltimore.<lb/>
It would not be possible therefore in overlooking the<lb/>
president and the faculty at Hopkins to designate anyone<lb/>
else as representative of Hopkins.</p>
<p>However, we would be delighted to have Doctor<lb/>
Craig come and I am putting a special note in his<lb/>
invitation urging him to come. He will find a number of<lb/>
other Hopkins men here who are alumni of Washington and<lb/>
Jefferson College. I will invite him for the dinner in<lb/>
the evening just as you have suggested. Then if he sends<lb/>
his acceptance, we will send him his ticket for that dinner<lb/>
as well as for the exercises in the morning.</p>
<p>I think you now have received word that Doctor<lb/>
Cooke cannot come. He telegraphed. I don't know whether<lb/>
you have later word from Moran regarding Cooke, but the<lb/>
last word we have is that he will not be here. Every-<lb/>
thing else is set but no encouragement from him. I think<lb/>
I told you in my letter yesterday that I had a nice<lb/>
letter from your mother and that she is counting on attend-<lb/>
ing everything excepting the football game.</p>

<salute>Fraternally yours,</salute>
