Fort Apache, A.T.<lb/>
<date value="1880-02-27">February 27, '80.</date>
</dateline>
<salute>My dear Dorsey:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your last favor to hand-<lb/>
Orders No. 1. will be filed away, to be called<lb/>
into use, should Mr Lyons ever come<lb/>
back to Apache- As he has never signed<lb/>
the Muster Rolls, of course he can't be<lb/>
paid- However, Uncle Sam will be kind<lb/>
to him, I know, and one of these days, when<lb/>
he duly affixes his &ldquo;fist&rdquo; to the Rolls, I <add>will</add> see<lb/>
that he is rewarded with his Sheckels-<lb/>
It isn't often my dear boy that we have<lb/>
any news here, but Apache is <hi>to the<lb/>
front</hi> this time <hi>sure</hi>- Johannes Viven,<lb/>
otherwise &amp; more familiarly known as<lb/>
&ldquo;Jack&rdquo;, has actually preferred <hi>charges</hi><lb/>
against the <hi>K.O.!</hi></p>
<p>Hesche! How?<lb/>
Take a full breath, my boy, and steady<lb/>
yourself &amp; I'll explain- It came to pass<lb/>
after this wise- About a week ago,<lb/>
a prisoner escaped from the sentinel-<lb/>
His name is Andy Rouske, the same<lb/>
gent who threatened to &ldquo;put a head&rdquo; on<lb/>
on the good &ldquo;<unclear>Manny</unclear>&rdquo; Gatewood-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01771002"/>
It furthermore so happened that Jack<lb/>
was Officer of the day, &amp; was just sitting<lb/>
down to his oat-meal when the Serg't.<lb/>
of the Guard reported Rouske's escape-<lb/>
Jack continued his breakfast &amp; did not<lb/>
notify the K.O. of <del>it</del><add>the prisoner's escape</add> till he reported<lb/>
at the office after G. <unclear>Mommt</unclear>- The K.O.<lb/>
at once put two Indians on the prisoner's<lb/>
track &amp; found him lying down in the Ca&ntilde;on<lb/>
back of our quarters, about 300 yards<lb/>
from the place whence the festive Andy<lb/>
took his flight- The K.O. thereupon requested<lb/>
Jack to state in writing why he did not<lb/>
take more energetic means for the capture<lb/>
of the prisoner<del>s</del>, and upon <del>the</del> Jack<del>s</del> sending <add>in</add><lb/>
his explanation, the K.O. sat down &amp; wrote<lb/>
him a sharp communication, telling him<lb/>
that his explanation was &ldquo;unsatisfactory&rdquo;,<lb/>
and that in his opinion Jack was &ldquo;guilty<lb/>
of gross neglect of duty&rdquo; and that in<lb/>
the future, a more cheerful &amp; energetic<lb/>
discharge of duty would be expected<lb/>
of Cap't. Viven&rdquo;- Hesche! Thereupon<lb/>
Jack sits down &amp; ask<del>ed</del>s for a Court<lb/>
of Inquiry, to investigate the facts,<lb/>
&amp; in his application stated that he<lb/>
thought, if he was granted a Court,<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01771003"/>
&ldquo;that facts would be developed con-<lb/>
-cerning the discharge of duty by Officers<lb/>
at this Post, which should come to the<lb/>
notice of the Dep't. Commander&rdquo;! Hesche!<lb/>
When the eyes of the K.O. fell upon<lb/>
these words, he was wroth within him-<lb/>
self, &amp; he sent that application back to<lb/>
Jack &ldquo;awhizzing&rdquo;! directing Johannes<lb/>
&ldquo;to state in explicit terms&rdquo; any facts<lb/>
he had concerning the discharge of<lb/>
duty by officers at this Post- In a 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi><lb/>
Endorsement, John respectfully de-<lb/>
-clined, saying that these &ldquo;facts&rdquo; were<lb/>
a part of his defence &amp; intended for<lb/>
<add>the</add> perceptive ear of the Dep't. Commander<lb/>
only. The K.O. refused to &ldquo;see it&rdquo; in that<lb/>
light, and in a 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> End.<hi rend="superscript">mt</hi> tells Jack that<lb/>
he will send in charges (<hi>formal</hi><lb/>
charges, Dorsey,) against the before-<lb/>
mentioned &ldquo;Officers&rdquo;, and that he will<lb/>
do it p. d. q -- ! &amp; if he didn't comply,<lb/>
&ldquo;his refusual would be construed<lb/>
into intentional disobedience of<lb/>
orders&rdquo;! wasn't that brave in the<lb/>
dear man? <hi>Result -- 5</hi> charges and<lb/>
<hi>15</hi> specifications, &amp; they are now<lb/>
at Camp Thomas, on their way<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01771004"/>
to the Head fountain- The charges<lb/>
&amp; specifications include drunkenness <add>on duty</add>,<lb/>
gambling, neglecting repair of barracks<lb/>
building an <hi>elaborate</hi> (that's the<lb/>
very word used, my dear boy,) cons-<lb/>
stable, (<hi>Hesche</hi>!) lending government<lb/>
property, neglecting his duty, &amp; any-<lb/>
&amp; everything else you can think<lb/>
off- Only <hi>25</hi> witnesses! How?<lb/>
Well, &ldquo;I want to know&rdquo;! Now Camp<lb/>
Thomas may think, Dorsey, that it is<lb/>
<hi>quite</hi> a fine place, but it must<lb/>
yield the palm to Apache, <hi>this</hi> time,<lb/>
for having &ldquo;<hi>gone one better</hi>&rdquo;! I re-<lb/>
frain from expressing any opinion-<lb/>
Adrian waits at the door for this<lb/>
letter- I have written in the great-<lb/>
est haste, but if I haven't given<lb/>
you food for reflection for 15<lb/>
minutes, why, then I'm a liar-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Love to all - ever<lb/>
your friend,</salute>
