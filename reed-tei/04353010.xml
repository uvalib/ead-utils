Mrs. Arthur S. Griswold<lb/>
5015 Pon Valley<lb/>
Bloomfield Hills, Michigan<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs. Griswold:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I went to Europe late in September, came home for just a few days,<lb/>
during which time I was extremely busy and was not able to touch my cor-<lb/>
respondence, then went back to Europe again and have just returned home. I<lb/>
regret very much indeed that I have not acknowledged your kind letter of<lb/>
October 13 with your generous contribution of $25 to the Walter Reed Memorial<lb/>
Foundation.</p>
<p>At the moment there is actually no Walter Reed Memorial Founda-<lb/>
tion but there is a Walter Reed Memorial Association. I am Vice-President<lb/>
of the Board of Managers. The other members of the Board of Managers are<lb/>
distinguished and well-known Washington citizens. Two or three have been<lb/>
retired major generals, close friends of Walter Reed and the Surgeon General<lb/>
of the Army is also a member.</p>
<p>The fund is, at the moment, too small to accomplish much in the<lb/>
way of a memorial. The income from most of the fund has been used for a<lb/>
number of years to help support Walter Reed's widow who lived to the un-<lb/>
usual age of 90 and died just a few months ago. Her daughter, Blossom<lb/>
(Walter Reed's daughter) through these long years took devoted care of<lb/>
her disabled mother. There were many unusual expenses over a long period<lb/>
of years and most of the income from the Walter Reed Memorial Trust Fund<lb/>
is now being given to the daughter for her support. If one were to have<lb/>
asked Walter Reed &ldquo;How can we honor you, sir?&rdquo; I am sure that his first<lb/>
thought would have been for the comfort of his wife and daughter. That<lb/>
is what we have done to date. If and as the fund can be increased materially,<lb/>
we have hopes for some other type of a living memorial to Walter Reed.</p>
<p>I am sending your generous donation to Colonel Siler, the new<lb/>
President of the Walter Reed Memorial Association, who just took office<lb/>
on the death of the beloved General Jefferson Randolph Kean who was Walter<lb/>
Reed's right-hand man in Cuba and a very close friend of the Reed family<lb/>
through the years. May Colonel Siler and I assume that unless you let us<lb/>
hear otherwise, you approve my sending this check to him. But if you have<lb/>
some other thought in mind, we shall act accordingly.</p>
<p>Permit me to thank you also for graciously sending to me the<lb/>
most interesting book of the Washington murals. I am very glad to have<lb/>
this.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
