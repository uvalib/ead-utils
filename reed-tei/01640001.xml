<salute>My dear, Sweet Em.;</salute>
</opener>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Am I still your debtor,</l>
<l>In neglecting to write my rhyming letter?</l>
<l>Well, Alas! it is a crying shame,</l>
<l>That I should thus disgrace my name!</l>
<l>Really, my darling, I am afraid you'll say,</l>
<l>That my greatest strength <hi>lies in delay</hi>.</l>
<l>But listen a moment, while I relate</l>
<l>The cause of my unfortunate state.</l>
<l>Perhaps, when the reason shall appear,</l>
<l>You'll be inclined to drop a tear</l>
<l>Over the luckless effort of one,</l>
<l>Who was cheering his heart with a little fun.</l>
<l>Give ear:- I had taken my quill,</l>
<pb n="2" id="f01640002"/>
<l>And gone to work with a right good will.</l>
<l>My fingers were nimble, my heart was light,</l>
<l>My head was as clear as the day was bright.</l>
<l>In fact, I do not think there was ever given</l>
<l>To mortal a more propitious Heaven.</l>
<l>I had flattered myself that this letter in rhyme</l>
<l>Should contain the lore of every clime:</l>
<l>That in a lofty style it should be writ,</l>
<l>Full of learning, thought &amp; wit!</l>
<l>I had <hi>hoped</hi> to equal the <hi>great Mr Hannon</hi></l>
<l>When firing off his biggest cannon-!</l>
<l>(I trust, since you've accorded <hi>him</hi> so much praise,</l>
<l>You'll not be surprised, if <hi>I</hi> ape his ways).</l>
<l>Alas! how little we mortals know</l>
<l>Concerning our future joy or woe!</l>
<l>It seems 'tis Heaven's kind decree,</l>
<l>That the mind of man should ever be free</l>
<l>From all impending calamity;</l>
<l>Lest, indeed, suspense like this</l>
<l>Should rob his soul of all its peace.</l>
<l>Be this as it may, I'll not complain</l>
<pb n="3" id="f01640003"/>
<l>Of what was meant to be <hi>my</hi> <del>m</del> gain.</l>
<l>Still, occassionally, to look into dim distance</l>
<l>Would be of very material assistance.</l>
<l>As in this case, it alone could save</l>
<l>My effort from an early grave.</l>
<l>But I'll hasten on, nor longer wait</l>
<l>To disclose to you my unhappy fate.</l>
<l>I had progressed well to the forty-fifth line,</l>
<l>When lo! <hi>my muse</hi> began to pine!</l>
<l>And, in spite of<del>f</del> all that I could beg,</l>
<l><hi>She wouldn't move another peg</hi>!</l>
<l>While I pondered what I should do,</l>
<l>She stretched her wings &amp; upward flew;</l>
<l>Nor did she cease her sudden flight,</l>
<l>Till she had gained a mountain's height,</l>
<l>Which, rising from a lowly bed,</l>
<l>Raised on high its lofty head.</l>
<l>There, seated on an azure peak,</l>
<l>This silly Goddess refused to speak!</l>
<l>You may know, from the way my muse had acted,</l>
<l>That I had gone well-nigh distracted;</l>
<pb n="4" id="f01640004"/>
<l>So to propitiate a Being so fair,</l>
<l>I addressed to her the following prayer;</l>
<l>I homage pay from morn till night,</l>
<l>But still thou dost refuse;</l>
<l>Oh! come &amp; touch my feeble sight,</l>
<l>Thou song-inspiring muse!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>If thou but teach me how to sing,</l>
<l>A lay full soft &amp; sweet,</l>
<l>The costliest treasures I will bring</l>
<l>And cast them at thy feet.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>My hand, my heart, my life I'll bring,</l>
<l>And give them all for Thee;</l>
<l>Nor cease my grateful tongue to sing</l>
<l>What Thou host done for me.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Nor deem that I have scarce begun,</l>
<l>Thy kindness to repay,</l>
<l>Till all the nations, one by one,</l>
<l>Confess thy gentle sway.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But if thou dost my proffers spurn,</l>
<l>Nor stoop thy smiles to show,</l>
<l>My love for thee in vain shall burn,</l>
<l>My hopes lie scattered far &amp; low!</l>
<pb n="5" id="f01640005"/>
<l>Now, my darling, I'll leave it to your good sense,</l>
<l>If my prayer didn't deserve <hi>some</hi> recompense.</l>
<l>But will you believe it? (<hi>Sure</hi> I <hi>must weep</hi>)</l>
<l>The heedless Goddess had fallen asleep!!</l>
<l>Beholding this, I threw down my pen,</l>
<l>And declared I'd never <add>try r</add>hyming again!</l>
<l>Oh! is it not 'nough to break the heart,</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>When we endeavour to act our part,</l>
<l>(As best we can); to be rejected,</l>
<l>And that, <del>the,</del> by those we had least expected!</l>
<l>Ah! at such a time to feel alarm,</l>
<l>Removes from life its sweetest charm!</l>
<l>Compels our wounded souls to fly,</l>
<l>And seek for balm beyond the sky!</l>
<l>Yet, after waiting an hour <add>or</add> two,</l>
<l>I felt the spell of the breeze that blew,</l>
<l>Into my window &amp; oe'r my brow,</l>
<l>And concluded to break my foolish vow.</l>
<l>If the Goddess wouldn't condescend</l>
<l>Neither her prescence <add>nor smiles</add> to lend;</l>
<l>Why then, not meaning, at all, to flout her,</l>
<l>I'd simply get along -- without her.</l>
<pb n="6" id="f01640006"/>
<l>I'll only make this one request;</l>
<l>If my letter should lack or spirit or zest,</l>
<l>That you'll remember, as it little avails</l>
<l>A vessel to move without her sails,</l>
<l>So in rhyming, though such we choose,</l>
<l>'Tis hard to move without the muse!</l>
<l>But to my letter, &amp; <del>away</del><add>with</add> the muse away!</l>
<l>And first, let me tell the events of the day.</l>
<l>Yesterday, I went to that great City,</l>
<l>Where there's so much wealth &amp; so little pity,</l>
<l>(My previous attempts to go were in vain,</l>
<l>Owing to the fall of a very heavy rain)-</l>
<l>Where as many houseless men are seen,</l>
<l>As blades of grass upon the green;</l>
<l>Where old age &amp; youth, all, breathless follow,</l>
<l>To grasp &amp; hold the glittering dollar;</l>
<l>Where no man cares a fig for a friend,</l>
<l>Unless he has, <add>perhaps,</add> a penny to lend!</l>
<l>On reaching this city, I turned my looks</l>
<l>To D. Appleton's, who deals in books.</l>
<l>My intention was to give a start</l>
<pb n="7" id="f01640007"/>
<l>To that very lazy &ldquo;Journal of Art-&rdquo;</l>
<l>The clerk I saw gave no good cause</l>
<l>For the Journal's recent protracted pause;</l>
<l>And kindly promised, without delay,</l>
<l>To send it merrily on its way.</l>
<l>From the look I gave him, (one <hi>fearless</hi> &amp; <hi>stern</hi>),</l>
<l>I think, in the Future he'll better learn,</l>
<l>And hence deprive you of the occassion</l>
<l>Of inflicting on me another abrasion.</l>
<l>When to this matter I had duly seen,</l>
<l>I went to the office of the &ldquo;Sewing Machine&rdquo;,</l>
<l>Where I warmly grasped &amp; shook</l>
<l>The hand of my good friend, Mr Cooke.</l>
<l>He greeted me with as kindly a glance,</l>
<l>As if I'd been the King of France,</l>
<l>And, remarking that I looked thinner,</l>
<l>Compelled me to go with him to dinner.</l>
<l>I concluded to take a &ldquo;bite &amp; sip,&rdquo;</l>
<l>Just by way of old friendship.</l>
<l>So together we crossed the River,</l>
<l>And soon were dining on &ldquo;bacon &amp; liver.&rdquo;</l>
<pb n="8" id="f01640008"/>
<l>Our luncheon o'er, I bade him &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo;,</l>
<l>And left one tear in his hazel eye.</l>
<l>(In order that you may not be mistaken,</l>
<l>I'll tell you 'twas due to <hi>pepper</hi> &amp; bacon.)</l>
<l>Having to some other matters hastily attended,</l>
<l>To Willet's Point my course I wended.</l>
<l>The hour was such as one for contemplation best,</l>
<l>Just when the Setting Sun had tinged the golden West.</l>
<l>And there I found your very sweet letter.</l>
<l>Of <hi>four full</hi> pages &amp; a little better.</l>
<l>I tell you, it set my head in a whirl</l>
<l>To get <del>so</del> <add>a</add> long <del>a</del> letter from my little girl.</l>
<l>Still, I confess, I would have blessed my fate,</l>
<l>If the five had <add>only</add> been lengthened <del>and</del> to eight.</l>
<l>(Of course, this is not meant to suggest,</l>
<l>As in such matters, you know what's best)</l>
<l>But bless my soul! How I felt bereft,</l>
<l>When you spoke of the way in which I'd &ldquo;left.&rdquo;</l>
<l>As in leaving, I displayed &ldquo;no emotion&rdquo;,</l>
<l>Of course, I disclosed my <hi>pretended</hi> devotion.</l>
<l>And for a lady so thoroughly schooled</l>
<l>'Twas annoying, indeed, to be thus fooled.</l>
<pb n="9" id="f01640009"/>
<l>What, than all else, surprised me more</l>
<l>Was that you had failed to see <add>this</add> before.</l>
<l>Wasn't it the plainest thing to see</l>
<l>That there was <add>naught</add> <del>nothing</del> but <hi>coldness</hi> in me!</l>
<l>And how could you fail to know</l>
<l>That <hi>my</hi> heart was never above zero,!</l>
<l>Or could think that I cared at all,</l>
<l>For any girl on this round ball!</l>
<l>In sooth, woman's <hi>simplicity</hi> will ever be</l>
<l>To man the <add>one,</add> great<del>est</del> mystery-</l>
<l>But permit me to offer a little suggestion,</l>
<l>Which may aid in solving this very dark <add>question.</add></l>
<l>(If with my words you don't agree,</l>
<l>Imagine I'm talking to some other lady.)</l>
<l>&ldquo;Now, my dear, if you prefer a blaze to a cinder,</l>
<l>Don't turn your <hi>face</hi> full to the <hi>window</hi></l>
<l>When you are parting with your lover,</l>
<l>Or else, perhaps, <hi>he</hi> may discover</l>
<l>Of emotion an apparent lack</l>
<l>In the lady who turns upon him <hi>her back</hi>&rdquo;!</l>
<l>But truly, my darling, all joking aside,</l>
<pb n="10" id="f01640010"/>
<l>For once, you've missed the mark <hi>very wide</hi>;</l>
<l>Since in parting with you I surely cried,</l>
<l>And <hi>left you abruptly my tear to hide</hi>-</l>
<l>Satisfied of this, I think its about time</l>
<l>To bring to an end this <hi>wretched</hi> rhyme.!</l>
<l>I'm sure you'll not ask me to repeat it again,</l>
<l>And hence my effort has not been in vain.</l>
<l>In Conclusion, allow me to emphasize,</l>
<l>That you<del>'ll</del> <add>will</add> show this to no other eyes:</l>
<l>(The very thought that perhaps you will,</l>
<l>Makes me feel a decided chill!)</l>
<l>However much, others may assail you,</l>
<l>Do <hi>you alone</hi> weep over my failure.</l>
<l>Finally, as the vine clings to the tree,</l>
<l>So clings my heart to &ldquo;my little B-&rdquo;</l>
<l>Though the waves beat high on the storm-beaten</l>
<l>rock,</l>
<l>Our love, my precious, shall ne'er feel</l>
<l>the shock,</l>
<l>Nor shall our hearts in the least e'er</l>
<l>alter,</l>
<l>Nor I cease to be <hi>your own</hi>, <hi>fond</hi></l>
