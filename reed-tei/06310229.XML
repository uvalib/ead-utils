ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
145 LAUREL STREET<lb/>
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA<lb/>
<dateline>
<date value="1942-12-17">Dec. 17&sol;42</date>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have delayed answering your<lb/>
letter, which came on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, with the<lb/>
expectation that I would have some news<lb/>
from Harpers. As I wrote you in my<lb/>
last letter, I wrote Mr. MacGregor to advise<lb/>
me re the illustrations they wanted to eliminate.<lb/>
On Dec 3, his secretary wrote that he was<lb/>
away for a week and would take up my<lb/>
correspondence later. She also stated<lb/>
that the mms. had arrived. I expect that<lb/>
several people have to be consulted,<lb/>
and that takes time. I should hear something<lb/>
soon, I think. In fact I think I will<lb/>
hold this until the Sat. a.m. mails are delivered<lb/>
and then forward this so you will get it<lb/>
on Monday with the last word from Harpers if any.</p>
<p>I was dreadfully sorry I could not be<lb/>
at the Military Surgeons<unclear><del>'</del></unclear> Luncheon last Tuesday.<lb/>
Kean &amp; Russell are the two best friends<lb/>
I had in the Corps. I also knew Admiral Stitt<lb/>
<del>too</del>, and the selection of those three for the<lb/>
honors meets my hearty approval. I wish<lb/>
you could have known Kean in his younger<lb/>
days. A truly wonderful fellow.</p>
<p>Re. my story I feel that I have a mass<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06310230"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
2<lb/>
of information which should not be lost, but<lb/>
I fully realize that my inexperience in<lb/>
writing will be promptly recognized by<lb/>
literary critics. My own estimate is that<lb/>
the first half of the book will be interesting<lb/>
but the last part is not so well done and<lb/>
much of it probably should have been omitted.<lb/>
However, I could not do that over without<lb/>
a secretary. Too much work. I suppose<lb/>
there will be many criticisms, too, of the<lb/>
statements made, but I have done my very<lb/>
best to stick to things which I believe<lb/>
are true. How the Cubans will react<lb/>
I do not know. On the whole they will<lb/>
like the story but will find much to take<lb/>
exception to about Finlay &amp; Agramonte. On<lb/>
those points I know that I am right. <del>As<lb/>
you</del>As I have written you many times,<lb/>
you will uncover enough about Agramonte<lb/>
in time to find that I am right about<lb/>
him. Agramonte's letters to Mrs. Lazear, which<lb/>
you told me about, are terrible. I was so glad<lb/>
to find out why he was not at Lazear's funeral,<lb/>
and why he did not see Lazear when sick.</p>
<p>So you see I fully understood your remarks<lb/>
about criticisms I will get. I appreciate<lb/>
your estimate of the story and when I am<lb/>
too old &amp; feble to answer the critics you<lb/>
will have to come to my defence. I think<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06310231"/>
<hi>3</hi><lb/>
time will help to convince you that there<lb/>
are not many errors in my statements.<lb/>
I found it awfully hard to write about<lb/>
myself, but I simply could not have<lb/>
qualified as an author on the work done<lb/>
by the Reed Board without showing my background.<lb/>
I was really <add>quite a</add> live wire at the time I was<lb/>
in Cuba; was into everything; knew what<lb/>
was going on; and had friends. Fortunately,<lb/>
my memory is good and has been kept active<lb/>
in the Cuban experience by constant demands for<lb/>
info. re that period. So it had to be done in<lb/>
that way. Some will condemn me for that.<lb/>
However, who cares, if I have added anything<lb/>
to the historical data on that great work.</p>
<p>Thanks for the photos. The one of you and<lb/>
Mrs Hench is excellent. It was also nice<lb/>
to know about your kiddies and the expected<lb/>
one. Mrs Truby &amp; I have had four and<lb/>
the youngest one <add>(Jack)</add> was 15 years younger<lb/>
than the youngest of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> three. So if<lb/>
you are having a thrill after 9 years,<lb/>
imagine what a <hi>thrill</hi> we had -<lb/>
Jack has surprised us at West Point by<lb/>
bring no. 30 <add>from the top</add> in Math, in a plebe class of 1055.<lb/>
He was not quite 18 when he entered there<lb/>
last July. He is also on the A. squad in<lb/>
swimming, something no plebe has ever<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06310232"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
4.<lb/>
accomplished before. He is over 6 ft tall<lb/>
and a fine physical specimen. I tell you<lb/>
all this so you will be prepared for a<lb/>
very fine specimen in <hi>your old</hi> age.<lb/>
I hope you like a little kidding! I always<lb/>
enjoy it and have been blessed with<lb/>
a good sense of humor. It makes life<lb/>
worth living.</p>
<p>Congratulations on your award by the<lb/>
Heberden Society. That is a real honor.</p>
<p>If you ever come out here bring that<lb/>
picture of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Div. Hospital and we will<lb/>
see if we cant orient things. I haven't<lb/>
a copy of that photo. If we can locate<lb/>
the tree by Lazear's house it would help.<lb/>
If someone can pick out the N and South<lb/>
line from the shadows it would help.<lb/>
As I remember it, the picture was taken in<lb/>
April at which time the <add>noonday</add> sun, in that latitude,<lb/>
should be almost overhead I think. A real<lb/>
navigator could probably locate the true N. from<lb/>
something in the picture. It was probably taken<lb/>
during the lunch hour as there is no sign of<lb/>
<del>f</del><add>l</add>ife as I remember the picture.</p>
<p>Sat morning - nothing from Harpers. Will<lb/>
advise you promptly when I hear from<lb/>
them. Merry Christmas to you &amp; yours</p>

<salute>Sincerely</salute>
