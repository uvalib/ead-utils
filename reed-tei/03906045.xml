<pb n="1" id="f03906045"/>
<p>Dr. Walter Reed was Professor of Bacteriology in the Columbian<lb/>
University (now George Washington University) from <unclear>1895</unclear> to 1901.<lb/>
He was Professor of Bacteriology and Pathology from 1901 to the date<lb/>
of his death.</p>
<p>In 1897-98, I was a student in this medical school and attended<lb/>
Dr. Reed's lectures and laboratory course.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed was never late in meeting the students. His attire was<lb/>
conservative but immaculate. While addressing the class he <unclear><del>walking</del></unclear><lb/>
slowly before the students and spoke with great clarity, precision<lb/>
and force. His lectures were models in English and his scientific data<lb/>
were assembled in perfect order. There was nothing of the dramatic in<lb/>
his speech or manner, but he impressed one with his earnestness,<lb/>
thoroughness, and mastery of his subject.</p>
<p>He was<lb/>
never in<lb/>
<unclear>uniform.<lb/>
c. s. w.</unclear></p>
<p>After graduation I <unclear>spent</unclear> several hours three times each week as<lb/>
a demonstrator in Dr. Reed's laboratory in the medical school.<lb/>
Dr. James Carroll was assistant professor and did most of the routine<lb/>
work with several helpers, but rarely or never took Dr. Reed's place<lb/>
as a lecturer. Dr. Carroll was just a swell laboratory man and lacked<lb/>
the personality, culture and background of Dr. Reed. To be frank,<lb/>
Dr. Carroll was a bit crude and had a vocabulary of profanity that<lb/>
would be the envy of any sailor. Withal, he was kind, industrious, and<lb/>
always willing to lend a hand to any student in difficulty with his<lb/>
slides.</p>
<p>My recollection of Dr. Reed's operation is about as follows:<lb/>
Dr. J. Wesley Bovee, a classmate of Dr. Borden, requested me the day<lb/>
before the operation to give the Nitrous-Oxide Ether anesthesia.<lb/>
I had been Bovee's interne two years and had given many anesthetics for<lb/>
him, - consequently the call.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03906046"/>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>I went to the Washington Barracks, to the Army Hospital, the morning<lb/>
of the operation and was taken to the operating room where I saw Dr. Reed<lb/>
on the table. I assembled my apparatus - the Bennett inhaler and the tank<lb/>
of Nitrous Oxide and ether can - and asked Dr. Reed if he had any false teeth.<lb/>
He answered with a decisive &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We had hospital stewards all about, Major Borden and several spectators,<lb/>
one of whom was Major Kean, I believe, and probably Dr. Bovee. Dr. Reed<lb/>
took the anesthetic quietly and well. The appendix was gangrenous and<lb/>
what impressed me was the necrotic condition of the cecum, in which was a<lb/>
gaping hole as the appendix was removed. I recall with vividness that<lb/>
efforts to close the opening was met with little success, as each time<lb/>
a suture was placed in the wall, the catgut would tear out when the edges<lb/>
of the opening in the colon were approximated. This was repeated several<lb/>
times with indifferent results.</p>
<p>I never saw Dr. Reed later, but his condition was reported by Major<lb/>
Borden daily and it was evident that he died from peritonitis in about<lb/>
six days after the operation.</p>
