<p>McCoy thanks Hench for detailing his latest trip to Cuba. He informs Hench that Wood's daughter will not allow him to study her father's papers until she has had time to arrange them. He confirms the account of the Sternberg-Wood incidents as described in Hagedorn's biography of Leonard Wood.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you so much for giving me the whole history of your<lb/>
recent visit to Cuba, with its most interesting incidents, so<lb/>
pertinent to our common effort to interpret the background<lb/>
interestingly and accurately. I congratulate you on your accomplish-<lb/>
ment in that respect in such a short time. The &ldquo;mana&ntilde;a por la mana&ntilde;a&rdquo;<lb/>
habit does not seem to have hindered you much.</p>
<p>I am obliged to be away today but I shall hope to see you tomorrow,<lb/>
at least at the evening session, to which I am invited. However, if<lb/>
you should find time to get in touch tomorrow I shall be in my office<lb/>
all day.</p>
<p>In reply to your query about access to General Wood's diary, I<lb/>
am sorry to tell you that I have been unable to arrange that with Miss<lb/>
Wood. Until I heard from you I thought that the letter I sent to her<lb/>
for her signature, giving you access to the diaries at the Congressional<lb/>
Library, was in your hands. After receiving your letter I called Miss<lb/>
Wood on the telephone and I find that she will not permit anybody to see<lb/>
the papers until she has had time to rearrange them, abstract the personal<lb/>
letters and prepare the diary for easy scrutiny. She tells me that they<lb/>
are in a terrible mess and that she has been trying to get down all spring,<lb/>
especially since my letter to her, which remained unanswered, to make it<lb/>
possible for acceding to your request. She has been ill and still is and<lb/>
has not been able to help out, but she promises to do so in the near<lb/>
future.</p>
<p>Thank you for the funny old photographs taken in General Scott's<lb/>
office, of the General with Steinhardt the Chief Clerk and myself, the<lb/>
ghostly white figure. As to the furnishings in the State reception room<lb/>
of the Palace, as we called it, the whole room is quite changed from the<lb/>
Spanish period which still persisted during the American occupation. At<lb/>
that time the room was a very stately room in white panelling, with<lb/>
Italian ceilings and old-fashioned crystal chandeliers. The only touch<lb/>
of what might be called gorgeousness, in contrast to the simplicity of<lb/>
the room itself, was that of the French furniture done in red brocade, and<lb/>
the corresponding red brocade hangings. Over the windows were gold<lb/>
valances with the royal escudos of Spain, alternating with those of the<lb/>
City of Havana, so that the picture of today is completely different from<lb/>
that of the days of the American Military Government. That applies also<lb/>
to the<lb/>
Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>
Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota<lb/>

to the offices. The flooring in those days in all of the public<lb/>
rooms was of white marble, with black and white marble in the corridor<lb/>
around the courtyard.</p>
<p>As to your request for my remembrance of the Sternberg-Wood incidents,<lb/>
they are covered in the Hagedorn biography in the two or three references<lb/>
to the continuing fight against yellow fever throughout the pages having<lb/>
to do with General Wood's responsibilities as Governor General. Hagedorn<lb/>
was in touch with me during this research work on the Yellow Fever Board,<lb/>
as well as with Kean, Truby and other men then living, and my remembrance<lb/>
was better then than it is now, forty-six years after the incidents, so<lb/>
that I would prefer to stand as Hermann Hagedorn has quoted me. On<lb/>
page 281 of the first volume of his biography there is an important<lb/>
documentation referred to under &ldquo;15. Wood to E. F. Wood, Dec. 27, 1919.&rdquo;<lb/>
That was a letter from General Wood to Eric Fisher Wood and I would assume<lb/>
was the basis for the account of the conquest of yellow fever given by<lb/>
Eric Fisher Wood in his biography of Leonard Wood, which you have sent me.<lb/>
I agree with you, however, that the research should cover General Wood's<lb/>
diary at that period of 1900, and I shall hope to help you do that later<lb/>
on when Miss Wood has finished rearranging the files and the diary.</p>
<p>Your last question as to the building known as the Segundo Cabo, I<lb/>
can explain in this way:</p>
<p>In the days of the Spanish rule a Captain General was usually a<lb/>
military man. The Commander of the troops was usually the second in rank<lb/>
and acted for the Captain General in his absence. His official name was<lb/>
the &ldquo;Segundo Cabo&rdquo;, and his headquarters were in the building known as such.</p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
