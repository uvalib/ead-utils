<salute>Dear (Mis;) Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I ought not to write from Libau until I<lb/>
reach Berlin. Then I could tell you better about it.<lb/>
I reached it yester morning at 7.40 - although it<lb/>
was quite dark. It is also fairly dark by 4.30 P. M.<lb/>
It is not very cold - but freezing every night &amp; <hi>just</hi><lb/>
freezing during the day. I see no ice during the day<lb/>
but the thermometer registered 32&deg; the last two<lb/>
nights &amp; at 4. P. M today. It is <hi>cloudy</hi> with grey<lb/>
low hung clouds &amp; damp - <hi>raw</hi>, but not windy<lb/>
Particularly cheerless looking, &amp; yet, except that the cab<lb/>
men look cold, everyone else looks. I presume a-<lb/>
bout as usual. Not much expression in their faces,<lb/>
a rather hopeless, but not unhappy look.</p>
<p>I got on very well on the trip - 2 fairly <del>pleasant</del><lb/>
plesant companions, a German 35 years in En-<lb/>
gland - an art dealer - &amp; a German a very short<lb/>
time in England, but speaking some En-<lb/>
glish - <del>a decent</del> went with me from Hanno-<lb/>
ver - to Berlin - I <unclear>struck</unclear> the main line &amp;<lb/>
changed cars at Hanover. Had a decent night<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00750002"/>
in the &ldquo;schlaf-wagon&rdquo; - Berlin to Koningbeng.<lb/>
At the Russian Frontier it was a nuisance<lb/>
but only a nuisance - paid 75 cts to get out<lb/>
&amp; puzzled an English man by remarking<lb/>
that &ldquo;if that was all they wanted I would have<lb/>
paid 3 roubles&rdquo; - $1.50) &ldquo;not to have gone in&rdquo;.<lb/>
In attempting to explain to me that the 75 cts<lb/>
was possibly <hi>not</hi> the sole reason<del>s</del> for the<lb/>
<del><unclear>ex</unclear></del> customs inspection &amp; the Passport he rec'd<lb/>
<del>back</del><lb/>
another man's passport - Allison's, (his name<lb/>
was Atkinson) &amp; I left him stuggeling<lb/>
with that difficulty.</p>
<p>From the frontier on I shared the compart-<lb/>
ment with a very pleasant Russian fami-<lb/>
ly - a Vice Admiral, who was at Port Arthur<lb/>
in the beginning of the war - his wife &amp;<lb/>
daughter. The latter two spoke English<lb/>
&amp; the Admiral French, so we had a<lb/>
very interesting time. I was able to<lb/>
keep anyone else out of their compart-<lb/>
ment - <unclear>on</unclear> 4 allowed in - until about 9.40<lb/>
o'clock - when I left it to take the Libau train<lb/>
&amp; it was so late then that there was an ex-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00750003"/>
cellent chance that they had it to them-<lb/>
selves the balance of the night - to <hi>Riga</hi><lb/>
The had lived in Vladivostock - 2 1/2 years &amp; were de-<lb/>
cidedly interesting. The Old lady - who did most<lb/>
of the talking - was a decided &ldquo;reactionary&rdquo;<lb/>
&amp; told me with horror of the &ldquo;revolution&rdquo;<lb/>
as she called in in Kovno - the province then<lb/>
which we were passing &amp; in which her brother<lb/>
lived. The Daughter - not a young girl, but<lb/>
a very pleasant one &amp; whose precise, &amp; not<lb/>
always correct, English were a Joy to<lb/>
hear, was decidedly more liberal - as I<lb/>
think was her father. He said little on<lb/>
the subject however but to whom she con-<lb/>
tinually appealed as if he had been in<lb/>
the habit of agreeing with her. There was gen-<lb/>
eral agreement <add>however</add>, myself inclusive, to the<lb/>
old ladys statement that &ldquo;Russia was<lb/>
not yet ready to be a republic&rdquo; with<lb/>
which she appeared very well satisfied.</p>
<p><del>After leaving <unclear>Koshadang</unclear>-where</del> In my own com-<lb/>
partment - next to theirs, was a Russian who<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00750004"/>
spoke about as much German I do - unfortu-<lb/>
nately not <hi>exactly</hi> the same German - who<lb/>
was selling Typewriting machines - the<lb/>
<del>W W</del> Underwood - which he <unclear>prounced</unclear> with a &ldquo;<hi>W</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
He had been to Moscow &amp; to Oranburg &amp; had sold<lb/>
<hi>123</hi> this <hi>year</hi> ($140 to <del><unclear>$10</unclear></del> $187.50 a piece)<lb/>
Had sold <hi>5</hi> to the Bureau of Accounts of<lb/>
Russia - but had given them <del>"</del><hi>3</hi> years<lb/>
credit!! It was a machine which<lb/>
used Russian letters - of which there<lb/>
are either 32 or 36 - &amp; some remarkable<lb/>
ones two. He reminded me much<lb/>
of the Am. <unclear>Drummer</unclear> in &ldquo;the Shuttle&rdquo;<lb/>
&amp; we affiliated as much as the limited<lb/>
vocabulary we held in common al-<lb/>
lowed.</p>
<p>There was no light in the compartment - ex-<lb/>
cept one candle over the door - &amp; <hi>he</hi> had a<lb/>
small stock of candles, &amp; gave me one to give<lb/>
the ladies to take their tea by. They <del>thanked</del><lb/>
went over - the young one - &amp; thanked him &amp; they<lb/>
talked - (all three) as easily as if they had been of<lb/>
the same class. <del>you I it</del> It is like it was in<lb/>
Va. in old times. Class distinction is<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00750005"/>
H&ocirc;tel de St. Petersbourg<lb/>
LIBAU.<lb/>
clearly recognized that no attempt is made<lb/>
to preserve it - none being necessary. I said<lb/>
all three - the Admiral was out getting a reg-<lb/>
ular supper. On the whole it was a pleas-<lb/>
ant instead of a boring Journey, I take <hi>no-<lb/>
thing</hi> to read on the train with me as this<lb/>
keeps me looking at the country &amp; seeing<lb/>
people, &amp; I can read on my return. Probably<lb/>
however it will be advisable to buy a book - French<lb/>
for I will read it more slowly - for my sea trip<lb/>
back.</p>
<p>Now the last thing. I have bought - for <del><unclear>&amp; O. R.</unclear></del><lb/>
18 <unclear>Roubles</unclear> <add>=$9.00</add>- a Oranbourg shawl. It is an<lb/>
open-work all wool affair <hi>very</hi> fine &amp; pretty<lb/>
Far finer <add><del>than</del></add>- but <hi>not</hi> at pretty alas-as the Breton<lb/>
shawls at Cherbourg - It is a good big thing &amp;<lb/>
it will go through a finger ring - <hi>I saw<lb/>
him do it</hi>. I doubt if it has any warmth in it, it is<lb/>
too light &amp; probably is meant more for the head<lb/>
than to <hi>really</hi> wear. I got him for your mother<lb/>
<del>but</del> &amp; it will do if I no better can do - but I am<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00750006"/>
still on the look out for something for her<lb/>
at once pretty (artistic) &amp; useful - like<lb/>
the Breton shawls - This is <hi>distinctive</hi>-<lb/>
i.e. Russian - rather than very pretty or at all<lb/>
useful. <add>It is pretty same however from its finess.</add> I have to pay duty on all thing<lb/>
<del>not for <hi>personal</hi> wear</del> &ldquo;not personal wear-<lb/>
ing apparel or for personal adornment&rdquo;<lb/>
including &ldquo;presents to friends&rdquo; &amp; so I will<lb/>
declare it. My dealer said it would<lb/>
not be necessary as it could be worn<lb/>
under the shirt, or even in the hat if one was<lb/>
careful not to take it off or in an inside<lb/>
pocket!!</p>
<p>Also I lost my Cap = 50 cents: No sleepers on the<lb/>
train to Libau - but good long seats &amp; very comfort-<lb/>
able - I lay with it over my face - a very good night-<lb/>
&amp; when I woke up it had fallen off &amp; I forgot it.</p>
<p>I have lost only <hi>one</hi> umbrella the one I started with-<lb/>
since I have been over &amp; am going to try to hold<lb/>
on to my English one,- thought I had lost that<lb/>
yesterday but I had not.</p>
<p>I judge that I will leave Libau tomorrow night.<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f00750007"/>
3 days stay or Friday afternoon, then a<lb/>
few days in Berlin: 1 to 2 in Hamburg<lb/>
thence to Bremen - then report my work<lb/>
is done by cable &amp; then I expect - the N. D. Lloyd<lb/>
s. s. for N. Y - <hi>about</hi> the <hi>10</hi> may be the 14 th<lb/>
If I had a <hi>plenty</hi> of money I would ask<lb/>
for 14 days leave &amp; go to Italy &amp; see Geddings<lb/>
<hi>but</hi> <del>I</del> it is the <hi>cholera work</hi> at <hi>Naples</hi> I <hi>would<lb/>
go to see</hi> not <hi>Italy</hi>., so you have no excuse<lb/>
to advise me to do so anyway.</p>
<p>Good night - Love to your mother &amp; to Sally<lb/>
&amp; to the Heplers &amp; Dr <unclear>Ritter</unclear>. Why in<lb/>
the Deuce didn't you make up the ne-<lb/>
cessary &amp; appropriate messages to give the<lb/>
<unclear>H's</unclear> &amp; R. without awaiting them - They<lb/>
are sent in intention</p>
