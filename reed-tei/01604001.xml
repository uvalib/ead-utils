<p>The History of a Rose.</p>
<p>I wish I was a conspicuous<lb/>
flower said a delicate pink <del>R</del><add>r</add>ose<lb/>
to one of its companions <del>once</del>, why<lb/>
cannot I be admired as well as<lb/>
other flowers, and as it said so<unclear>,</unclear><lb/>
it grew pinker and pinker with<lb/>
envy. You would have thought that<lb/>
it would have been very contented<lb/>
in the little green house coverd with<lb/>
word bine and ivy and the sun<lb/>
casting its radient light upon<lb/>
the window, allthough it was<lb/>
not, I had rather live in the woods<lb/>
and be a wild Rose and be killed<lb/>
by the winter winds than to<lb/>
live in here and not be<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01604002"/>
noticed. I want to travel said<lb/>
the little Rose and live in a large<lb/>
house and have every body<lb/>
<hi rend="underline">admir<del>e</del>ing</hi> me and say, Oh, what<lb/>
a beautifull little flower, but as<lb/>
it is I have got to stay in here<lb/>
forever. It was very early the<lb/>
next morning when the gardener<lb/>
came to select the flowers to send<lb/>
to the city, after he had gatherd a<lb/>
few he came to the pink Rose,<lb/>
can it really be me thought<lb/>
the little flower, yes it was, so he<lb/>
took the Rose put <del>her</del><add>it</add> in the basket<lb/>
<del>to send</del> with the rest of the flowers.<lb/>
It was then a proud little thing<lb/>
it was now going to live in a<lb/>
place where flowers were scarce<lb/>
and there it would be called<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01604003"/>
<hi rend="underline">beautiful<del>l</del></hi>. While they were on there<lb/>
way the sun was very hot but<lb/>
the little Rose did not complain.<lb/>
At last the gardener sto<hi rend="underline">p<add>p</add>ed</hi> and<lb/>
a rich <add>lady</add> came out and of all of the<lb/>
flowers she thought the pink Rose<lb/>
the prettiest, she then carried it in<lb/>
the house and brought some water<lb/>
and watered it, Oh! how refreshed<lb/>
it felt, then it began to <unclear>rase</unclear> its<lb/>
little pink head, and <del>they</del> all<lb/>
exclaimed in one breath Oh! what<lb/>
a lovely little creature; I must<lb/>
send one of its buds to my<lb/>
sick friend said the lady,<lb/>
I know she would appreciate<lb/>
it, after a while <add>the</add> little pink<lb/>
Roses <del>had</del> faded and the lady<lb/>
was going to throw them a way<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01604004"/>
and her little girl said Mama<lb/>
give it to me, and the lady<lb/>
gave it to her not thinking what<lb/>
she was going to do with <add>it</add>, and<lb/>
when she asked the girl, she<lb/>
said wait and see Mama,<lb/>
and the next summer the<lb/>
little girl with a happy look<lb/>
carried her mama <del>the</del><add>to</add> see the<lb/>
Rose she was <hi rend="underline">su<del>p</del>prised</hi> <add> to see it</add>, and<lb/>
the child was still happier when<lb/>
she <del>pre</del> spyed a humming bird<lb/>
nest in one of its branches, the Rose<lb/>
was the child's delight until it<lb/>
was killed by a larg snow storm.</p>
<p><del>Written</del> Composed and written by<lb/>
Emily B. Lawrence during the<lb/>
session of 1867.</p>
