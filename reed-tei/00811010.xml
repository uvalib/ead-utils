Surgeon General,<lb/>
U. S. Public Health Service,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Referring to Bureau Letter of January 29/17 (<lb/>
relative to my appearing as a witness in a suit in which the<lb/>
Colleton Cypress Co. is involved, I would respectfully sub-<lb/>
mit that the ruling given in quotation marks in this letter--<lb/>
viz. &ldquo;It would not appear advisable that officers of the Ser-<lb/>
vice should be authorized or required to take steps to qual-<lb/>
ify as witnesses in particular cases&rdquo;--does not specifically<lb/>
apply in this case. I do not think that there is any ques-<lb/>
tion of my making any examinations or surveys so as to <hi>qual-</hi><lb/>
<hi>ify</hi> myself as a witness in this suit. The season of the year<lb/>
forbids. I have already visited the general locality (Febru-<lb/>
ary 1916) and advised what examinations should be made. I<lb/>
presume I am simply wanted to testify to such things as I am<lb/>
<hi>already</hi> qualified to do. It is not a case of <hi>qualifying</hi> as<lb/>
a witness, but of testifying. Frankly, I doubt if my testi-<lb/>
mony would be specially important, except as an expert in the<lb/>
epidemiology of malaria.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00811011"/>
<p>2</p>
<p>No personal gain would accrue to me from testifying in<lb/>
this case, see my letter of Jan. 10, 1917, and my sole reas-<lb/>
on for wishing to comply with Mr. Bell's request is that I<lb/>
feel it an obligation to him to do so <hi>if it be practicable</hi>,<lb/>
on account of having visited the locality with him and ad-<lb/>
vised with him about it--the understanding then being that<lb/>
I would be willing to appear in court if practicable and it<lb/>
was judged desireable. It is in no sense an advantage to me<lb/>
to go as I need the time for other things.</p>
<p>There is one somewhat annoying<del>g</del> complication, however:<lb/>
The Surgeon General told me on January 18th., voluntarily,<lb/>
as I had not spoken on the matter, that someone had spoken<lb/>
to him about the Colleton case and that I could get leave<lb/>
of absence at the proper time and I had informed Mr. Bell<lb/>
of this before the receipt of Bureau Letter of Jan. 29/17.<lb/>
I will, however, now forward him a copy of your letter of<lb/>
Jan. 29th. for his information.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Respectfully,</salute>
<signed>Assistant Surgeon General</signed>.
