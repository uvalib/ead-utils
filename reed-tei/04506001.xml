General Albert E. Love<lb/>
2709 Wisconsin Avenue N.W.<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Love:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Due to a <unclear>regrettable</unclear> oversight on my part, I did not send to you the<lb/>
enclosures. I sent them out a little hurriedly as I have been having,<lb/>
the last two or three weeks, a rather voluminous and complicated correspondence<lb/>
with Doctor Nogueira. I would appreciate it greatly if you would review,<lb/>
or at least skim the enclosures at your earliest convenience and give me<lb/>
any suggestions that you might have. Yesterday I sent a cable to Doctor<lb/>
Nogueira asking specifically for a reply to my letters of July 7 and 26.<lb/>
I still have real hopes of hearing from him. (He may be away on vacation<lb/>
or he may be momentarily alone in his desire to make corrections, bucking<lb/>
the others on the committee.) I still have faith in him and do not at this<lb/>
time want to cross him up or &ldquo;get others into the act&rdquo; until he has had<lb/>
every opportunity to straighten matters out himself. After all, he more<lb/>
than any other man, has been responsible for the developments of the last<lb/>
three or four years in behalf of Camp Lazear.</p>
<p>However if we find that he cannot make the appropriate corrections and if<lb/>
we find that the Cubans plan to dedicate Camp Lazear with a new name, not<lb/>
only for the camp but for Reed's Building No. 1, then I certainly think<lb/>
that the American Embassy in Cuba and the Surgeon General himself should<lb/>
know of the matter. Perhaps the Surgeon General's military representative<lb/>
(I suppose he would be the Military Attache to the American Embassy there)<lb/>
could make some discrete preliminary inquiries and then act politely, but<lb/>
firmly, at the appropriate time. I am leaning heavily on you and Colonel<lb/>
Siler for your advice in this matter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the matter concerned, I have long planned to take a vaca-<lb/>
tion with my son and will be leaving Rochester on August 13 for Mexico;<lb/>
however I will only be gone about two and a half or three weeks and even<lb/>
from there I can write a few letters or send a few wires if necessary. I<lb/>
believe the dedication is not until the latter part of September on the<lb/>
occasion of the International Congress of Hygiene in Havana.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
