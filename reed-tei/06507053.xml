<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here is a simple letter of transmittal of that &ldquo;puzzle&rdquo; you so<lb/>
kindly put up to me. I have enjoyed this work very much for it<lb/>
made me get busy and study, and I have learned more out of the<lb/>
old Senate Document than ever<del>y</del>.</p>
<p>I am enclosing some of Tate's letters with this so that you can<lb/>
read his slant on my production. I hope it pleases you, but as<lb/>
I have said in one of my letters enclosed herewith, you can change<lb/>
this analysis of the story, in whole or in part, as you see fit.<lb/>
I have gone in to detail at times in order that everyone might<lb/>
understand the conditions thoroughly enough to appreciate my<lb/>
views on the matters discussed. I told Tate that possibly I had<lb/>
overplayed the checkbook notes. To me, it was quite remarkable<lb/>
to dig into (after fifty years) the things that happened at the<lb/>
Camp.</p>
<p>Tate dwells quite at length on the importance of &ldquo;Martinez&rdquo;. I,<lb/>
of course, knew nothing about him, but I have learned enough<lb/>
about him in digging into the Senate Document, to realize that<lb/>
he really was quite a favorite of Reed's. Whether Martinez was<lb/>
his middle name or not I do not know. As I have stated in the<lb/>
story, I could not find the name of Jose Fernandez anywhere in<lb/>
any of the books I have on the subject. I don't believe you will<lb/>
find it in the Senate Document - I failed to do so. But, what<lb/>
does it matter as long as we are giving Martinez (even though<lb/>
Martinez in his middle name) the credit for what that individual<lb/>
did?</p>
<p>The checkbook went off to you on June 24th by First Class Mail,<lb/>
Registered. I should have reached you by now. I hope it gets to<lb/>
you in good shape.</p>
<p>I have worked under considerable difficulties - first one thing<lb/>
after another, including physical therapy and the other things<lb/>
have to do although I have developed many of my muscles which had<lb/>
been washed out from my neck to my toes. I couldn't have done this<lb/>
at all if it hadn't been for my daughter's help.</p>
<p>Now, I am confronted with another thing which will bother me. Now<lb/>
that rent control is off, no one can tell how high rents will go.<lb/>
Of course, retired Army officers have a limit. However, I am not<lb/>
too hopeful that our landlord will be any too easy on an Army officer.<lb/>
I will let you know later how it turns out.</p>
<p>With this I think I had better sign off with the hope that this<lb/>
story will not reveal my age! I am going to have another birthday<lb/>
this month. Best wishes to you and yours,</p>
