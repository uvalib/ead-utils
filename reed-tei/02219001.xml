<p>Your<lb/>
sweet letter of the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
came yesterday noon -- and<lb/>
made me so happy to know<lb/>
that my darling oomsey<lb/>
was able to sit up a<lb/>
little bit, and to <hi>still enjoy<lb/>
her afternoon nap</hi>! When<lb/>
I got to where you said<lb/>
&ldquo;I must now take my nap&rdquo;,<lb/>
I said to myself, &ldquo;the Gout<lb/>
is subsiding, or hasn't been<lb/>
severe enough to interfere<lb/>
with that <hi>afternoon nap</hi>&rdquo;!<lb/>
When I hear that you no<lb/>
longer take any satisfaction<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02219002"/>
in that afternoon nap, <hi>then</hi><lb/>
I shall begin to feel uneasy!<lb/>
Another most excellent and fav-<lb/>
orable sign of your speedy<lb/>
recovery, lovie, dear, grows<lb/>
out of the following expres-<lb/>
sion, &ldquo;I would also like very<lb/>
much to have a nice little<lb/>
toddy&rdquo;! Ho! Ho! He! He! Ha! Ha!<lb/>
The <hi>old thirst</hi> beginning to<lb/>
<hi>return</hi>? Well! that is most<lb/>
<hi>interesting</hi>! I don't know<lb/>
just why, but this morning<lb/>
while still lying on my<lb/>
little bed, this went through<lb/>
my head; &ldquo;Pretty Miss <hi>Gout</hi>,<lb/>
was getting <hi>too stout</hi>,<lb/>
so she fell on her <hi>snout</hi>.<lb/>
And couldn't go <hi>out</hi>&rdquo;!<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02219003"/>
now what do you think<lb/>
of that, sweet jo<del>g</del>ygie? Wasn't<lb/>
that a very <add>pretty</add> rhyme to be<lb/>
running through your old<lb/>
Mr Man's head at that <add>hour</add><lb/>
of the morning? Plague<lb/>
take that old <hi>hot</hi> weather<lb/>
that was making my pret-<lb/>
ty Farmer-lady feel so<lb/>
very uncomfortable! We<lb/>
thought that you were<lb/>
having a blizzard up<lb/>
north -- we can't complain<lb/>
of the temperature here just<lb/>
now, as it goes to 86&deg; or<lb/>
thereabouts every afternoon,<lb/>
falling to about 70&deg; at night.<lb/>
It <hi>is</hi> warm here, especially<lb/>
from 10 a.m. to 3 P.M -- after<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02219004"/>
that hour it begins to get cooler,<lb/>
and the nights are all that<lb/>
one can desire, even to the<lb/>
use of a blanket drawn<lb/>
well up under the chin-<lb/>
I don't know anything about<lb/>
why Mr Darboy Reed doesn't<lb/>
stand any higher in his class,<lb/>
but I would be willing to<lb/>
bet that it was due to the<lb/>
<hi>number</hi> of <hi>points</hi> he made<lb/>
on his examination, and to no<lb/>
other fact- I suppose that he<lb/>
barely passed on several<lb/>
of his subjects- As he <hi>passed</hi><lb/>
and has his commission, he<lb/>
shouldn't worry about<lb/>
a little thing like that.<lb/>
The <hi>girls</hi> will love him<lb/>
just as <hi>hard</hi> as if he<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02219005"/>
passed at the head of his<lb/>
class! Of course, you like<lb/>
Dr Nash - everybody does -<lb/>
He says those pleasant things<lb/>
about me, because, like a<lb/>
sensible man, he knows<lb/>
that it will please you, and<lb/>
so, like a good doctor, he<lb/>
puts you in a more agree-<lb/>
able frame of mind- See,<lb/>
lovie, dear? You <hi>are</hi> a very<lb/>
sweet oomsey &amp; your mantee<lb/>
would like very much to<lb/>
assist Dr Nash in treating<lb/>
that precious lame &ldquo;footsey&rdquo;!<lb/>
I enjoyed Johnnie Moore's<lb/>
letter very much- I'll bet<lb/>
that those Black &amp; <unclear>Son</unclear> straw-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02219006"/>
berry plants are not worth<lb/>
a continental! Do I hear you<lb/>
say, &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;? Well, that's<lb/>
very true, my sweet joy, but<lb/>
let's wait and see how much<lb/>
fruit they have and how<lb/>
good it is- Perhaps this war-<lb/>
mer weather will enable them<lb/>
to take root- I am so glad<lb/>
that our trees arrived during<lb/>
a favorable spell of weather.<lb/>
That was quite lucky -- and<lb/>
if the winter is not a very<lb/>
severe one, they ought to do<lb/>
well and come out beautifully<lb/>
in the spring- I think that his<lb/>
last bill was reasonable<lb/>
enough, as indeed I think of all<lb/>
his bills <add>are</add>. He had worked<lb/>
more days on the other than<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02219007"/>
I had supposed- That made<lb/>
it alright- That fence will<lb/>
be a beauty when it is fin-<lb/>
ished, and will improve the<lb/>
looks of our darling little<lb/>
home very much- I so often<lb/>
think of that sweet little home<lb/>
and of the pleasant days we<lb/>
have spent there amongst<lb/>
the trees and stones. I intend<lb/>
writing to Mr Moore very<lb/>
soon. I think that he would<lb/>
appreciate a letter from<lb/>
me. How is my sweet baby<lb/>
daughter getting along with<lb/>
her studies? Did she get that<lb/>
letter with the dollar<lb/>
in it, that her father sent<lb/>
for being so smart at her<lb/>
books? She is a precious<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02219008"/>
sweet child, and Papa is so<lb/>
glad that mother got her<lb/>
that silk petty coat. Does<lb/>
Elizabeth pass Friday night<lb/>
with her occasionally? How<lb/>
is old Mr Doogy Johnson?<lb/>
Give him a chuck under his<lb/>
chin for his grand-pa-<lb/>
Good-night my sweet Joys --<lb/>
old Mr Mantee is now going<lb/>
to <unclear>know</unclear> in for a <hi>gentle snooze.<lb/>
Monday morning</hi> - <hi>26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>. I have<lb/>
only time to say Boo! Boo!<lb/>
to my sweet girls and to<lb/>
wish them all kinds of<lb/>
happiness &amp; health. The<lb/>
Postman is coming-<lb/>
Kisses &amp; love for my<lb/>
precious babies.</p>
