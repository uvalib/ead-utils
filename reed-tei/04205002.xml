Dr. H. R. Carter, Jr.<lb/>
1927 First Avenue North<lb/>
Birmingham, Alabama<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am writing a book on the conquest of yellow fever. I have spent<lb/>
considerable time collecting the data during the last 7 years, such time as<lb/>
my practice here at the Mayo Clinic will allow. I have visited Cuba three<lb/>
times, visited most of the surviving relatives of Reed and his various col-<lb/>
leagues and had indeed a most delightful experience. I have uncovered a<lb/>
mass of unpublished data and believe that my book will be the definitive<lb/>
one on the subject.</p>
<p>One of the parts of the story that is not quite complete is that of<lb/>
the connection between your father, Doctor Carter, and Walter Reed. I am,<lb/>
of course, aware of the great influence which your father's papers had on<lb/>
Lazear and Reed but I have been unable to determine what actual physical<lb/>
relationship there was between your father and the Army Commission. I have<lb/>
been unable to find out at what time in their work your father's work was<lb/>
called to the attention of the Army Board and whether it was called first<lb/>
to the attention of Lazear or Reed and by whom. In searching for data along<lb/>
this line, I discussed the matter at the last meeting of the Board of Managers<lb/>
of the Walter Reed Memorial Association, which meets annually in Washington,<lb/>
and of which I am a new member. Admiral Stitt is an old member of that Board.<lb/>
He gave me some useful hints and suggested that I get in touch with the rela-<lb/>
tives of your father. I did not know your address but have had some corres-<lb/>
pondence with Mr. H. C. Redd of Richmond, Virginia. I understand that there<lb/>
are three trunks of correspondence of your father. Mr. Redd has, I believe,<lb/>
made a very brief inventory of the trunks and believes that there may be in<lb/>
these letters much of medico-historical value. He told me frankly that he<lb/>
was afraid that <unclear></unclear> wouldn't have the time to go over these letters carefully<lb/>
in the near future, whereupon, I suggested another plan.</p>
<p>On three occasions, relatives of survivors have uncovered in attic<lb/>
or cellar, boxes of material which they did not personally have time to go<lb/>
over. Mrs. Walter Reed allowed me to take with me all the remaining material<lb/>
of her husband. So did Lazear's immediate relatives and so also did General<lb/>
Jefferson R. Kean of Washington, who was Walter Reed's right-hand man in Cuba.<lb/>
In each case I was allowed to have the material here at hand, to go over it<lb/>
carefully at leisure and make such notes and copies as seemed historically<lb/>
important. The material which the Lazear family loaned me contained hundreds<lb/>
of personal letters between Mrs. Lazear and Doctor Lazear's mother, etc. etc.<lb/>
Rest assured that all such personal data were respected and no copies were<lb/>
made, the original letters being carefully returned to Mrs. Lazear. In each<lb/>
instance, I first rearranged all the data in chronological sequence, then<lb/>
read it carefully, laying aside only those which were of importance either in<lb/>
giving an important date or illuminating the character of the writer, or be-<lb/>

cause of its medico-historical content. These latter letters were then care-<lb/>
fully copied in sequence; after which I returned not only the original letters<lb/>
to the owner, but in most cases was delighted to return typed copies of the<lb/>
letters temporarily bound in sequence for the convenience of the family.</p>
<p>Now, Doctor Carter, I am most anxious to show to the full the im-<lb/>
portance of your father's work in relation to the conquest of yellow fever.<lb/>
I know of no other way to show you my earnestness in this matter. If you<lb/>
have any question as to my purposes, I believe that Admiral Stitt would vouch<lb/>
for me fully. General Walter L. Reed, the son of Walter Reed, I also know<lb/>
quite well. Also Mrs. Blossom Reed, Walter Reed's daughter. Whatever help<lb/>
you can give me in this matter I will most sincerely appreciate.</p>
<p>By separate post I am sending you a reprint which I think may interest<lb/>
you.</p>
