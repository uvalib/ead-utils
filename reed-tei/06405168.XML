General Jefferson R. Kean<lb/>
2804 North Street, North West<lb/>
Georgetown, Washington, C. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have a letter from Mrs. Kissinger telling me a few details<lb/>
about the death of Mr. Kissinger. As I anticipated, in the letter she<lb/>
also brought up the matter of a pension. She states, &ldquo;We had supposed<lb/>
that I would get the same annuity. Well, it seems that such is not the<lb/>
case. I think you might help out by writing General Kean. All I want<lb/>
or ask is that they give me enough to pay hospital and funeral expenses,<lb/>
and that is little enough for one who suffered what he did. I am not<lb/>
very well____&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have, in recent years, not been too happy at receiving<lb/>
letters from the Kissingers as in almost every letter they would include<lb/>
a rather poorly disguised hint that they would be glad to receive money.<lb/>
I have no doubt that they have been under unusual expenses, but much of<lb/>
that expense was unnecessary. You will remember that you and I advised<lb/>
Mrs. Kissinger long ago to send Mr. Kissinger to an army hospital. They<lb/>
preferred to keep him at home for quite awhile, and I believe they had<lb/>
to have extra help. Certainly, Mr. Kissinger should have known the<lb/>
circumstances about his pension, and should have been preparing all these<lb/>
years for his death and <del>for the future care of</del> his wife. I think that<lb/>
she has several children. I believe they sold their Huntington home<lb/>
and bought a little house in Florida, so that she must have a little<lb/>
property. I do hope that she won't start a campaign that will embarrass<lb/>
you and me and his other friends. In answering her letter, I have<lb/>
urged that she write to Washington to find out the circumstances of his<lb/>
annuity. If she really is in need of money to pay funeral expenses,<lb/>
don't you suppose the local Red Cross or American Legion could come to<lb/>
her help? Between the importunings of Lambert and the Kissingers I get<lb/>
a bit weary at times; and, of course, if I feel that way, how much more<lb/>
must you have felt that way all these years. In my letter to<lb/>
Mrs. Kissinger, I tried to encourage her not to bother you, but I have<lb/>
no doubt that she will write to you in time.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
