<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>How glad<lb/>
I was to get your sweet<lb/>
letters of Tuesday and Sat-<lb/>
urday- And my darling<lb/>
wifie is really much<lb/>
better and able to get down<lb/>
stairs once more? How<lb/>
perfectly delightful! and<lb/>
how delighted I am to<lb/>
hear of it! You sweet,<lb/>
patient thing, what a<lb/>
seige of it you must<lb/>
have had! Now that you<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02224002"/>
begin to talk of your <hi>toe</hi>,<lb/>
I feel assured, too, that<lb/>
your attack was really one<lb/>
of gout- You've been living<lb/>
entirely <hi>too</hi> high, lovie, dear,<lb/>
and been consuming too<lb/>
many of the <hi>good</hi> things of<lb/>
this life! You will have<lb/>
to eschew juicy <del>steakes</del><lb/>
Steaks, welsh Rarebits,<lb/>
and Johannes Barley corn,<lb/>
and come down to milk,<lb/>
white meat, and succu-<lb/>
lent vegetables, such<lb/>
as grow in Keewaydin's<lb/>
terraced garden; or<lb/>
there will be more<lb/>
trouble in store for you.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02224003"/>
<hi>Eat</hi> but <hi>little</hi> and take<lb/>
<hi>lots</hi> of <hi>outdoor exercise</hi>,<lb/>
and <hi>look not</hi> upon the <hi>wine</hi>,<lb/>
these are to be the guiding<lb/>
principles of your future<lb/>
conduct! my! it strikes<lb/>
your old Mr Mantee that<lb/>
with dear aunt Jane's<lb/>
<hi>Eczema</hi> and your <hi>gout</hi>,<lb/>
the <hi>Mint-bed</hi> by the pump<lb/>
will run <hi>riot</hi>! Certainly<lb/>
precious silk petty-coat<lb/>
and I can never keep that<lb/>
mint properly nipped!<lb/>
what a joke on two large,<lb/>
fat, juicy ladies!- <hi>Eczema</hi><lb/>
and <hi>gout</hi>- Oh! how &ldquo;Tarantula<lb/>
Juice&rdquo; makes its devotees<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02224004"/>
<hi>uncomfortable</hi> at times! In-<lb/>
deed, precious Oomsey, I am<lb/>
so rejoiced to hear that<lb/>
you are so much better and<lb/>
free of pain- It made me<lb/>
sad to think of your lameness<lb/>
and confinement in-doors.<lb/>
But now that you can go<lb/>
to the matinee and have a<lb/>
quiet little chuckle, with<lb/>
those <hi>two first</hi>- <hi>class</hi>, <hi>chuck-<lb/>
-lers</hi>, Lucy and Blossom,<lb/>
I know that you will be-<lb/>
gin to take some com-<lb/>
fort in life- Of course,<lb/>
Miss Lucy was sweet<lb/>
and good to you, while <add>sick</add>,<lb/>
she couldn't be <hi>otherwise</hi>,<lb/>
even though she tried!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02224005"/>
What a comfort to have<lb/>
such dear, kind people to<lb/>
drop in &amp; add their mite<lb/>
to <hi>your</hi> comfort! It would<lb/>
have been strange if Dr<lb/>
Nash &amp; Carter hadn't ad-<lb/>
mired your bright, cosy<lb/>
room, all the brighter and<lb/>
more cheerful by the ar-<lb/>
tistic touch of sweet Miss<lb/>
Room-fixer. What has be-<lb/>
come of that precious<lb/>
daughter of mine, that she<lb/>
doesn't write to her father?<lb/>
stir her up a little, Mother<lb/>
dear- By the way, I enclose<lb/>
in this letter a check for<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>258.<hi rend="superscript">34</hi> which Beechner can<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02224006"/>
C1<lb/>
B9<lb/>
take to the Bank for you-<lb/>
<hi>You don't have to endorse<lb/>
it at<del>s</del> all</hi>- Be certain to<lb/>
give Beechner your depos-<lb/>
it-book- I will write to<lb/>
Mr Meyers, by this mail,<lb/>
to send Beechner over, &amp;<lb/>
you must give him 3 street<lb/>
-car tickets when he comes,<lb/>
so as to cover his car-<lb/>
fare in going to the bank<lb/>
&amp; returning- I have kept<lb/>
some cash for myself in<lb/>
case I should need it,<lb/>
my expenses have been very<lb/>
little since I came, &amp; they won't<lb/>
be much for this month- I<lb/>
hope that Johnnie Moore<lb/>
has finished his work<lb/>
at Keewaydin by this time.<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02224007"/>
How sweet in dear Mrs.<lb/>
Comp<del>f</del>ton to come to see you again,<lb/>
Give her my love &amp; to Mrs. Gor-<lb/>
don &amp; Halstead when you see<lb/>
them- As regard the outcome<lb/>
of our observations, I have<lb/>
thought very carefully over<lb/>
what the <hi>world</hi> would have<lb/>
to say, in case any very se-<lb/>
rious thing would happen-<lb/>
Already the spanish papers<lb/>
in Havana have called<lb/>
us &ldquo;<hi>Savages</hi>&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;<hi>Barbarians</hi>!<lb/>
I think that I wrote you<lb/>
concerning that, didn't I?<lb/>
The Spanish consul, however,<lb/>
a gentleman of sense, fully<lb/>
endorses our inoculations.<lb/>
But I am doing nothing<lb/>
for which we should be<lb/>
censured- No one is<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02224008"/>
subjected to any experiment,<lb/>
who does not give <hi>in writing</hi>,<lb/>
signed by himself, his freeest<lb/>
consent, &amp; after the <hi>full danger</hi><lb/>
has been explained to him-<lb/>
we have Dr Cooke &amp; two men of<lb/>
the Hospital Corps, now occupy-<lb/>
-ing the house that contains infected<lb/>
clothing- They went in on Friday<lb/>
evening, novr 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. I only re-<lb/>
quire them to sleep in this house.<lb/>
During the day, they occupy a<lb/>
large tent nearby their house.<lb/>
Last Tuesday three men -- one<lb/>
american &amp; two spaniards were<lb/>
bitten by infected mosquitoes-<lb/>
Friday morning, the american<lb/>
had slight fever &amp; headache<lb/>
which lasted all day- Today<lb/>
slight fever with dizziness-<lb/>
whether he will develope any<lb/>
further symptoms, I can't tell<lb/>
yet -- one spaniard has slight<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02224009"/>
fever, this afternoon, the other<lb/>
has none- Dr Agramonte ap-<lb/>
plied two <hi>better</hi> infected insects<lb/>
to each of the spaniards, this<lb/>
afternoon- I have one amer-<lb/>
ican &amp; two other Spaniards in<lb/>
camp, whom we shall inoc-<lb/>
ulate by bites within the<lb/>
next 6 days- we are now<lb/>
in much better shape to keep<lb/>
our mosquitoes alive at<lb/>
summer temperatures in a<lb/>
regularly prepared room<lb/>
properly heated- This<lb/>
room is located at our<lb/>
station- of course, Drs C.<lb/>
&amp; Agramonte superintend<lb/>
the infection &amp; raising of<lb/>
the insects entirely- I<lb/>
hatch out here larvae<lb/>
from the eggs of insects that<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02224010"/>
we catch here in the garrison<lb/>
where there is no yellow<lb/>
fever. So the work goes on.<lb/>
Of course, I am very anxious<lb/>
as to the outcome, but I am<lb/>
not worrying over what the<lb/>
world may say, as I feel<lb/>
that only good must grow <add>out</add><lb/>
of our work</p>
<p><hi>Monday morning - Dec. 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi></hi>- How<lb/>
are my sweet girls this beau-<lb/>
tiful morning? Still soundly a-<lb/>
-sleep, while papa is pen-<lb/>
ning these concluding words,<lb/>
I guess- well, asleep or awake,<lb/>
they are his precious<lb/>
babies- Give much love to<lb/>
Miss Lucy &amp; Mrs. Dorsey -- also<lb/>
to Miss Mason &amp; Miss Thompson-<lb/>
Regards to the others- You must<lb/>
make Ida a nice present- write<lb/>
often- Kisses &amp; love &amp; love &amp; Kisses<lb/>
for my darling children-</p>
