Mr. W. Edwin Hemphill, Editor<lb/>
VIRGINIA CAVALCADE<lb/>
History Division<lb/>
Virginia State Library<lb/>
Richmond 19, Virginia<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Hemphill:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just returned a few days ago from two weeks absence to find a<lb/>
letter either from you or one of your associates telling me about an<lb/>
article on the early life of Walter Reed which you were planning to<lb/>
publish in an early issue of the VIRGINIA CAVALCADE. I took the letter<lb/>
home the other evening and spent a couple of hours looking over my files.<lb/>
I was asked to suggest photographs. To make a long story short, I wrote<lb/>
down on the letter a number of suggestions and now I simply cannot find<lb/>
the letter. I do not recall whether the letter was from you or perhaps<lb/>
from Mr. Randolph W. Church.</p>
<p>In any event, I shall be glad to help as I can. I enjoyed reading the<lb/>
article but I must tell you that I have very little material which covers<lb/>
the boyhood of Reed. I imagine that the author of the article consulted<lb/>
Laura Wood's (Mrs. Laura Wood Roper) book on the life of Walter Reed.<lb/>
This covers his boyhood more thoroughly than any book I know. I do have<lb/>
in my possession the actual diploma which Reed obtained from the University<lb/>
of Virginia giving him his first M.D. degree. If you want a photograph<lb/>
of that I shall be glad to send one to you. Indeed I have all of Reed's<lb/>
diplomas, presented to my collection by the Reed family. I have a couple<lb/>
of photographs of Reed about the time of the yellow fever experiments<lb/>
and I have an original of the conventional photograph of Reed. None of<lb/>
these suit your purpose, I believe. There was published in 1926, I think<lb/>
by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, a series of pamphlets called<lb/>
&ldquo;Health Heroes Series.&rdquo; One of those pamphlets concerned Walter Reed.<lb/>
About five or ten years ago they made a film on this article and illustrated<lb/>
it with various photographs of Reed which I presume they obtained from the<lb/>
Reed family. There is one of Reed at the age of about three or four years<lb/>
I should judge; another of him at the age of 17; another about the age of<lb/>
24 and then later photographs. Since this film, I believe, was copyrighted<lb/>
by the insurance company, I could not send you my copies and give you per-<lb/>
mission to use them. I have no doubt you could get permission from the<lb/>
insurance company or get copies from the Reed family. It would be easier to<lb/>
get copies from the insurance company.</p>
<p>I enclose a reprint by Dr. Arthur C. Jacobson. <hi>Please return it</hi>. My con-<lb/>
tribution to this article was my letter which is published on pages 82 and 83.<lb/>
This gives the reference to Laura Wood's book.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M.D.</signed>

P.S.: Since dictating the above I have found the letter and the manuscript.<lb/>
The &ldquo;Health Heroes&rdquo; booklet was written by Grace T. Hallock and C. E. Turner.<lb/>
You do not want the booklet but you may want permission to use the boyhood<lb/>
pictures of Reed which the company used when they made the film on the matter.<lb/>
It is not an ordinary movie but a large number of single frames on a con-<lb/>
tinuous film (like a movie film) and used in a machine which projects each<lb/>
frame separately.<lb/>
I have pictures of the birthplace of Reed before and after it was fixed up.<lb/>
I also have in my possession Reed's famous New Year's Eve letter to his wife,<lb/>
New Year's 1900. I obtained from the National Archives a photograph of the<lb/>
oath of office which Reed signed on December 23, 1893. The U. S. Army Medical<lb/>
Museum has photographs of the bust of Reed: Ask for their negatives No.<lb/>
71649 to 61751.<lb/>
I think it would be nice to use a photograph of the Academy in Charlottesville<lb/>
where Reed went to school, also the house in Charlottesville where he lived<lb/>
with his family. My brother, at the University of Virginia, tells me that<lb/>
the house has been located and it is marked I believe.<lb/>
One point about the manuscript. On page 5 your writer says that Reed replied<lb/>
&ldquo;Gentlemen, I will hold you to your promise.&rdquo; Somehow I just can't swallow<lb/>
that. I can't imagine a 16 year old boy rather pompously challenging the faculty<lb/>
representative in that manner. This alleged quotation of Reed's, to me seems<lb/>
to be in a class with an even more famous supposed quotation which he is sup-<lb/>
possed to have made when Kissinger and Moran volunteered their services to<lb/>
him for the mosquito bites. Reed is supposed to have risen, saluted them and<lb/>
said &ldquo;Gentlemen, I salute you.&rdquo; I just don't think Reed was given to such<lb/>
heroics and as for the latter quotation, even though Kelly gives it in his<lb/>
book and it has been widely quoted, it is quite untrue. Actually Kissinger<lb/>
and Moran went to Reed separately and they have both told me most emphatically<lb/>
that no such remark was made to either. I would regard both of these quota-<lb/>
tions as candidates for that column which occasionally appears in The New<lb/>
Yorker Magazine, &ldquo;Quotations which We Believe Never Got Quoted.&rdquo;<lb/>
May I keep the manuscript? I assume it is merely a copy.<lb/>
