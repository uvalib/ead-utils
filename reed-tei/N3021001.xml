<p>THE EVENING SUN FORUM</p>
<p>Colonel Goethals Was Not Hampered<lb/>
By The Canal Commission.</p>
<p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EVENING SUN:</p>
<p>Sir--Just to correct a minor error in<lb/>
the article on Colonel Goethals in THE<lb/>
EVENING SUN of today.</p>
<p>The praise given Colonel Goethals for<lb/>
his work is indeed due. The statement<lb/>
that the men on the canal--I mean the<lb/>
men working on the Isthmus--were<lb/>
working half-heartedly or were doubtful<lb/>
of success before the Colonel arrived is,<lb/>
however, I think, erroneous.</p>
<p>The writer's appointment to the Isth-<lb/>
mus bears date of June 1, 1904, and he<lb/>
went down on the ship with Mr. Wallace<lb/>
and Colonel Gorgas, to whose depart-<lb/>
ment he was attached. He remained on<lb/>
the Isthmus until the latter part of<lb/>
1909. During the first few years--and<lb/>
it was in these that the stress of the<lb/>
service fell--there were very few white<lb/>
men, Americans, on the Isthmus whom<lb/>
he did not know, and, when we were<lb/>
few, as at first, just to be an American<lb/>
was to be a friend; and we knew each<lb/>
other very well. He thinks, then, he<lb/>
can tell what was the feeling among the<lb/>
American employes on the Isthmus.<lb/>
What those in Washington thought he<lb/>
does not know.</p>
<p>There was some yellow fever in 1905,<lb/>
especially in May and June--not a great<lb/>
deal, but it was fairly fatal--and from<lb/>
some departments there was quite an<lb/>
exodus from the Isthmus in May and<lb/>
early June. There was none from our<lb/>
department; it winnowed out trifling<lb/>
men, and this was probably an advan-<lb/>
tage.</p>
<p>Among the men who stayed (and not<lb/>
many left, and of the great bulk of the<lb/>
men who came down I can speak with<lb/>
some knowledge) there was never any<lb/>
doubt about completing the canal; not<lb/>
any shadow of doubt. We knew we<lb/>
would build it if we held on, and we<lb/>
knew we would hold on.</p>
<p>Yellow fever disappeared for good in<lb/>
December, 1905, and there was never<lb/>
any more fear of it. Malaria was con-<lb/>
trolled, so far as Americans were con-<lb/>
cerned, by February, 1906, and for all<lb/>
by the end of the wet season of that<lb/>
year. After the above date, February,<lb/>
1906, then, there was no special sick-<lb/>
ness among the Americans and no fear<lb/>
of any.</p>
<p>Living conditions, which were some-<lb/>
what primitive in the beginning, were<lb/>
quite good, and the people were well sat-<lb/>
isfied when Mr. Roosevelt visited us in<lb/>
1906. They were good before Stevens<lb/>
left. They were improved by Colonel<lb/>
Goethals, as indeed they had been by<lb/>
Stevens during his incumbency.</p>
<p>Colonel Goethals came down, if I rec-<lb/>
ollect aright, in 1907. You imply that<lb/>
he had difficulty in getting what he<lb/>
wanted from the commission. This may<lb/>
have been, but it seems improbable, as<lb/>
he was chairman of the commission, a<lb/>
majority of which consisted of his three<lb/>
subordinate engineers, Gaillard, Sibert<lb/>
and Rousseau. Colonel Gorgas and Mr.<lb/>
Blackburn were two other members.<lb/>
The three engineers came down to the<lb/>
Isthmus with Colonel Goethals, and<lb/>
Gorgas was on the Isthmus at the time,<lb/>
having already been there over three<lb/>
years. This commission did not stay in<lb/>
Washington at all.</p>
<p>I am afraid that one sometimes makes<lb/>
a big thing smaller by claiming for it<lb/>
more than the truth.</p>
