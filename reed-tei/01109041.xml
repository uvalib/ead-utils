<salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>We arrived here yesterday, in the evening, June the thirteenth,<lb/>
after a delayed voyage from Baranquilla. We were delayed two days in<lb/>
Curacao, leaving there on Saturday, June the tenth, and arriving in Maracaibo<lb/>
Sunday, the eleventh. As we could not leave Maracaibo until the following<lb/>
Thursday, by the weekly mail boat, we chartered a small tug boat which took<lb/>
us to Encontrados. Leaving Maracaibo at one A.M. Tuesday, June the twelfth,<lb/>
we arrived at Encontrados Wednesday morning the Thirteenth. From Encontrados,<lb/>
due to the kindness of the President of the State of Zulia, a special train<lb/>
was put at our disposal to take us to Tachira Station, from whence we came<lb/>
to Cucuta in automobile.</p>
<p>This morning, in company of the Chief of Hygiene, we visited the<lb/>
hospital, which we found free from yellow fever or any suspicious cases.<lb/>
After we called on the Governor, in whose company we visited the Barracks<lb/>
infirmary, which we also found free from yellow fever or suspicious cases.<lb/>
From the report of several of the physicians, whom we met, and who were very<lb/>
cordial, we obtained the information that there were no cases in the city of<lb/>
a suspicious nature. On the other hand they informed us of the great inci-<lb/>
dence of stegomyia, a fact which we verified by personal observation.</p>
<p>When we called on the Governor we impressed the necessity of<lb/>
mosquito campaign, on account of the proximity to Bucaramanga, and of the<lb/>
danger of infection. At the request of the Governor, we agreed to sign a<lb/>
telegram to the National Chief of Hygiene, concerning the status of Cucu-<lb/>
ta, and our recommendation of a mosquito campaign. This telegram was a<lb/>
joint one to Dr. P. Garcia Medina, and Dr. F. A. Miller, and sent from the<lb/>
office of the Governor, after having been signed by Dr. W. Pareja and Dr.<lb/>
C. L. Pothier.</p>
<p>This completes our mission to Cucuta. We are leaving tomorrow<lb/>
afternoon, June the fifteenth, on our return to Maracaibo, and thence to<lb/>
Curacao, to take the earliest steamer to Colon, from which we respectively<lb/>
will return home.</p>

<p>In Maracaibo we were extended a courteous and cordial reception<lb/>
by the President of the State of Zulia, through the offices of Drs. Aranguren<lb/>
and Irarazabal, respectively Port Physician and Inspector of Customs, and<lb/>
the Secretary General of the State. After this cordial reception we sent<lb/>
a telegram of thanks to the President of the Republic which was duly acknow-<lb/>
ledged. Here in Cucuta the Governor and other officials, and physicians<lb/>
were cordiality itself.</p>
<p>Trusting that this report will meet with your approval, we wish<lb/>
to remain,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Respectfully,</salute>
