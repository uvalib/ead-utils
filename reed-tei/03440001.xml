Dr. Ralph C. <hi>Hutchison</hi><lb/>
Washington and Jefferson College<lb/>
Washington, Pennsylvania<lb/>
<salute>My dear Hutch:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you so much for sending me the various notes about<lb/>
Harriet. I have kept Dr. Logan informed, and we were delighted with<lb/>
the outcome.</p>
<p>I have been meaning to write you for a long time about<lb/>
my investigation of the yellow fever survivors who worked with Reed.<lb/>
I have had an interesting correspondence with the only two private<lb/>
soldiers who are still living and who worked with Reed, Carroll, and<lb/>
Lazear. As a matter of fact, I believe these two men are the only two<lb/>
survivors of the whole group. One is in Havana, the other is in Hunting-<lb/>
ton, Indiana. How are the plans for your celebration coming on? I had<lb/>
a letter yesterday from Mr. Kissinger, the first man to be given yellow<lb/>
fever. He is going to Florida for the winter, but expects to speak<lb/>
again on the radio the twenty-fifth of this month. I don't know what<lb/>
program. If you wish to know, I'll find out. This is the third time<lb/>
he has spoken on a national hookup regarding his yellow fever experiments.<lb/>
We are hoping to have him come here before or after his Florida trip to<lb/>
tell us about it. As I told you, he is not a polished speaker, and makes<lb/>
many mistakes in grammar, but has a most interesting story and is a<lb/>
nice short of a chap, very interesting to me. Neither Kissinger nor<lb/>
Moran have ever written up their own experiences. Both have given me a<lb/>
considerable amount of material and I hope to write them up and publish<lb/>
them under their own names and not mine. Their stories should be<lb/>
published in as near their own words as possible, in a medical historical<lb/>
journal.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
