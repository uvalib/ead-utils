<p>MOSQUITOES' DEADLY WORK.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Yellow Fever Spread Broadcast by<lb/>
Their Bite, Says a Son of<lb/>
Dr. Finlay.</p>
<p>Among the passengers who arrived from<lb/>
Havana on the Ward Line steamship Morro<lb/>
Castle yesterday was <hi>Dr. C. E. Finlay</hi>, a<lb/>
son of Dr. C. J. Finlay, the author of the<lb/>
theory that mosquitoes spread yellow fe-<lb/>
ver. Dr. Finlay, speaking of his father's<lb/>
work yesterday, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among scientists there is but little<lb/>
doubt now that yellow fever is spread by<lb/>
the common house mosquito, which be-<lb/>
longs to the species called Culex. These<lb/>
insects bite a person suffering from the<lb/>
disease and then inject the poison into<lb/>
some one else. In this way alone is the<lb/>
disease spread, and if the mosquitoes could<lb/>
be exterminated yellow fever would be at<lb/>
an end. The frost kills the mosquitoes in<lb/>
the South, and there is no yellow fever<lb/>
there until another crop of mosquitoes ap-<lb/>
pears. There are always cases of yellow<lb/>
fever in Cuba, and the insect, therefore, is<lb/>
able to find subjects from which they<lb/>
inoculate others with the poison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father, when he discovered that<lb/>
mosquitoes spread yellow fever, caught one<lb/>
of the pests, and after starving the insect<lb/>
for two days, allowed it to bite himself.<lb/>
This test, however, was not a good one, as<lb/>
he is an immune, and then the same test<lb/>
was applied to a subject who was sus-<lb/>
ceptible to the disease. The latter con-<lb/>
tracted the fever in this way, and then<lb/>
hundreds of similar experiments followed,<lb/>
and all the subjects developed yellow fe-<lb/>
ver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This clearly demonstrated the accuracy<lb/>
of the theory that yellow fever is not con-<lb/>
tagious, but is simply spread by mosquitoes<lb/>
just as malaria is spread by another spe-<lb/>
cies of mosquitoes that lives in the swamps.<lb/>
As soon as a culex has bitten a sufferer<lb/>
from yellow fever, the insect is caught and<lb/>
bottled for a couple of days, and then<lb/>
when hungry is put upon a subject. Dr.<lb/>
Lazier, one of the Yellow Fever Commis-<lb/>
sion, who died under the experiment, al-<lb/>
lowed himself to be bitten by five or six<lb/>
mosquitoes, and in that way got an un-<lb/>
usually heavy inoculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the experiments proceed, it is be-<lb/>
lieved that in time a virus obtained from<lb/>
either a patient or a culex will be pro-<lb/>
cured which, when modified, can be used<lb/>
as successfully as bovine virus is for small-<lb/>
pox. There are only four or five cases of<lb/>
yellow fever in Havana at the present time,<lb/>
but the season is on, and unless the house<lb/>
mosquito of the culex species is eradi-<lb/>
cated, no matter how well the city is<lb/>
cleaned and sewered, there will always be<lb/>
cases of yellow fever in the city.&rdquo;</p>
