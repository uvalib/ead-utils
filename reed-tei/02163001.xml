<p>NINTH REPORT ON THE YELLOW FEVER ON THE<lb/>
COAST OF THE MEXICAN GULF, BEING FROM THE<lb/>
22D TO THE 26TH OF OCTOBER, 1900.</p>
<p>BY DR. EDUARDO LICEAGA,<lb/>
PRESIDENT SUPERIOR BOARD OF HEALTH, MEXICO, MEX.</p>
<p>In fulfillment of the engagement which I have contracted with<lb/>
this Association, I now have the honor to present a summary of the<lb/>
cases of yellow fever which have been observed on the Gulf Coast<lb/>
of the Mexican Republic, and of the few which have appeared in the<lb/>
Port of Salina Cruz, the only one of the Pacific in which that disease<lb/>
has presented itself.</p>
<p>In order to take up the time of my hearers as little as possible, I<lb/>
have formed a diagram which represents the number of cases of this<lb/>
disease which have come to the knowledge of the Superior Board of<lb/>
Health, as well as of the deaths that have taken place.</p>
<p>In Veracruz, Orizaba and Cordoba, we have been able to get re-<lb/>
ports of almost all the cases, but in those small towns in which the<lb/>
fever is not endemic and where the sanitary service is not as yet well<lb/>
organized, precisely because the disease rarely appears, no reliable<lb/>
reports are made, either because the cases are not well authenticated,<lb/>
because there is a doubt as to whether the patients are suffering from<lb/>
yellow fever or from the bilious fever which is so prevalent in hot<lb/>
countries, or sometimes because, through the slight degree of culture<lb/>
on the part of the inhabitants, they ignore the advantages of isola-<lb/>
tion, and hide the facts so that the patients may not be taken to the<lb/>
lazarettes and separated from their families. For these reasons we<lb/>
have no complete knowledge of the cases of yellow fever.</p>
<p>The same thing does not happen with fatal cases, because in this<lb/>
country a body cannot be buried without the permission of the Regis-<lb/>
try Office, and the statistics of mortality are taken from that office.</p>
<p>In previous reports I have treated of the etiology of yellow fever,<lb/>
for which reason I do not consider it necessary to take up your time<lb/>
with that question; but I desire to inform the Association with re-<lb/>
gard to the measures that have been taken to prevent the spread of<lb/>
the disease along our coasts.</p>
<p>The States of the Mexican Union are independent in their legisla-<lb/>
tion and administration; but in the interest of public health, they have<lb/>
been induced to create a real Sanitary Federation.</p>
<p>34</p>
<pb n="2" id="f02163002"/>
<p><hi rend="italic">YELLOW FEVER ON COAST OF MEXICAN GULF</hi>.<lb/>
35</p>
<p>The States of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Chiapas and Tabasco<lb/>
have shown a very decided zeal in bringing their sanitary regulations<lb/>
in line with those of the Federation, and their political and municipal<lb/>
authorities have placed themselves in communication with the Su-<lb/>
perior Board of Health, so as to give uniformity to the sanitary<lb/>
measures which they may adopt.</p>
<p>Last year I announced in the meeting of this Association, that a<lb/>
disease had appeared in Orizaba, assuming an epidemic character.<lb/>
A certain number of physicians of that locality have been of the<lb/>
opinion that the epidemic was of paludic origin, malaria, but that it<lb/>
bore the characteristics of yellow fever. The greater part of the<lb/>
physicians of Orizaba and others of Veracruz, who have a perfect<lb/>
knowledge of the disease, declared it to be yellow fever. This is my<lb/>
own conviction, founded on the studies of pathological anatomy made<lb/>
by distinguished specialists of Mexico City on the clinical aspect of<lb/>
the disease, and on the fact that it was developed at the same time as<lb/>
the epidemic of yellow fever which was prevalent in the neighboring<lb/>
town of Cordoba, where the epidemic assumed a greater degree of<lb/>
intensity than in previous years in Veracruz, and at the same time<lb/>
spread, although on a smaller scale, to Merida, Progreso, Campeche,<lb/>
San Juan Bautista, Tuxpan, Tampico, etc. It would be rather an<lb/>
extraordinary thing for the disease which simultaneously appeared in<lb/>
those localities to be yellow fever, and the Orizaba epidemic to be<lb/>
only a paludic fever. If to this we add the opinions of the physicians<lb/>
above mentioned, who have had an extended experience of the dis-<lb/>
ease in places in which it is epidemic, you will understand how I<lb/>
come to be convinced that the epidemic in Orizaba was really yellow<lb/>
fever.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, and in order to exterminate the disease<lb/>
in Orizaba, the Government of the State of Veracruz and the Board<lb/>
of Health appointed a sanitary agent to overlook the carrying out of<lb/>
the measures, which resulted in an improved sanitation of that ward<lb/>
of the city which had been the scene of the devastation caused by the<lb/>
epidemic. A swamp was drained; the sheds and huts which had<lb/>
been the focus of the epidemic were destroyed; the dwellings of those<lb/>
who had suffered from the disease were disinfected; the rubbish was<lb/>
burned, the streets were swept and watered with greater frequency,<lb/>
and many other measures were taken, the result of which has been<lb/>
that during the present summer, and when the yellow fever has again<lb/>
appeared in Veracruz and other localities, not a single case has been<lb/>
observed in Orizaba.</p>
<p>The Port of Veracruz is already commencing its sanitary work;<lb/>
that of Tampico will very soon do the same thing, and the example<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02163003"/>
36<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">YELLOW FEVER ON COAST OF MEXICAN GULF</hi>.<lb/>
will be followed by other towns which have at times suffered from<lb/>
epidemics of this character.</p>
<p>The measures adopted by the towns in the States above mentioned<lb/>
have brought about a notable reduction in the number of cases of<lb/>
attack, as can be seen from the diagram I present with this report.<lb/>
The lines representing the mortality in Cordoba and Orizaba, refer<lb/>
to the past year and not to this; whilst even in Veracruz the epidemic<lb/>
of this year has not been as severe as that of the previous year. It is<lb/>
to be hoped that the sanitation of the towns, the isolation of the first<lb/>
cases of the disease, and the disinfection of the articles contaminated<lb/>
by the patients, will bring about the disappearance of the spontaneous<lb/>
cases that now present themselves in those places in which the epi-<lb/>
demic prevails, in like manner and with the same efficacy, as the<lb/>
Maritime Sanitary Regulations have prevented the importation of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
