<p>In accordance with the request of Mr. Wickliffe Rose,<lb/>
to which reference was made in memorandum of September 20,<lb/>
relative to investigations of malaria in cooperation with<lb/>
the International Health Commission, a conference was held<lb/>
at the Bureau today at which were present Mr. Wickliffe<lb/>
Rose, Assistant Surgeon Generals H. R. Carter and J. W.<lb/>
Kerr and Surgeon R. H. von Ezdorf.</p>
<p>After the reason for the conference was explained by<lb/>
Dr. Kerr, Mr. Rose outlined the ideas he had in mind in<lb/>
respect to demonstration work. He stated that while the<lb/>
matter had not been formally taken up with his Commission<lb/>
he was considering recommending two lines of experiments<lb/>
as outlined in the memorandum of September 30th. He made<lb/>
it clear that the first one of these experiments was to<lb/>
be carried out under the scientific supervision of Dr.<lb/>
C. C. Base with the administrative oversight of Dr. W.S.<lb/>
Leathers, and indicated that the second experiment could<lb/>
be carried on under the scientific supervision of officers<lb/>
of the Service, the actual field officers to be trained by<lb/>
the Service and placed for the time being under the orders<lb/>
of the Service officers and their salaries paid by the In-<lb/>
ternational Health Commission. It was understood also that<lb/>
this Commission would bear necessary expenses for personnel<lb/>
and quinine. He laid stress on the advantage to his Com-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00764075"/>
-2-<lb/>
mission in having men trained for antimalarial work which<lb/>
he purposed to take up abroad.</p>
<p>After discussion of the details of a typewritten out-<lb/>
line of the proposed demonstration which he submitted, it<lb/>
was concluded that it was desirable to enter into a co-<lb/>
operative arrangement. It was understood, of course,<lb/>
that this particular work would be carried on in addition<lb/>
to the regular Service work. Mr. Rose made it clear that<lb/>
the studies he had in mind would be confined to farm homes<lb/>
and not include village<del>s</del> homes or villages. He stated that<lb/>
the matter would be taken up with the Commission at its<lb/>
October meeting.</p>
