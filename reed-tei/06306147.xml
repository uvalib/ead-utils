<salute>My dear Friend:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I never did like the attitude that Carroll took after Lazear's death in<lb/>
trying to hog all the credit for the mosquitoe theory discovery. I always felt<lb/>
that he and Agramonti sort of understood each other. When he was out to Omaha<lb/>
to make the graduation address to the University Medical College. I had quite a<lb/>
talk with him on the matter and told him I thought he was taking the wrong<lb/>
attitude because after all Reed was the head of the board.</p>
<p>Regard the time and place that Dean was bitten by the mosquitoe, in my<lb/>
opinion it was in the ward as he was the only case in there and was suffering<lb/>
from inguinal adenitis and was kept in bed all the time, so I can hardly con-<lb/>
ceive that Lazear would take him to the laboratory when it was so easy to apply<lb/>
the mosquitoe while he was in bed.</p>
<p>The mosquitoe was applied to my arm on the porch of the officers' quarters<lb/>
by Lazear. There was present besides Lazear, Carroll and Ames. Stark was not<lb/>
there but when he heard what had been done, he almost took my head off and<lb/>
called my all names except pet ones.</p>
<p>I think you are right in regard to the huts occupied by the different men.<lb/>
Carroll was in 116 and Lazear 118. Lazear occupied the same hut after Colonel<lb/>
Kean's sickness and dismissal from the hospital. I am interested in the picture<lb/>
you sent of the detention camp but the names and circumstances under which it<lb/>
was taken are rather hazy. I remember where it was however.</p>
<p>Your letter of October 18 informing of acceptance by the Surgeon General<lb/>
to be issued by Carlyle as a medical bulletin. I think that is awfully com-<lb/>
plimentary to you and I want to join the rest of your good friends in my sin-<lb/>
cerest congratulations. Any statement that I have made, I assure you that I<lb/>
will be only to glad to have you quote from them. I have no doubt that there will<lb/>
be a good many who know little about the work and who think they know it all and<lb/>
will be ready to critize your statements, but you simply stand pat on what you<lb/>
have said and there is no getting around the facts of the case.</p>
<p>As regard the time Stark left on his vacation I am not able to say the exact<lb/>
date, however I do know it was the first week in Sept. 1900. Stark was not<lb/>
present at the time I was bitten which I remember was August 25, Later, he left<lb/>
on his vacation and <add><unclear>see</unclear></add> I was next in command of the hospital I sent Carroll to<lb/>
isolation when he became sick.</p>

<p>I had expected to see you in person before this time, however I have been<lb/>
delayed in making my trip and all I can say is that I hope it will be soon.</p>
<p>If there is anything further you want me to try to help you on, please feel<lb/>
perfectly free to ask me as I will be glad to add what little I know to your<lb/>
already wonderful manuscript.</p>
