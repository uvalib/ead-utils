<p>THE LAZEAR MEMORIAL</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>The quality of self-sacrifice is determined<lb/>
by the spirit in which it is performed,<lb/>
rather than by the extent to which its<lb/>
object is attained. But when conspicuous<lb/>
self sacrifice results in great service, de-<lb/>
liberately hoped for and enduring, it<lb/>
makes a double appeal to human interest.<lb/>
Such was the sacrifice made by Dr. Jesse<lb/>
William Lazear, the young army surgeon,<lb/>
who, with an equally devoted colleague,<lb/>
voluntarily exposed himself to infection<lb/>
by yellow fever in order that the knowl-<lb/>
edge gained from his case might help to<lb/>
establish those measures for preventing<lb/>
the spread of yellow fever, which have<lb/>
since been adopted with wonderful results.<lb/>
His colleague took the fever and recov-<lb/>
ered; Dr. Lazear took it and died.</p>
<p>Shortly after Dr. Lazear's death, which<lb/>
occurred Sept. 25, 1900, a committee of his<lb/>
colleagues and friends decided to raise<lb/>
money for a memorial of his great sacri-<lb/>
fice. It was Mrs. Lazear's wish that the<lb/>
memorial to her husband should take a<lb/>
permanent and useful form and that it<lb/>
should be associated in some way with the<lb/>
work of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. The<lb/>
precise form of the memorial is not yet de-<lb/>
termined, but the committee, which started<lb/>
with a small number of contributions and<lb/>
with modest hopes of what they could ac-<lb/>
complish, have been so encouraged by the<lb/>
interest which their plans have aroused<lb/>
that they now hope to establish a travelling<lb/>
scholarship. If the money raised should be<lb/>
insufficient to endow such a scholarship, it<lb/>
is proposed to establish a permanent<lb/>
library fund at the hospital which should<lb/>
be used especially for the purchase of<lb/>
books on tropical diseases. Whatever the<lb/>
decision may be, the money will be applied<lb/>
is accordance with Mrs. Lazear's wish and<lb/>
in the manner which seems, to the commit-<lb/>
tee, to serve best the cause to which Dr.<lb/>
Lazear gave his life.</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear's death inevitably gives in-<lb/>
terest to the principal facts about his life.<lb/>
He was born near Baltimore, in 1866; he<lb/>
graduated from the academic department<lb/>
of John Hopkins University in 1889, and<lb/>
from the College of Physicians and Sur-<lb/>
geons in New York in 1892; he spent two<lb/>
years as an interne in Bellevue Hospital,<lb/>
New York city, and one year in Europe;<lb/>
during a part of 1895 and 1896 he was as-<lb/>
sistant resident physician at the Johns<lb/>
Hopkins Hospital. He was married in 1896,<lb/>
and continued his connection with the hos-<lb/>
pital as instructor in clinical microscopy<lb/>
and as assistant in the dispensary; his<lb/>
principal work was in the clinical labora-<lb/>
tory, and he did valuable service as bac-<lb/>
teriologist to the medical staff. The re-<lb/>
sults of several of his investigations were<lb/>
published, and he wrote the section on<lb/>
diphtheria, plague, yellow fever and<lb/>
cerebro-spinal meningitis, in Progressive<lb/>
Medicine for March, 1899. (The credit for<lb/>
this section was by mistake given to an-<lb/>
other).</p>
<p>In the winter of 1900 he obtained an ap-<lb/>
pointment in the army as acting assistant<lb/>
surgeon with special laboratory duties, in<lb/>
order that he might study malaria and<lb/>
yellow fever in Cuba, and continue work<lb/>
which he had begun on the structure of<lb/>
the malarial parasite. Later he was ap-<lb/>
pointed with Drs. Reed and Carroll to<lb/>
serve on the Government commission for<lb/>
the study of yellow fever; and in this work<lb/>
his previous knowledge of mosquitoes<lb/>
proved of great value. The commission<lb/>
convinced themselves that a definite rela-<lb/>
tion existed between mosquitoes and the<lb/>
transmission of yellow fever. The three<lb/>
members of the commission, therefore,<lb/>
agreed to subject themselves to the bites<lb/>
of mosquitoes which had previously bitten<lb/>
yellow fever patients. Dr. Reed was called<lb/>
away to Washington, but Drs. Lazear and<lb/>
Carroll submitted to the experiment. Dr.<lb/>
Carroll developed yellow fever and recov-<lb/>
ered; Dr. Lazear at first escaped infection,<lb/>
apparently because the mosquito which<lb/>
had bitten him had not been kept a suffi-<lb/>
cient length of time; but subsequently,<lb/>
while working in a yellow fever ward, he<lb/>
allowed another mosquito to alight upon<lb/>
his arm, and, knowing that it would in all<lb/>
probability carry infection, he decided to<lb/>
try the experiment again. Three days later<lb/>
the symptoms of yellow fever appeared,<lb/>
and he died of the disease. The conclu-<lb/>
sions drawn from these two cases were<lb/>
borne out by subsequent investigations, and<lb/>
they have already brought about results<lb/>
of incalculable importance, both to Cuba<lb/>
and to the United States.</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear was a pure, upright and<lb/>
able man, and would undoubtedly have<lb/>
made a mark in his profession had he been<lb/>
spared for longer service. He left a wife<lb/>
and two little children.</p>
<p>Any persons who feel interested in the<lb/>
objects of this memorial and wish to have<lb/>
a part in perpetuating the influence of Dr.<lb/>
Lazear's self-sacrifice are requested to<lb/>
send contributions to Mr. Charles Francis<lb/>
Adams, 2d, 23 Court street, Boston, who<lb/>
has kindly consented to receive such con-<lb/>
tributions on behalf of the committee.</p>

<p>John Hogan Sent to State Prison</p>
<p>In the Superior Criminal Court, yester-<lb/>
day afternoon, Judge Lawton presiding,<lb/>
John Hogan, the South Boston real estate<lb/>
dealer who last week pleaded guilty to<lb/>
larceny in two counts, involving the misuse<lb/>
of $100 and $200 respectively, belonging to<lb/>
clients, was sentenced to serve from three<lb/>
to five years at hard labor in the State<lb/>
prison. Nearly all his victims were persons<lb/>
who could ill afford to lose what Hogan ob-<lb/>
tained from them by false representations.<lb/>
It was argued in Hogan's favor by his<lb/>
counsel that the cases, such as they were,<lb/>
were not criminal but civil in character.</p>
