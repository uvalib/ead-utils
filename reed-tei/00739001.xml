<salute>My Dear Daughter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>There was no steamer to N. O. this (last) week.<lb/>
So no extra letter was possible. I have had so busy a<lb/>
week that I could scarcely have written, at any rate written<lb/>
much, anyway, I am going to Guyaquil either<lb/>
Tuesday or Friday <unclear>on</unclear> business, &amp; if I can do so will <unclear><del>take</del></unclear><lb/>
go to Quito for pleasure while there, I suppose you<lb/>
know something about Quito; that it is on the equa-<lb/>
tor, but is cool, always - about our October cli-<lb/>
mate- It is the highest city in the world<lb/>
I mean in altitude, It is about 3 1/2 days to Guyaquil, I<lb/>
will have to stay there about 4 or 6 days. You will then<lb/>
miss your next week's letter &amp; possibly <hi>two</hi>, Do<lb/>
not be uneasy, because I will leave orders with<lb/>
Pierce or Perry to Cable if there be anything the<lb/>
matter &amp; I am going to see about the Quarantine work<lb/>
there, I surely wish you were here we would go together<lb/>
The sea trip you would not mind &amp; I know how you en-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00739002"/>
joy <del>out</del> going <del>to</del> out of the way places, The fare however<lb/>
is enormous- $80. to Guyaquil - &amp; while I can get a pass<lb/>
it is not easy to do, 1/2 fare is not so hard to obtain.<lb/>
If you were here now however we w'd<lb/>
see Quito together. <hi>Later</hi>- I may<lb/>
have to go to Callao - the part of Lima, but not<lb/>
for 4 to 6 months.</p>
<p><unclear>Mr</unclear> Barrett's reception was a success - I did not enclose<lb/>
the paper work to Ned, but if I can find it will do<lb/>
so-. He is a fairly pleasant man but an ass,-or at<lb/>
least a poseur &amp; extremely self conscious. I under-<lb/>
stand thoroughly his &ldquo;promotion&rdquo; from the Argentina to<lb/>
Panama. <unclear>Ancient</unclear> social affairs - of which I am on the<lb/>
outskirts just close enough to hear rumors - there<lb/>
is an organization here &ldquo;la Club Iris&rdquo;- the &ldquo;<hi>U</hi>&rdquo; is<lb/>
<hi>very</hi> long &amp; the &ldquo;i&rdquo;s are double &ldquo;e&rdquo;s - of young girls, etc.<lb/>
President of which is Elisa Espinosa, Miss E., with her<lb/>
sisters &amp; two cousins-&ldquo;the Leferre girls&rdquo; went to Notre Dame<lb/>
in Balt. &amp; are <hi>very</hi> American. They had a grand function<lb/>
a few days ago - &amp; there were two prices - a &ldquo;Gran Prix&rdquo; &amp; a<lb/>
little one - Prizes cancealed in small bags of candy &amp; dis-<lb/>
tributed by lot. <del>An</del><add>Two</add> girls, <hi>not</hi> <del>a</del> members of the club-<lb/>

attended, there are 40 members-, &amp; one<lb/>
of them got the &ldquo;Gran Prix.&rdquo; It was an ex-<lb/>
tremely outraged party of damsels &amp; &ldquo;the girl was<lb/>
so frightened <del>that</del> as the hostile demonstrations that<lb/>
she denied having the prize - a breast pin - although, she<lb/>
had shown &amp; boasted of it. The reason I write all<lb/>
this rigamarole is for Miss. E's speech in telling<lb/>
of it. &rdquo;Aftare all of the wurruk wee 'ave done for<lb/>
thee club here comes Miss Butt-in-sky<lb/>
an takes the Gran Prix! There is no question <add>that</add> Miss E. had been <add>in the U. S.</add></p>
<p>We have moved- &ldquo;from the large building-which is now being<lb/>
fitted up for quarters for Gorgas &amp; myself- to a <del>small to</del><lb/>
cottage- not so small- formerly <unclear>the</unclear> priest's house where&rdquo;<lb/>
Ross: Lyster (G's nephew) &amp; myself are domiciled. It is<lb/>
pleasanter than at the old place, because none of us<lb/>
quarrel &amp; are on good terms with one another - which<lb/>
is more than has been the case lately at the hospi-<lb/>
tal, We are still eating at the hospital mess, but will<lb/>
start a mess very shortly - but which will so far as I am<lb/>
concerned last but a <del>few</del><add>short</add> time I hope.</p>
<p>I enclose herewith <hi>20</hi>: &ldquo;medias&rdquo;- worth 2 1/2 cents each - a <hi>little</hi> less-<lb/>

which I think have decorative possibilities - What do<lb/>
you think. <del>A dollar can get <hi>42</hi><add>42</add> of them</del>: Can they be made<lb/>
into a bracelet or used as a trimming - <hi>42</hi> go to a dollar,<lb/>
There is a <hi>gold</hi> coin - about the same size - or half the size <del>ra</del><lb/>
rather - a &ldquo;Colon&rdquo; - of Costa Rica- which cost <hi>50</hi> cents <hi>each</hi>-<lb/>
How would they do in combination? Say a stout<lb/>
Silver band with medias strung at intervals for one<lb/>
bracelet &amp; a gold one in the Colones? <del>One</del> It is of brace-<lb/>
lets I am thinking- The effect might be somewhat<lb/>
barbaric, but would be pretty I think, One would not<lb/>
use the Colones as trimming.</p>
<p>We have just been talking-&amp; want to ask you what<lb/>
is the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> line of Julia Ward<del>s</del> Howe's &ldquo;Battle Hymn&rdquo;<lb/>
"I have listened to the trumpet which shall.... retreat,<lb/>
Here is the forgotten line<lb/>
&ldquo;My soul be swift to meet him be jubilant my feet.&rdquo;<lb/>
Also the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> line in the last verse.<lb/>
&ldquo;In the beauty. etc - - - - across the sea.&rdquo;<lb/>
2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> line<lb/>
&ldquo;As he died - - - - - - to make men free&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot answer your mothers question until I go to the<lb/>
office tomorrow, because I forgot the <hi>date</hi> she wishes to<lb/>
go to Norfolk, I will say that I have written to everyone</p>
<p>I can think of to get cheap rates via Havana; I expect to do what<lb/>
I can to come that route. If I cannot I will come anyway &amp;<lb/>
we will discuss. it &amp; unless we think<lb/>
the P. W. <hi>cannot</hi> take the journey we<lb/>
will come same way. If she cannot<lb/>
I will. &ldquo;chuck the job&rdquo; as soon as I can<lb/>
without losing the effect of my work &amp; come<lb/>
home to stay home. <del>"</del></p>
