Major General Paul H. Streit<lb/>
Walter Reed Army Medical Center<lb/>
Washington 12, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Streit:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am sorry that I have not been able sooner to send you the enclosed<lb/>
report on the dedication of Camp Lazear. Your presence was greatly<lb/>
missed. Please see the enclosed copy of a letter I have just sent to<lb/>
General Armstrong.</p>
<p>I ran out of newspaper clippings and since you were delegated to represent<lb/>
General Armstrong and since your name is mentioned frequently in these<lb/>
papers, I am sending you a more complete collection than that to General<lb/>
Armstrong. If you think that he would care to see the ones which you only<lb/>
are receiving, please let him see them or give them to him. The ones he<lb/>
does have I have marked duplicate (&ldquo;dup&rdquo;) on your copy.</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern about the money. I would appreciate having<lb/>
it whenever it is convenient and as per our later discussions two wreaths<lb/>
were laid by substitutes for you in behalf of the Surgeon General (see my<lb/>
letter to General Armstrong). The wreaths cost $15 each. They were really<lb/>
very lovely so that if you can have approved for me a check for $30 I should<lb/>
be glad to receive it at your convenience. The florist only gave me one bill<lb/>
listing all the organizations presenting them. If you need a copy I can<lb/>
have an <unclear>ozalid</unclear> copy made of mine. The company name of the florist was<lb/>
&ldquo;Milagros Flores&rdquo;, Lucila Schumann, President.</p>
<p>It was indeed a shame that you were not there. You would have had a grand<lb/>
time, would have met a great many very interesting and fine people and I<lb/>
think you would have enjoyed the diplomatic and social functions that were<lb/>
held in connection with the dedication.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
