<p>YELLOW FEVER AND QUARANTINE.</p>
<p>Official conservatism is very clearly<lb/>
illustrated in the fact that the important<lb/>
and apparently conclusive experiments<lb/>
made in Cuba under the direction of<lb/>
Surgeon REED, United States Army, re-<lb/>
garding the conveyance and propagation<lb/>
of yellow fever have thus far made little<lb/>
or no impression upon the conventional<lb/>
methods of quarantine. When it is re-<lb/>
membered that any interruption of com -<lb/>
merce imposes burdens upon merchants<lb/>
and carriers which ultimately fall upon<lb/>
the consumer, and are compensated in<lb/>
increased prices and higher freight rates,<lb/>
it becomes very clear that if the deten-<lb/>
tion of ships from infected ports is as<lb/>
unnecessary as the Cuban experiments<lb/>
would warrant us in believing, the prac-<lb/>
tice should be discontinued at every port<lb/>
where quarantine has any other pur-<lb/>
pose than to accumulate charges im-<lb/>
posed and collected for the advantage of<lb/>
the officials who assess and collect them,<lb/>
as the robber barons once levied tolls<lb/>
and duties on the commerce of the Rhine.</p>
<p>While it is doubtless true that the<lb/>
Cuban tests have left some points in-<lb/>
volved in doubt, the one question which<lb/>
they appear to have settled beyond dis-<lb/>
pute is that under no conditions which<lb/>
admit of artificial production is it possi-<lb/>
ble to infect the non-immune from con-<lb/>
tact with the fomites of yellow fever in<lb/>
clothing, bedding, and personal effects.<lb/>
Even rags for paper stock could not very<lb/>
well be as dangerous as the fabrics from<lb/>
the beds of patients who had died from<lb/>
yellow fever in Las Animas Hospital,<lb/>
in which non-immunes slept for weeks<lb/>
under the conditions of high tempera-<lb/>
ture, artificial dampness, and so little<lb/>
ventilation as to threaten asphyxiation.<lb/>
Disinfection becomes as ineffective as an<lb/>
incantation when there is nothing in<lb/>
the way of infectious germs to destroy.<lb/>
In the case of a house in which yellow<lb/>
fever has occurred the question with the<lb/>
United States Army experts in Cuba is<lb/>
simply how to destroy the mosquitos<lb/>
which may have bitten the patients.<lb/>
Sulphur fumes and formaldehyde are the<lb/>
favorite agencies for the destruction of<lb/>
the culex; but, their destruction accom-<lb/>
plished, further disinfection would seem<lb/>
to be a waste of time and material.<lb/>
Either will kill all the mosquitos in from<lb/>
ten to different minutes, and as they are<lb/>
as dead at the end of that time as they<lb/>
ever will be, this period would seem to<lb/>
fix the limit of useful quarantine deten-<lb/>
tion. In his report on sanitation and<lb/>
yellow fever in Havana. Surgeon HAV-<lb/>
ARD, United States Army, after describ-<lb/>
ing the very simple process of house dis-<lb/>
infection now practiced, says: &ldquo;The<lb/>
duties of quarantine officers have also<lb/>
become singularly simplified. Since we<lb/>
may assume in practice that the infec-<lb/>
tious germs do not exist outside of man<lb/>
or mosquito, the disinfection of trunks<lb/>
and baggage on account of yellow fever<lb/>
is no longer justifiable. All that is re-<lb/>
quired will be the examination of the<lb/>
non-immunes within the five days imme-<lb/>
diately following their last exposure to<lb/>
infection, the danger of transmission be-<lb/>
ing from their own persons, and in no-<lb/>
wise from their clothing or baggage.<lb/>
Ships, like houses, are liable to harbor<lb/>
infected mosquitos, and will continue to<lb/>
require fumigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not a sufficient answer to the<lb/>
concurrent judgement of our army Sur-<lb/>
geons to brush their conclusions aside as<lb/>
&ldquo;not proven.&rdquo; The results they have<lb/>
attained have carried their work far<lb/>
beyond the theoretical stage, and better<lb/>
proof than they have given of the abso-<lb/>
lute correctness of their observations<lb/>
could not be furnished outside of a math-<lb/>
ematical demonstration. The Province<lb/>
of Santiago is now as free from yellow<lb/>
fever as New York. This result in what<lb/>
for more than four centuries has been<lb/>
the home of yellow fever and a centre<lb/>
of infection is as good proof as even the<lb/>
most conservative practitioner of medical<lb/>
traditions should need to satisfy him<lb/>
that new truths have been added to the<lb/>
sum of human knowledge of the etiology<lb/>
of this dread disease. The results in<lb/>
Havana are not yet quite as complete<lb/>
as they are in Santiago, but are suffi-<lb/>
ciently remarkable to leave no room for<lb/>
doubt that the progress has been along<lb/>
lines which will lead to the complete<lb/>
extinction of the disease.</p>
<p>Of the work in Havana, the report on<lb/>
this subject lately published by the War<lb/>
Department, through the Division of In-<lb/>
sular Affairs, says:</p>
<p>There have been years in which there<lb/>
was very little yellow fever, but none in<lb/>
which it has entirely disappeared as at<lb/>
present. It would therefore seem to be a<lb/>
fair inference that the improved method of<lb/>
disinfection killed off the infected mosqui-<lb/>
tos; that by March 8 the city had been rid<lb/>
of the infection, and was free of fever un-<lb/>
til April 20, when a focus of infection<lb/>
again developed. Disinfection again ap-<lb/>
parently killed the infected mosquitos, as<lb/>
the city was free from fever until May 6,<lb/>
when another focus developed. The same<lb/>
method of disinfection was again applied,<lb/>
with the result that no cases developed<lb/>
after that date. It is believed that, pursu-<lb/>
ing the present methods, the island can be<lb/>
rid of yellow fever, and its spread may be<lb/>
prevented even when introduced from the<lb/>
outside. If this condition can be brought<lb/>
about many of the restrictions now imposed<lb/>
upon commerce by quarantines can be done<lb/>
away with.</p>
<p>It is encouraging that, in accordance<lb/>
with the suggestion made at and ap-<lb/>
proved by the third Pan_American Med-<lb/>
ical Congress in Havana, a conference<lb/>
has been called of delegates represent-<lb/>
ing the several American republics, to<lb/>
consider and, if possible, agree upon a<lb/>
uniform system of quarantine in accord-<lb/>
ance with what the work of the past two<lb/>
years has demonstrated in Cuba. It<lb/>
should be remembered, however, that<lb/>
traditions die hard and that ancient<lb/>
superstitions have surprising vitality.</p>
