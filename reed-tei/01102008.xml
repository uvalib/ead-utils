<salute>Dear Doctor Stimson:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am enclosing a reprint of Father's, which I had in mind last<lb/>
night when you were telling me of Colonel James' statements.</p>
<p>Father says that there have been one or two articles by Angus<lb/>
MacDonald since the war accompanied with temperature records of the<lb/>
districts in England: That MacDonald takes the same view that he<lb/>
did--that with a temperature below 61&deg; the parasites do not develope<lb/>
in the mosquitoes and that the infection will naturally die out in<lb/>
any reasonably cold summer--certainly if a succession of them occurs.</p>
<p>That--Colonel James to the contrary--control of mosquito product-<lb/>
ion was used and depended on during and soon after the war in the<lb/>
worst infected districts south of the Thames. For so much of the work<lb/>
as James was in charge of, quinine sterilization of reported cases<lb/>
and, to some extent, of carriers were the measures relied on. In<lb/>
Father's judjment while this hastened the elimination of malaria<lb/>
it was really unnecessary and the work yielded he supposes from 10 to<lb/>
15 shillings value per &pound;/of expenditure. This was also the opinion<lb/>
of Ross and Osler. James is no field man. All his reputation--which<lb/>
is well deserved--is as a bench man.</p>
<p>He, Father, asks you to note the absolute absence of malignant<lb/>
tertian--although nearly 30% of the introduced infections were of<lb/>
that character. The developement of this parasite requires a some-<lb/>
what higher temperature than the benign tertian.</p>
<p>He says that MacDonald also agrees with him in his claim that a<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01102009"/>
a<lb/>
2<lb/>
considerable number of the early cases of malarial fever are infect-<lb/>
ions caused by the hibernated females and not, as they had hitherto<lb/>
been considered, by relapses from last year's infections and that<lb/>
he was glad to have the support of so good a man.</p>
<p>With very best remembrances from us both to Mrs. Stimson and<lb/>
yourself.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Cordially yours,</salute>
Enclosure.<lb/>
