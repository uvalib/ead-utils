<p>The work of the Medical<lb/>
Congress has demonstrated to<lb/>
the satisfaction of everyone that<lb/>
the doctrine of survival of the<lb/>
fittest germ will be the therapeu-<lb/>
tics of the future.</p>
<p>The most notable document<lb/>
read during the conve<unclear>n</unclear>tion was<lb/>
the report of Surgeon Major<lb/>
Reed, in which he gave results<lb/>
obtained from the studies and<lb/>
experiments made at Camp<lb/>
Columbia by the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Board. He and his colleagues<lb/>
have proven <unclear>co clusively</unclear> that<lb/>
the mosquito as a conveyor of<lb/>
infection is responsible for yellow<lb/>
as well as malarial fever.<lb/>
Enlarging upon the discoveries<lb/>
of Doctor Finlay, the physicians<lb/>
at Quemados have learned much<lb/>
that will be of immense assistance<lb/>
in future attempts to prevent<lb/>
spread of the disease that has<lb/>
made Havana a place to be<lb/>
dreaded and avoided.</p>
<p>Too much credit cannot be<lb/>
given Dr Finlay and the other<lb/>
gentlemen who composed the<lb/>
Board. The former, entirely<lb/>
unaided, had done much of the<lb/>
preliminary examination, inves-<lb/>
tigation and development; basing<lb/>
his work on the belief that--<lb/>
experiments in the Ro an Cam-<lb/>
pagna having demonstrated<lb/>
culpability of <hi rend="italic">culex anopheles</hi> in<lb/>
propagation of malaria--the germ<lb/>
of yellow fever could be conveyed<lb/>
in similar manner, he set about<lb/>
confirming his theory. So suc-<lb/>
cessful was he that he not only<lb/>
was able to prove his correctness<lb/>
of idea but he discovered the<lb/>
variety which alone carries the<lb/>
germ, and has thoroughly learned<lb/>
its nature, manner of propagation,<lb/>
habits during life, etc.</p>
<p>The other members of the<lb/>
Board have worked steadily and<lb/>
courageously, in spite of the<lb/>
danger to which submitted. Three<lb/>
of them were attacked by yellow<lb/>
fever, one dying, Doctor Lazear,<lb/>
a veritable martyr to his prof-<lb/>
ession and the particular cause<lb/>
in which he had enlisted. His<lb/>
death was a melancholy subs-<lb/>
tantiation of the idea, he being<lb/>
inoculated by the poison from<lb/>
one of his own mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The study has not nearly ap-<lb/>
proached its conclusion. The<lb/>
physicians engaged in it are<lb/>
agreed that the mosquito is guilty,<lb/>
but they all believe that fever is<lb/>
conveyed in some other manner,<lb/>
as yet undiscovered; whether<lb/>
infections, contagious, s<unclear>p</unclear>oradic<lb/>
or infusoric will be decided in<lb/>
future.</p>
<p>At any rate, enough is known<lb/>
to warrant search for an anti-<lb/>
toxin, as future treatment of the<lb/>
disease will unquestionably be<lb/>
by inoculation, as is already the<lb/>
case with small-pox and <unclear>diph-</unclear><lb/>
theria.</p>
<p>Therein lies danger, of course.<lb/>
When Jenna, in Ireland, disco-<lb/>
vered that varioloid pustules were<lb/>
found on the bands of the majo-<lb/>
rity of milkers of cows, he sought<lb/>
and found the cause on the teats<lb/>
of the animals themselves. Dis-<lb/>
covery of the virus led to whole-<lb/>
sale inoculation of the populace<lb/>
--and wholesale death. Since<lb/>
then, science has so subjugated<lb/>
the virus that vaccination is<lb/>
simple, the after effect slight, and<lb/>
immunity guaranteed.</p>
<p>Similary successful have been<lb/>
experiments with diphtheretic<lb/>
anti-toxin.</p>
<p>In experimenting for a like cure<lb/>
or preventative of yellow fever,<lb/>
Lefevre, Sanarelly and Bellinzangi<lb/>
have been more or less success-<lb/>
ful.</p>
<p>Lefevre, in Rio Janeiro, dis-<lb/>
covered a virus that was ap-<lb/>
parently efficacious; he reduced<lb/>
mortality among his patients<lb/>
from seventy-nine to eight per<lb/>
cent, but he lost many cases<lb/>
solely from inoculation.</p>
<p>The serum prepared by Sana-<lb/>
relli was a failure, and has been<lb/>
practically abandoned.</p>
<p>Doctor <unclear>Bellinzangi</unclear> is now in<lb/>
Mexico. The Mexican Board of<lb/>
Health allowed him, six months<lb/>
ago, to try his serum on a case<lb/>
considered hopeless; the patient<lb/>
had become infected in Vera<lb/>
Cruz, and had, while ill, gone<lb/>
to the higher altitude of the<lb/>
City of Mexico, a course in-<lb/>
variably fatal; congestion had<lb/>
taken place throughout the mu-<lb/>
cous system, the kidneys were<lb/>
practically paralyzed, black vomit<lb/>
had set in, and it was believed<lb/>
impossible to save the life. Bel-<lb/>
linzaghi, not daunted by the<lb/>
severity of the test, essayed a<lb/>
cure and was wonderfully suc-<lb/>
cessful; within four days the<lb/>
case was pronounced out of<lb/>
danger. The young Italian then<lb/>
received permission to continue<lb/>
use of his serum, and saved<lb/>
eight-five per cent of his patients,<lb/>
being given, always, the worst<lb/>
cases obtainable, in many in-<lb/>
stances only being summoned<lb/>
when other physicians were<lb/>
hopeless.</p>
<p>His serum was so satisfactory<lb/>
that he was paid the sum of<lb/>
$100,000 that had been offered<lb/>
by the Mexican Government for<lb/>
a cure for yellow fever.</p>
<p>The physicians making a study<lb/>
of the subject have pretty gen-<lb/>
erally agreed upon two points;<lb/>
propagation by means of mos-<lb/>
quito inoculation, and cure--<lb/>
ultimately prevention--by serum<lb/>
inoculation, whether that of Bel-<lb/>
linzahgi or some future discoverer<lb/>
remains to be seen.</p>
<p>What has been accomplished<lb/>
is immensely interesting, and<lb/>
will prove tremendously benefi-<lb/>
cial. Not only in treatment of<lb/>
yellow, but also with other<lb/>
fevers. There have been many<lb/>
experiments in search of causes<lb/>
of disease, and the theory of<lb/>
conveyance by insect has been<lb/>
gradually gaining strength. Doc-<lb/>
tor Griffith, of Kansas City, de-<lb/>
clared to the Congress that, in<lb/>
his estimation, the fly is to ty-<lb/>
phoid what the mosquito is to<lb/>
yellow fever, an idea that he<lb/>
absorbed in 1898, since borne<lb/>
out by his own experiments and<lb/>
those of others.</p>
<p>Whatever may develop in<lb/>
future, humanity in general and<lb/>
Havana in particular owe all<lb/>
honor and gratitude to the men<lb/>
who have risked their lives and<lb/>
devoted their energies to a sub-<lb/>
ject so vitally important. Whether<lb/>
or no they finally discover and<lb/>
establish positive preventative<lb/>
and cure, to them belongs the<lb/>
honor of having given to re-<lb/>
search the trend that unquest-<lb/>
ionably will eventually bring<lb/>
about the desired result.</p>
