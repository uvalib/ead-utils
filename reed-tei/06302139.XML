<salute>My dear Mrs. Kissinger:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just returned from my Eastern trip, having gone to my<lb/>
college's twenty-fifth reunion. While in Easton, my family sent a wire<lb/>
telling me of Mr. Kissinger's serious illness. This has distressed me<lb/>
greatly.</p>
<p>He told me that he had had some sort of an illness which made<lb/>
me wonder whether he hadn't had a little stroke, but I didn't tell him<lb/>
that. Nevertheless, he seemed so cheerful and happy, and made a short<lb/>
but very nice little response when called upon to rise and receive the<lb/>
acknowledgement of the audience. It was a small but a most appreciative<lb/>
and distinguished audience. The President and President-elect of the<lb/>
American Medical Association were there and deans of certain medical<lb/>
schools, other well-known physicians and a number of directors of art<lb/>
institutes. Mr. Kissinger captured the admiration of the audience and<lb/>
many of them came forward to meet him and get his autograph as a souvenir<lb/>
of a very pleasant occasion.</p>
<p>I most sincerely hope that you can write me that he is improving,<lb/>
even though slowly. I know you must be greatly troubled but undoubtedly<lb/>
his friendly physicians in Huntington are doing everything they possibly<lb/>
can for him. If I thought there was anything in the world that I could do<lb/>
I should be only too glad to do it but those things which can be done for<lb/>
a person who has had a stroke are very limited indeed and undoubtedly they<lb/>
are being done. Despite your anxiety I shall be so grateful if you would<lb/>
keep me informed as to his progress.</p>
<p>Our hearts are with you and our prayers and thoughts are in his<lb/>
behalf.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
