<salute>Dear Jack:</salute>
</opener>
<p>As an addendum to my letter of last Friday, written <hi>very</hi> hurriedly<lb/>
in order to catch the last collection of mail that night:</p>
<p>While I am, as I wrote you, most deeply touched at your heading<lb/>
the second part of your Preface: &ldquo;Note by the Editors,&rdquo; I feel now, as I<lb/>
felt then, that the final &ldquo;s,&rdquo; (for the thought of which I am so grateful!)<lb/>)
should be deleted. Indeed, I had started my last letter to you with a<lb/>
statement to that effect, when Grace Brown came in and asked me to wait<lb/>
and think it over. Being already dissatisfied with the inadequate begin-<lb/>
ing of my letter (I was, as I said, writing against time and on the type-<lb/>
writer) I simply jerked out the sheet and started over again, merely ex-<lb/>
pressing my profound gratitude and appreciation for your generous thought, and<lb/>
postponing this part of the letter until later.</p>
<p>As I have told you, the fact that the book will be published &ldquo;as<lb/>
Father wished it to be,&rdquo; is due to yourself alone. Also, in order that the<lb/>
medical profession as a whole may know that this posthumous book will be<lb/>
so published, it does seem to me that you should sign your name to the<lb/>
editorial Note. This, if you still do not think it proper to do as I,<lb/>
suggested and allow your name to appear with Father's on the title page.</p>
<p>Have not yet heard from Mr. Martel, as to the amended form of<lb/>
acknowledgement to Grace Brown <add><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></add>. Grace herself, however, to whom I showed<lb/>
your Preface on her birthday, suggests that you amend it to read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bibliography has been prepared with the assistance of Miss<lb/>
Grace Brown, of the Catalogue Division of the Library of Congress&rdquo; etc. This,<lb/>
if we get nothing better from Martel. Putting in the words &ldquo;of the Catalogue<lb/>
Division&rdquo; helps to vouch for her special equipment for such work. <del>and</del><lb/>
<del><unclear>also places her, as there are several Miss Browns in the Library.</unclear></del> Also it<lb/>
is &ldquo;a feather in the cap&rdquo; of the Division. You, however, know what is pro-<lb/>
per under the circumstances far better than I.</p>
<p>I am sending you, under separate cover, a few of the library cards<lb/>
that you wanted looked up. There is explanatory matter on them, which seems<lb/>
better than putting it in here.</p>
<p>Both of the periodical refs. to Audouard seem unsatisfactory, al-<lb/>
though I shall make further search to-morrow, when the Army Medical Library<lb/>
is again open.</p>
<p>The enclosed transcription from Guyon, (Christian name not <unclear>given</unclear>,<lb/>
in Gaz. med. de Paris) makes one <del>very</del> sceptical about <unclear>Abreu</unclear> as a ref. for<lb/>
yellow fever as occurring in Madeira in 1738. I do wish that we could get<lb/>
hold of Abreu's book and also that of Busto y Blanco!</p>
<p>Sorry that this is also written in a hurry, as we have only one<lb/>
collection of mail on Labor Day. Love to the Susans. Salvus sit!</p>

<salute>Hastily and most gratefully,</salute>
