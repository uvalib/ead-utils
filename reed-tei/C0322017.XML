<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Just to report another week of intensive work, on the part of<lb/>
Miss Brown and myself, and of <add>very</add> satisfactory progress. Indeed, I cannot<lb/>
speak too highly of Miss Brown's devotion, enthusiasm and efficiency.<lb/>
My one regret, for the past seven days, is that Dr. Frost had to post-<lb/>
pone his trip to Washington. He hopes, however, to be over sometime<lb/>
this coming week. The delay in Dr. Frost's arrival does not interfere<lb/>
with the present progress of the bibliographic work. I shall, however,<lb/>
be very glad to see Dr. Frost when he comes and shall, of course, prompt-<lb/>
ly write you of what he says both as to what has been done since I left<lb/>
the Hopkins and as to what remains to be done.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile with very best wishes, and assuring you that the<lb/>
work is being pressed to the utmost</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
<signed>Laura A. Carter</signed>
Dr. Frederick F. Russell, Director,<lb/>
International Health Division,<lb/>
The Rockefeller Foundation,<lb/>
61 Broadway, New York, N. Y.<lb/>
As I wrote you, when I first started work at the Library of Congress,<lb/>
Dr. Putnam and his staff have been most kind in affording me facilities<lb/>
for my work. I mention this again as they are constantly surprising me<lb/>
with new evidences of their thoughtfulness and helpful consideration of <lb/>
my needs in pushing through so complicated a thing<del>s</del> as the bibliography<lb/>
of the History of Yellow Fever.<lb/>
Speaking of yellow fever, have you heard the details of Noguchi's<lb/>
death yet? I have heard so many contradictory statements that I should be<lb/>
grateful to know just how it happened: as I shall ever deplore its occurrence!<lb/>
L.A.C.<lb/>

P. S. Is it true, as I have been told, that Theodore Hayne, son of<lb/>
the Health Officer of South Carolina is with your Division? If so,<lb/>
I congratulate both sides! Father said that Theodore was the best man<lb/>
of his age whom he had ever seen: fine mind and character: enthusiastic<lb/>
about his work and with great energy and executive ability in addition to<lb/>
his intellect.<lb/>
