<salute>Dear Dr Grote:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I suspect that you have wondered why I have not<lb/>
answered your letter of Nov 19.! I was in Porto Rico at the<lb/>
time - and <unclear>on</unclear> that sick in hospital with Dengue, I have just<lb/>
returned &amp; will at least acknowledge it at once, although I<lb/>
am not, it may be, prepared to answer it.</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>In my judgement, so far as I have data &amp; time to form one there<lb/>
<add>there</add> is only one method <del><unclear>open open to us</unclear></del> to control <add>your</add> Malaria in<lb/>
<unclear></unclear> - <del>regard to the Malaria</del><lb/>
Walker Co. that is at all feasible, viz. <add>work</add> from the end of<lb/>
the human host, with protection of the man against<lb/>
the <add>access of the</add> mosquito as an adjuvant, I do not think meas-<lb/>
ures for the control of mosquito production are feasible.<lb/>
Although I do not believe that there will ever be as<lb/>
many again as there were last September</p>
<p>The work advised requires (A) sterilization of human<lb/>
Carriers.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00764096"/>
C1<lb/>
B20<lb/>
2<lb/>
Carriers, <del>by Q</del> which implies (I) determination of Carriers<lb/>
(a) by blood examination or (b<del>y</del>) by history: assuming that all who<lb/>
had mal. fever last fall were carriers- Naturally <hi>(a)</hi> is far<lb/>
the best method. (II) systematic exhibition of quinine to<lb/>
such carriers until free from Parasites</p>
<p>If this be done <hi>completely</hi> the mosquitoes next summer<lb/>
will have no source of infection - but it is <add>a</add> difficult thing<lb/>
to get <hi>completely done</hi>. It is possible however &amp; has been done</p>
<p>(B) The <hi>Cure</hi> of every person <del>quo</del> who by any chance<lb/>
develops malarial fever next summer or fall, I say<lb/>
<hi>Cure</hi>, meaning freeing from infection not simply<lb/>
relieving present symptoms. This also is hard to have<lb/>
done, <add><del>from</del></add> both physicians &amp; patients, oppose one.</p>
<p>(C) In addition I would advise the use of Qui-<lb/>
nine as a prophylactic - for all who live in the<lb/>
malarial district. Koch's method 15 grams, per day<lb/>
<del>for</del> on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> days from the last dose - (ie 2 doses every 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
day) is probably preferable with the present price<lb/>
of<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00764097"/>
3<lb/>
of quinine - 6 gr. per day is probably better to me but<lb/>
not much.</p>
<p>Theoretically if (A) &amp; (B) are <hi>perfectly</hi> carried out (C) is<lb/>
unnecessary, but it is extremely difficult to carry out<lb/>
measures of this kind perfectly &amp; I would strongly advise<lb/>
the use of prophylactic quinine from <hi>about</hi> <del>July 1</del><add>June 17</add> to<lb/>
say - Oct 1. This would for Koch's method be 25 doses of<lb/>
15 grains each, for an adult- During July indeed the<lb/>
interval might be made 10 instead of 8 days - making one less<lb/>
dose.</p>
<p>The adjuvant, protection of man against the access of<lb/>
mosquitoes, is <hi>screening</hi> &amp; <hi>mosquito bars</hi>. People have<lb/>
to be instructed in the use of both: <hi>shown</hi> not told, lots<lb/>
of us are from Missouri, &amp; shown many times. In some<lb/>
houses this can be made a valuable adjuvant<lb/>
<del>in</del><add>but</add> many <del>the</del> houses: are so open that screening can<lb/>
not be used efficiently: mosquito bars can always be<lb/>
used &amp; do some good.</p>
<p>Now I want to tell you that the Rockefeller people have<lb/>
under consideration a project of taking<lb/>

<del>he</del><lb/>
two places in the South &amp; trying out the very plan<lb/>
I have <add>here</add> outlined. This work is to be done in conjunction<lb/>
with this service. I <del>do not know if</del> think that they do not want<lb/>
this talked of yet &amp; will ask that you consider this confiden-<lb/>
tial for the present. The Foundation would furnish<lb/>
the Quinine: part of the expenses of the personnel.<lb/>
They would furnish a carpenter to fit screens, etc. but<lb/>
will not furnish material for screening, or mosquito<lb/>
bars.</p>
<p>I missed my chance of being present at the last meet-<lb/>
ing by being sick in San Juan &amp; do not know, whether<lb/>
they have definitely decided to go into this thing or<lb/>
not. Nor do I know if <add>they would consider that</add> Walker County would be a suit-<lb/>
able place for a demonstration. They would prefer a<lb/>
place where malaria had long been <del>a</del> steady. I<lb/>
mean where there were no great fluctuations in<lb/>
number of cases. <del>This has</del> This is not the case with<lb/>

Walker Co.. The best that I can do then is to send<lb/>
your letter to van Ezdorf &amp; to Kerr (in W<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>) &amp; see what they<lb/>
think of it. It is <hi>not</hi> the class of place Dr. Rose contemplated.</p>
<p>This work would be done under the H.O. &amp; he would have<lb/>
to guarantee (as far as one can guarantee the action of<lb/>
another man) the co&ouml;peration of the community &amp;,<lb/>
it would be &ldquo;up to him&rdquo; to get that co&ouml;peration <add>from</add> physi-<lb/>
cians &amp; laymen. Can you do this? No man, by allowable<lb/>
means, could get the co&ouml;peration of the people in Jefferson<lb/>
County <unclear>on</unclear> the Warrior.</p>
<p>If you think <del>you can get</del><add>so</add> write to van Ezdorf at <unclear>N. O.</unclear>. To him<lb/>
you can quote anything I have said, for I would be glad to<lb/>
see this work done in Walker Co. (<hi>A</hi>) should be done be-<lb/>
fore hot weather- Feb &amp; March or April, would be a good<lb/>
time - but up to-May- May 15 <add>or even 15 days later</add> isn't too late. <del>I</del></p>
<p>If we can't help you, I hope we can, go to work yourself<lb/>
on the lines indicated. <hi>If you can't do all indi-<lb/>
cated</hi>- <hi>confine yourself</hi> to <hi>prophylactic quinine (C)</hi><lb/>
This ought to <hi>control</hi> malaria. Quinine ought<lb/>
to be furnished at wholesale rates by the county<lb/>

or state.- It would be about 1 1/2.oz per - year - per - <hi>Adult</hi><lb/>
plus. some to keep under the malaria already <del>ex-<lb/>
isting</del>.<add>contracted</add>.</p>
<p>I did not mean to <hi>advise</hi> you to &ldquo;confine yourself to pro-<lb/>
phylactic Quinine&rdquo;, The whole program is advisable.<lb/>
What I meant was that even if you could not carry<lb/>
out (A) &amp; (B), that prophylactic Quinine <add>(C)</add> would give<lb/>
you a pretty fair control.</p>
<p>Also preach mosquito bars &amp; screening where<lb/>
practicable show them how to use them-</p>
