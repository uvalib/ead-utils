and to note you are all progressing<lb/>
nicely. I trust by the time this reaches<lb/>
you that Lottie has fully recovered and<lb/>
again finding her in her usual<lb/>
normal condition which I think can<lb/>
be brought about by reason of<lb/>
her great M. D. Husband.</p>

including my self. I should answered<lb/>
your letter sooner but I was waiting<lb/>
to get hold of the Men I wanted<lb/>

from my District and Succeeded in<lb/>
getting some of them which they promi-<lb/>
sed Me. to write Congressman Knutson<lb/>

#2<lb/>
the matter up with our State<lb/>
legislative Board which they complied<lb/>
with my request and wrote him a copy<lb/>
of their instrument I am enclosing<lb/>
to you. I was very anxious to <add>do</add> something<lb/>
for Mrs Reed, by reason of <hi>Your Appeal</hi><lb/>
to Me. I took the Matter up with Dr<lb/>
Voyer but dont know what he done<lb/>
about it. as I dont See him very often<lb/>
I trust that She may get the increase<lb/>
in her pension at least <unclear>Some</unclear> more<lb/>
than She is Now recieving.</p>
<p>We had a nice visit from Jim Griffin<lb/>
lost fall and enjoyed him very much he<lb/>
was here during the Genl Election in<lb/>
Nov. at My House getting the Election<lb/>
returns over the Radio Election night.<lb/>
I thought Jim would pass away as the returns<lb/>
were coming in adverse to Al Smith in<lb/>
the State of New York. Now getting back to<lb/>
the question of you coming out here to pay<lb/>
us a visit which you have attention to the<lb/>
fact. That you do not want to defer this<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03175007"/>

time to write me occasionally. So I<lb/>
may know who you are. So I will<lb/>
close for this time. Kindly remember<lb/>
me to all the Tansey Family. And with<lb/>
kindest regards and best wishes from<lb/>
