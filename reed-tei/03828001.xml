<salute>Dear old George Kellogg-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter with two newspaper pictures of the &ldquo;Conquerors<lb/>
of Yellow Fever&rdquo; dated July 25 I had the pleasure of reading<lb/>
yesterday, Oct. 17) What do you know! It seems that that<lb/>
letter of yours arrived the day I was bodily picked up from<lb/>
my bed at Blue Ridge and brought to the Walter Reed Hospital<lb/>
where I stayed until Oct 9th. I certainly threw one &ldquo;big fit&rdquo;<lb/>
a complete nervous collapse. Well, I dn't remember much<lb/>
about it. Am feeling quite well now for one of my tender<lb/>
years and my life has been taken over by my family, General<lb/>
and Mrs. Reed, many doctors. I am not allowed to go back to<lb/>
Blue Ridge but am to stay here, care free. Mother has been<lb/>
a wonderful sport, staying in her cottage all summer. Of<lb/>
course, the family going to see her, etc.</p>
<p>It seems now that I've &ldquo;waked up&rdquo; five years since my trip<lb/>
to Cleveland. I have been allowed no mail, no visitors, for<lb/>
so long. I could not be more stupid.</p>
<p>What of Kissinger? Just as well Mr. Law had that party when<lb/>
he did, with Kissinger and myself &ldquo;acting up&rdquo; as we did.<lb/>
Cleveland must be some town to mow the old folks down like it<lb/>
did us. However, I remember Joe! and where are all the &ldquo;firm&rdquo;<lb/>
that were so kind to me and were my body guards?</p>
<p>Mother is coming and stay with my brother here at 2810 for<lb/>
the winter. Do come by Washington. I would love to see you<lb/>
and your wife. As I am not allowed to go in any of the shops<lb/>
for quite a while (I'm sure I could and enjoy it) I have decided<lb/>
that I might give, if the plates have not been destroyed, some<lb/>
of those pictures in Cleveland for Christmas presents. I have<lb/>
two. You gave or sent me--I can't remember--The one I'd like<lb/>
would be the one they brought me yesterday from Blue Ridge with<lb/>
your letter. From left to right, Dean Cornwell, Dr. Hench, me,<lb/>
looking very sad, and Kissinger. It's a fine picture of &ldquo;The<lb/>
Conquerors&rdquo;. I have many of the newspaper ones from the Cleve-<lb/>
land paper, you remember, to the doctors at the Walter Reed<lb/>
and they were crazy about them. I've just been told about the<lb/>
picture sent mother. Did any one ever thank who ever sent it?<lb/>
If not, it's because the family have been nuts about me since<lb/>
June.</p>
<p>If you will be good enough to send me the address in Cleveland<lb/>
of the man who took the pictures, I will give you that drink I<lb/>
promised when you were to come back for that hous party last<lb/>
summer. God willing, next summer, and would you send me, please,<lb/>
Dr. Hench's address. I would like to let him know that I am well<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03828002"/>
again. He was sweet while I was ice. I could never<lb/>
answer a letter I had from him just before I was taken<lb/>
ill. Perhaps from the length of this letter and my<lb/>
writing so hard to read you may wish I had stayed a<lb/>
little longer at the Walter Reed Hospital. Do let me<lb/>
have some news of you and my old friends. I'll never<lb/>
forget that wonderful trip. With my very best wishes<lb/>
to you and your wife, Mr. Withington, Mr. Law, and<lb/>
Dean Cornwell, Many thanks again,</p>
<p>over</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
