<p>Hench thanks Redd for seeking permission from Carter's son for Hench to borrow the Carter correspondence. Hench offers to examine all the material himself and to treat it with respect. He is especially interested in correspondence between Carter and Reed, Lazear, Welch, or Sternberg.</p>

Mr. H. Carter Redd<lb/>
1104 Travelers Building<lb/>
Richmond, Virginia<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Redd:</salute>
</opener>
<p>How kind of you to write Doctor Carter in my behalf. I can<lb/>
assure you that nothing will be lost or improperly used. It will all be<lb/>
returned safely by registered or insured post. You state that it might<lb/>
be well for you to go through the boxes and &ldquo;eliminate a <unclear>lots</unclear> of private<lb/>
correspondence&rdquo;. May I respectfully suggest that you refrain from destroying<lb/>
anything. Although I am fundamentally interested in Doctor Carter's rela-<lb/>
tionship to Reed and Lazear and in the story of yellow fever, others may<lb/>
come along who will wish to write a more comprehensive story of Doctor<lb/>
Carter's life. In such event, his private correspondence would be ab-<lb/>
solutely invaluable. Even letters written by him to unimportant people<lb/>
about relatively unimportant matters are often invaluable to biographers<lb/>
and historians, as they give dates which show where Doctor Carter was at<lb/>
such and such a time. Often this is the only way the whereabouts of an<lb/>
important person could ever be established. Furthermore, such personal<lb/>
letters can give subtle evidence as to the character, humor and philosophy<lb/>
of a man and I beg of you that for the sake of those interested in Doctor<lb/>
Carter, not to destroy any of this material.</p>
<p>Should you have the time to go through the material, I should be<lb/>
of course pleased to receive whatever you wish to send me. If, however, you<lb/>
or Doctor Carter do not have time to do this and if, based purely on my<lb/>
position and reputation, you are willing to trust me, I should be glad to<lb/>
have the material shipped to me in toto, insured, and I will certainly find<lb/>
time in my hours away from work, to go through the material with respectful<lb/>
care. Please kindly permit me to see what concerns yellow fever and also<lb/>
malaria.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the material you are procuring for me will<lb/>
be absolutely invaluable and will show as has never been done before the<lb/>
exact part Doctor Carter took in helping Lazear and Reed to find the solu-<lb/>
tion to the conquest of yellow fever. I am extremely anxious to see the<lb/>
letter which Reed sent to Doctor Carter. I am particularly eager to know<lb/>
if there is any correspondence between Doctor Carter and Lazear, Welch, or<lb/>
Sternberg. Thank you very much indeed for your splendid cooperation. I<lb/>
am sending a carbon of this to you in case you wish to forward it to Doctor<lb/>
Carter.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
