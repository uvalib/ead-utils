<p>My distinguished friend, Dr. Hench:</p>
<p>I acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 5 and I am hastening<lb/>
to answer. I have orders to copy the following:</p>
<p>1. Copy of my picture &ldquo;The triumph of Finlay&rdquo;. 2. Copy of the<lb/>
studies in pencil of Doctors Finlay, father and son, Walter Reed, Jesse Lazear,<lb/>
James Carroll and Claudio Delgado, and of these the last one does not appear<lb/>
in the picture which I made for another objective. 3. Copy of the letter of<lb/>
Doctor Angles where he signs August 1, 1900. 4. Copy of two pages of the book<lb/>
of Doctor Francisco Dominguez Roldan about the second American Medical Commis-<lb/>
sion (the first one failed and was disbanded). It starts June 25, 1900 and<lb/>
it is started the Sanarelli bacillus until the month of august. Also the in-<lb/>
testinal flora. At the last they visited Doctor Finlay</p>
<p>I am grateful to you for your courtesy about the artistic license<lb/>
but in historical matters there is no such thing. I don't believe I have<lb/>
taken any licenses because always I try to document with proof from respon-<lb/>
sible people. The people represented in the picture were very much <unclear>discast</unclear>(?) discussed<lb/>
and I refuse to put Doctor Agramonte in the picture and Doctor Delgado because<lb/>
the historical data found showed they were not there.</p>
<p>Nobody believed in June 1900 about the transmission of yellow fever<lb/>
by the innoculation of a mosquito, the only one among three hundred species and<lb/>
Doctor Reed was among them. Nobody believed Doctor Finlay and he had been talking<lb/>
about this for many years and practicing his theory. The only faithful one was<lb/>
Delgado who cooperated with him in many inoculations and saw the evidence of the<lb/>
transmissions.</p>
<p>But there is something certain: It was to Cuba's advantage that the<lb/>
Spaniards did not pay any attention to Doctor Finlay because he became more in-<lb/>
dependent. It was better that the Americans were the ones to try to eliminate<lb/>
the mosquito that transmitted that fever because the Americans collaborated<lb/>
in our liberty and by such a great deal of good to this country. Cuba was<lb/>
saved and also the rest of the world. It is worthwhile to remember this. I<lb/>
am sending you a second remittance and I remain your friend and admirer.</p>
<p>Signed: Esteban Valderrama and Pena<lb/>
P.S. Now I am <del>a</del> only sending you Dr. Diaz <hi>Albertini pamphlet</hi> and two clippings<lb/>
from the newspapers <add>which</add> spoke about you.<lb/>
fled <unclear>under Albertini</unclear><lb/>
