<p>The experimental work <unclear>with</unclear> human material seeking<lb/>
to discover through what <unclear>means</unclear> Yellow Fever is trans-<lb/>
mitted, was initiated in early November 1900 by the Commission<lb/>
headed by Major Walter Reed Med Corps U. S. A.</p>
<p>Shortly before this D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jesse Lazear, one of its four<lb/>
member, died of the disease after allowing a mosquito<lb/>
to bite him at <hi>San Lazaro</hi><add>wrong P. S. H.</add> hospital Havana.</p>
<p>In his memory an experimental Camp,<lb/>
<unclear>Staffed</unclear> by Army personnel, was established on<lb/>
a dry breezy elevation near Havana.</p>
<p>We were quartered in tents and quaran-<lb/>
tined three weeks prior to the experiments. Temp-<lb/>
eratures were recorded three times daily- All<lb/>
remained well. Two buildings were<lb/>
erected for formites and mosquito experiments<lb/>
respectively the first was <unclear>unretreated</unclear>, except<lb/>
for a small front window, and <unclear>fenced</unclear> in<lb/>
<unclear>with</unclear> wire, A small stove kept <unclear>the</unclear> interior<lb/>
heated to about 90&deg; f, a maximum, and<lb/>
minimum <unclear>thermometer</unclear> recorded the daily range<lb/>
of <unclear>temperature</unclear>. Temperature's of the men were taken<lb/>
<unclear>t. e. d.</unclear> The Cont. Surg. and two privates <unclear>of the</unclear><lb/>
Hospital Corps who entered this building were<lb/>
the first &ldquo;experimentees&rdquo; in the camp and<lb/>
were not allowed outside the enclosure for<lb/>
three weeks <unclear>,</unclear> sleeping on army cots at night<lb/>
and remaining outside during the day.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03602006"/>
<unclear>sheets</unclear>, pajamas pillow <unclear>slips</unclear> and other material<lb/>
<unclear>soiled</unclear> with discharges from Yellow Fever patients who<lb/>
were ill or had died in Havana- were <unclear>brought</unclear><lb/>
to the Camp packed in boxes, on several occasions</p>
<p>Each <unclear>night</unclear> the men unpacked these and hung<lb/>
<unclear>them</unclear> on and around their <unclear>beds</unclear> and, at times,<lb/>
wore the pajamas- <unclear>Meals</unclear> were <unclear>brought</unclear> from<lb/>
Camp and left <unclear>outside</unclear>-- No one was allowed<lb/>
to enter the enclosure- There was <unclear>probably</unclear><lb/>
small tent outside- My memory as to <unclear>this</unclear><lb/>
is uncertain- Three details of men <unclear>lived</unclear><lb/>
in this building for 2, <unclear>days</unclear> each and no<lb/>
ill <unclear>effects</unclear> were experienced <unclear>with me</unclear><lb/>
were <unclear>Pvt's</unclear> Warren G. Jernegan and Lev. E Folks<lb/>
Hosp. Corps U. S. A. <unclear>Both</unclear> men are now dead.</p>
<p>To my knowledge none of the Americans<lb/>
taking part in these experiments accepted<lb/>
any kind of reward. Several Spanish<lb/>
volunteers were, <unclear>Dulin,</unclear> paid <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>100 to <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>200 gold,<lb/>
the <unclear>latter</unclear> sum if they took the fever. These were<lb/>
all mosquito experiments or blood <unclear>serum</unclear><lb/>
infections- in which Americans also par-<lb/>
ticipated. <unclear>Cases of fever</unclear> were transferred im-<lb/>
mediately to the Post Hosp. Columbia Bks-<lb/>
<unclear>there</unclear> were no fatalities.</p>
<p>The mosquito building was well ventilated and<lb/>
<unclear>divided</unclear> by a wire screen- <unclear>Both</unclear> buildings<lb/>
had double screen doors and windows<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03602007"/>
Volunteers <unclear>sleeping</unclear> for several nights on the<lb/>
mosquito free side were <unclear>unaffected</unclear> while nearly<lb/>
all on the side in which <unclear>infected</unclear> insects<lb/>
were released came down-</p>
<p>We in the other building were awakened by<lb/>
the Camp <unclear>Surgeon</unclear> about 2am on the<lb/>
night when a chill <unclear>signiled</unclear> Kissingers <unclear>at.<lb/>
tack</unclear>- All of us were <unclear>considerably</unclear> upset<lb/>
thinking perhaps <unclear>our turn</unclear> would be next<lb/>
This was the first controlled experimental<lb/>
<unclear>cases</unclear> of record.</p>
<p>The present <unclear>outer</unclear> had no official<lb/>
part in the conduct of <unclear>their</unclear> experiments<lb/>
<unclear>but</unclear> rated only as &ldquo;materials&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was <unclear>horseder</unclear> his duty to record <unclear>temp<lb/>
eratures</unclear> in the building and of the men<lb/>
taking part.</p>
