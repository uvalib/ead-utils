<salute>Dear Dr Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This is the first opportunity<lb/>
I have had to write you, so I know you<lb/>
will pardon the delay. I have been very<lb/>
busy since with Power Co.</p>
<p>I recently spent four days on the Bridgewater<lb/>
Pond with Mr Gage U. S P. H. S who has been<lb/>
assigned to N. C. to make a study of impounded<lb/>
waters. The present conditions are about as we<lb/>
found them last year. This pond seems a great<lb/>
deal clearer this year than last, as the places<lb/>
you recommended to be cleaned are now ok. The<lb/>
area below Catawba dam is breeding A. P. and<lb/>
I am going to make a careful study of several<lb/>
bites that may breed later on in season, although<lb/>
the pond does not seem to be breeding at all now.</p>
<p>I find Mr Gage a very good man to work<lb/>
with, and he seems to think a great deal of you.<lb/>

The Mt Island project will probably be<lb/>
completed by Jan 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> and the pond flooded during<lb/>
early spring. There seems to be a great deal<lb/>
of second growth in some areas of pond,<lb/>
and I think it advisable to <hi>cut this growth<lb/>
back for a distance of about ten or fifteen<lb/>
feet from white line.</hi> This cutting should be<lb/>
done in fall in order that none will grow<lb/>
back. I would like to have your idea on this.<lb/>
Mr Sutton sent you <add>copy</add> letter recently concerning Camden<lb/>
Court. He will advise you further as soon as<lb/>
he finds out anything definite.</p>
<p>I received letter from Dr Moddox's attorneys<lb/>
asking that I come over at once and make a<lb/>
survey for them. Did he ask you to come also,<lb/>
and did he ever pay you for your last survey.<lb/>
Please let me hear from you at once concerning<lb/>
this, and if he has not paid you I will try<lb/>
