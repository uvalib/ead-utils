<salute>My dear Mrs. Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was greatly distressed to have the note from Robert that his father<lb/>
was not well. I was consumed with the desire to get in touch with his physician<lb/>
at Walter Reed. I discused General Kean's problem with our urologists and was<lb/>
in the mood to suggest that he come here; then I realized that everything was<lb/>
being done for him that could be done and that he was in no condition to come<lb/>
here. I also did not want to let my anxious interest in General Kean be con-<lb/>
strued as meddlesome interference. Therefore I refrained and did nothing.<lb/>
This morning's telegram from Colonel Silor has grieved me greatly.</p>
<p>It has been one of the rare and richest experiences of my life to<lb/>
have known General Kean so intimately as he has been like a father to me and<lb/>
as I stated in my wire, I have gotten a tremendous stimulation and inspira-<lb/>
tion from him. He was one of the finest gentlemen I ever know. I shall hold<lb/>
him in reverent memory always. I shall never forget his voice, his chuckle,<lb/>
his graciousness, his utter devotion to the truth, his scholarly attainments.<lb/>
Many a time at 5 o'clock in the afternoon I think of him quietly taking his<lb/>
afternoon libation and I have often wished I could sit and watch him enjoy<lb/>
it. When I was there he performed this ritual with such a quaint dignity,<lb/>
as if he were silently toasting comrades of the past as well as loved ones<lb/>
and friends of the present.</p>
<p>This generation unfortunately, it seems to me, does not often produce<lb/>
the combination of dignity, scholarship integrity and worth such as he rep-<lb/>
resented. He was indeed a &ldquo;gentleman of the old school.&rdquo; Just the other<lb/>
evening I got out about forty letters which he had given me a couple of years<lb/>
ago, letters written by him from Cuba to, I believe, his mother-in-law. Such<lb/>
gracious letters they were. Indeed I was planning to have them all typed in<lb/>
sequence so that his son and you should have a copy. I should love to keep<lb/>
the letters but if you wish them a copy will suffice for me and I can send<lb/>
the originals to you or Robert. The letters were some of those which he<lb/>
found a couple of years ago in a <unclear>cellar</unclear> trunk and he sent me or let me take<lb/>
those which had any reference to yellow fever.</p>
<p>We are not left without him. We have wonderful memories which<lb/>
are rich and vital. Mary joins me in sending you our deepest sympathy<lb/>
and affectionate regards.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
