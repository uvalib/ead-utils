Mr. Landon Covington Bell,<lb/>
115 E. Rich Street,<lb/>
Columbus, Ohio.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Mr. Bell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been thinking about the mosquito survey of<lb/>
Colleton and I expect a fairly satisfactory way would be for you<lb/>
to take Theodore Hayne--the son of Dr. Hayne--and get <hi>him</hi> to<lb/>
make the examination of Anopheles breeding in<lb/>
(1) In the swamp, and<lb/>
(2) in it's environment closer to the residences of<lb/>
complainants.</p>
<p>He was working with us in July and August of last year and<lb/>
knows Anopheles larvae and how to get them. He will begin work<lb/>
with us again at Parr's Shoals June 15th. and should be suffi-<lb/>
ciently skilled both in finding Anopheles (both larvae and the<lb/>
winged insect--the imago) and in identifying them by the time<lb/>
you will want him--late July or August.</p>
<p>He could, and it would be better for him to, develope<lb/>
a number of his larvae out into imagos and keep them as exhibits,<lb/>
so that there would be no question as to the species and genus<lb/>
of the mosquitoes found. The same thing for winged mosquitoes<lb/>
caught <hi>in</hi> houses--which he will know how to do before you need<lb/>
him. On his finding of fact and these exhibits we (LePrince and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00803044"/>
-2-<lb/>
myself or any man familiar with the subject) could testify as<lb/>
experts, giving the proper deductions to be made therefrom as<lb/>
to whether the people at any particular residence would be be<lb/>
liable, or more liable, to contract malaria from Anopheles bred<lb/>
in the swamp or from those bred on their own premises, which,<lb/>
I judge, is the final opinion aimed at.</p>
<p>Of course, if Dr. Harris is available he can both make<lb/>
the survey and draw the deductions. I do not know what Dr.<lb/>
Hayne's knowledge of the breeding places and the different spe-<lb/>
cies of Anopheles is. he is a man of ability--decided ability--<lb/>
only I don't know how much technical knowledge he has on this<lb/>
particular subject. The same is true of Dr. Robert Wilson. I<lb/>
shewed himIAnopheles larvae at Parr's Shoals and I have no doubt<lb/>
that he would know them. Indeed, it may be worth considering to<lb/>
have either him or Dr. Hayne go with Theodore Hayne. He <add>Theodore</add> would<lb/>
know where and how to find Anopheles larvae and imagos and they<lb/>
should be able to identify the different species developed and<lb/>
found. Young Hayne would know anyway.</p>
<p>If you want Theodore Hayne please let us know as soon<lb/>
as you determine on it, as we will have to fill his place. In-<lb/>
deed this will be quite inconvenient, but since it would be to<lb/>
his advantage we would make out temporarily: 7 to 10 or 14 days<lb/>
should be longer thsn you would want him.</p>
<p>He will be working with Dr. T. H. D. Griffitts, &ldquo;Peake's,<lb/>
S. C. Care Parr Shoals Power Company&rdquo;--or, of course, you could<lb/>
notify his father.</p>
