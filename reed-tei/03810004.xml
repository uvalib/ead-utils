<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This is in reply to your personal request of May 9 concerning<lb/>
material relating to yellow fever in Cuba.</p>
<p>The following material has been found among the records of<lb/>
The Adjutant General's Office and the Office of the Secretary of War:<lb/>
<list type="simple">
<item>On yellow fever: outbreak of epidemics and precautionary<lb/>
measures to be taken; methods for treating yellow fever;<lb/>
data furnished by The Surgeon General in regard to its<lb/>
prevalence in Cuba; its existence among the Army of Cuban<lb/>
Pacification;</item>
<item>on Columbia Barracks: reports of surgeons; operations of<lb/>
post exchange; outbreak of yellow fever; post inspection<lb/>
report; concerning clothing supplies;</item>
<item>on Camp Columbia: reports of chaplain; post inspection<lb/>
report; reports of surgeons; births and deaths; repairs<lb/>
to buildings;</item>
<item>on Dr. Jesse W. Lazear: assignment to duty on infectious<lb/>
diseases board, 1900; report of his death; inventory of<lb/>
his personal effects; concerning removal of his remains;</item>
<item>on Dr. James Carroll: his movements and assignments from<lb/>
1891 to 1909; attendance at medical society meetings;<lb/>
report of his death.</item>
</list></p>
<p>also Dr Aristides <hi>Agramonte</hi></p>
<p>Thus far nothing has been found relative to Camp Lazear or<lb/>
the renting of San Jose Farm. We have not found the spot map of<lb/>
yellow fever cases made by Dr. Roger Post Ames in 1900.</p>

<p>When an Army hospital is closed (abandoned) all retained records<lb/>
must be shipped to the A.G.O.</p>
<p>When the Columbia Barracks Hospital was closed (1902 or 1903) those<lb/>
records must have been shipped, i.e. par. 1-3 below.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<head><hi>LIST OF RECORDS TO SEARCH FOR</hi></head>
<item>(1) Sick and wounded reports (retained) (very important). It is im-<lb/>
portant to find the entry in August 1900, regarding Dean for that month<lb/>
and also his entry for September (yellow fever). Carroll's sick record<lb/>
also, (Sept. and Oct. 1900) Camp Lazear cases December, 1900, February<lb/>
1901. (Columbia Barracks Hospital Report).</item>

<item>(2) Medical History of the post. This was a book in which the<lb/>
Surgeon noted, usually in his own writing, any unusual events that had<lb/>
transpired, in a medical way, during the month. Photos were often in-<lb/>
cluded. That book, if in existence, may give valuable information.</item>

<item>(6) Letters of Reed to Prof. Welch, Dr. L.O. Howard and others.</item>
<item>(7) The Library of Congress for publications of Army reports of<lb/>
General <unclear>Brooke</unclear> Wood, Fitzhugh Lee for 1899, 1900, 1901, 1902. These<lb/>
may be available in the Army Medical Library or in the War Department.</item>
<item>(8) Q.M. G.O. for <hi>maps</hi> of Camp Columbia and other Q.M. records.<lb/>
These may all be found in the separate inclosures that went with the an-<lb/>
nual reports of the Governor General of Cuba.</item>

<item>(10) A careful search of the Army Medical Library for other documents<lb/>
on yellow fever and possibly for Reed's retained personal records. When<lb/>
he died his office records must have been preserved and placed somewhere<lb/>
and whoever handled them must have realized their importance and may have<lb/>
put them in the Library or S.G.O. I don't think that a thorough search<lb/>
for them has ever been made. The Army Medical School might have them,<lb/>
but I doubt it. I doubt if Reed ever took such things to his home. Gener-<lb/>
al Reed could tell you of this.</item>
<item>(11) Among people to consult I suggest that you write General F.F.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03810007"/>
Russell at the Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass. Steward John<lb/>
Neate worked in Russell's laboratory in Washington for a long time<lb/>
and he may be able to tell you something that Neate told him about<lb/>
his work with Reed in Cuba.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Col. Garrison is dead, but he was a close friend of Reed's.<lb/>
Garrison wrote much of the text in Mrs. Sternberg's biography of Gen-<lb/>
eral Sternberg.</p>
<p>Others who know much of the story are General Ireland, General<lb/>
C. R. Reynolds and some of the older professors at Johns Hopkins.<lb/>
Don't forget the <hi>Welch Library.</hi></p>
<p>Has Mrs. Lazear any more letters?<lb/>
I support Kean's letter &amp; mine <add>to her</add> are not<lb/>
in existence. I think they would show <unclear>our</unclear><lb/>
feelings about Lazear's work and the importance<lb/>
of his discovery- Of course I do not know<lb/>
what I wrote to her, but I have always felt<lb/>
that my real sympathy for Mrs. L. was perhaps<lb/>
not expressed as well as it should have been<lb/>
because I <unclear>tried</unclear> to tell her how much<lb/>
his discovery meant. I never heard<lb/>
from her after that letter was sent, and<lb/>
do not think that Kean did-</p>
