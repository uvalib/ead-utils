<p>YELLOW FEVER INFECTION.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>An Important Statement Made by High<lb/>
Authority.</p>
<p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN--Sir: Your<lb/>
paper of Aug. 29 contained two articles on<lb/>
yellow fever which, being both well written<lb/>
and plausible in statement, may not be with-<lb/>
out influence.</p>
<p>This is to be regretted, as being a muddy-<lb/>
ing of the waters, at a time when the effort<lb/>
to handle the difficult sanitary problem in<lb/>
the South in a sane, sound and scientific<lb/>
manner should have the support of a correctly<lb/>
informed public opinion.</p>
<p>The fact that yellow fever was transmitted<lb/>
by a certain variety of mosquito and only<lb/>
in that way was demonstrated fully, conclu-<lb/>
sively and absolutely by the now famous<lb/>
and classical experiments of Major Walter<lb/>
Reed, Surgeon, United States Army, and his<lb/>
coadjutors in Cuba in 1900. His work has<lb/>
been thoroughly revised and tested since by<lb/>
competent scientists, notably the yellow<lb/>
fever expedition of the Pasteur Institute of<lb/>
Paris and the yellow fever institute of the<lb/>
Public Health and Marine Hospital Service<lb/>
of this country, with the result that all his<lb/>
conclusions have been confirmed; nor has<lb/>
there been any substantial addition made to<lb/>
them by subsequent investigators.</p>
<p>In the first article by Dr. Thomas J. Mays<lb/>
of Philadelphia the familiar &ldquo;not the only<lb/>
way&rdquo; doctrine is supported by two instances,<lb/>
both of which are perfectly explainable by<lb/>
the mosquito theory, but which can with<lb/>
difficulty be made to square with the theory<lb/>
of conveyance of the disease by clothing,<lb/>
which they were intended to support. If<lb/>
Mr. B. took yellow fever on Sept. 15 the<lb/>
mosquitoes which bit him in the three days<lb/>
thereafter would have been &ldquo;ripe&rdquo; and cap-<lb/>
able of conveying the infection by Oct. 1,<lb/>
and adding five days for the usual period<lb/>
of incubation, we should expect secondary<lb/>
cases to begin to occur after Oct. 6. In fact,<lb/>
three members of the family came down on<lb/>
the 7th, 8th and 12th thereafter. But the<lb/>
writer of the article prefers to trace this<lb/>
secondary infection to a certain cashmere<lb/>
shawl which had escaped burning after the<lb/>
death of Mr. B. and was discovered and<lb/>
destroyed on Oct. 5. And to the mere touch-<lb/>
ing of this shawl (which there is no state-<lb/>
ment that Mr. B. had worn) by Mrs. H. is<lb/>
ascribed the transmission of the disease after<lb/>
the most unusually short incubation period<lb/>
of two days. Compare with this the utter<lb/>
failure in the Reed experiments to convey the<lb/>
fever by bedding in any case, though non-<lb/>
immune Americans slept night after night<lb/>
in bedding upon which yellow fever patients<lb/>
had died and which was even soiled with the<lb/>
black vomit and other discharges. &ldquo;It is<lb/>
constantly observed,&rdquo; Reed used to say,<lb/>
&ldquo;that in infected cities yellow fever stops<lb/>
immediately on the occurrence of frost.&rdquo; Is<lb/>
it conceivable that the occurrence of a tem-<lb/>
perature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit out of doors<lb/>
will instantly disinfect all the houses of a city!</p>
<p>With regard to the other article, which<lb/>
advances the theory that the daughters of<lb/>
infected mosquitoes convey a mild infection,<lb/>
it need only be said that while there is no<lb/>
evidence in favor of this theory it is per-<lb/>
sonally known to the writer that the experi-<lb/>
ment was tried by Reed without the produc-<lb/>
tion of any fever whatever.</p>
<p>It is suggested that instead of manufac-<lb/>
turing new theories or resurrecting buried<lb/>
ones we take to heart the words of Sir Patrick<lb/>
Manson, medical adviser of the British Colo-<lb/>
nial Office, and the greatest living authority<lb/>
on tropical diseases, spoken shortly after<lb/>
the death of Walter Reed in the fall of 1902:<lb/>
&ldquo;Dr. Walter Reed did a great and beneficent<lb/>
work. We in England thoroughly appre-<lb/>
ciate this and heartily sympathize with<lb/>
America in the loss she and the world has<lb/>
sustained by his premature death. The best<lb/>
tribute we can pay to his memory is at once<lb/>
to apply his discovery. Let us hope that<lb/>
the good he has done will not be interred<lb/>
with his bones, and that his countrymen and<lb/>
the rest of us will take care to push forward<lb/>
the great and beneficent measures his bril-<lb/>
liant labors so clearly indicate.&rdquo;</p>
