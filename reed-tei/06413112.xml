<p>In the Wash. Post of last<lb/>
Saturday was what was to me<lb/>
a very interesting article-<lb/>
It told the story of Wallace W.<lb/>
Forbes whose name is on the<lb/>
yellow fever Roll of Honor, but<lb/>
who disappeared Nov. 24, 1926<lb/>
while in the service at San Francisco<lb/>
and has never reappeared to claim<lb/>
his gold medal or draw his pen-<lb/>
sion- I always regarded him as a<lb/>
deserter, but when I was preparing the<lb/>
Yellow Fever Roll of Honor in the account<lb/>
of his yellow fever attack I put in &ldquo;He was<lb/>
honorably discharged from the Army four<lb/>
years later&rdquo; This was perfectly true and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06413113"/>
2<lb/>
that was the end as far as the Medical<lb/>
Service was concerned- But in the<lb/>
Adjutant General's record of his service<lb/>
which is a very condensed statement of<lb/>
service is shown a reenlist in the line<lb/>
of the Army in 1916 and his service as Sergt<lb/>
to Nov 24, 1926- There is no statement<lb/>
as to why he left the service for his<lb/>
current enlistment had not expired-<lb/>
This article was written from data<lb/>
furnished apparently by the F B I says<lb/>
that the F B I has been working on<lb/>
the case for 17 years and have never<lb/>
been able to find a trace of him or<lb/>
any clue as to what became of him-<lb/>
He was carried for a while as A O W L<lb/>
but there was no reason to suppose<lb/>
that he was a deserter as he was a<lb/>
Sergeant in good standing with no<lb/>
Known cause for desertion- He could<lb/>
doubtless have gotten an honorable<lb/>
discharge if he had asked for it.<lb/>
The article says that the officers of his<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06413114"/>
3<lb/>
2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
GEORGETOWN<lb/>
WASHINGTON 7, D. C.<lb/>
Regiment (Co. I, 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Infantry) beleived<lb/>
that he had been made away with<lb/>
but there was no reason apparent<lb/>
why he should have been attacked.<lb/>
But some disposition had to be made<lb/>
of his gold medal and the pension<lb/>
has accumulated since the award<lb/>
28 Feb. 1929 to about $30,000 dollars-<lb/>
So F. B. I recommends that he be<lb/>
considered as dead and that his<lb/>
medal be given to a sister who is<lb/>
alive and married- The pension<lb/>
money goes back into the U. S. Treasury<lb/>
as he probably was dead at the time<lb/>
that it was graduated-</p>
<p>I cut the article out to send to you<lb/>
but when I came to do so it had<lb/>
disappeared and I have not been<lb/>
able to find it- Here are the facts<lb/>
It you want the article I can probably<lb/>
get a copy from the Wash. Post</p>

<p>Ac<lb/>
K</p>
<p>It seems to me a long time since I<lb/>
have had news of you- I have<lb/>
reason often to think of you at<lb/>
5 oclock- Where did you go in the<lb/>
very hot weather which you had<lb/>
in <unclear>Minn</unclear> last month?</p>

P.S.<lb/>
Do not assume from my envelope<lb/>
that I am sick at Walter Reed Hosp.<lb/>
The fact is that I am out of enve-<lb/>
lopes and Peru Indiana is slow<lb/>
in coming to my rescue.<lb/>
