<salute>My dearest Louise</salute>
</opener>
<p>We arrived yesterday morning after a<lb/>
smooth trip in the night from Key West and<lb/>
were met by a Launch with the indispensable<lb/>
Steinhart and Capts Butt &amp; Cole - and Major<lb/>
Runcie who took Baker off to his house.<lb/>
Steinhard took possession of Capt McIntyre<lb/>
&amp; me &amp; installed us at the Inglaterra in a<lb/>
bridal chamber where Mac is installed and<lb/>
a second room which contains my bed &amp;<lb/>
the bath tub! I let McIntyre use my tub &amp; he<lb/>
lets me look out of his front window &amp; so<lb/>
the modus vivendi is established. This elegance<lb/>
mind you is not at our own expense for we<lb/>
for the present are to have either actual ex-<lb/>
penses or a per diem to cover them - thank<lb/>
God. So bankrupcy is not added to the<lb/>
grief of parting from the dearest of wives.<lb/>
I breakfasted with the Laine's &amp; reported to<lb/>
the Secy who gave me a very <unclear>complimentary</unclear><lb/>
order to Dr Finlay to act as his &ldquo;aide&rdquo;<lb/>
in the same sense that Slocum was General<lb/>
Alejandro Rodriguez' assistant. It is to me<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fKAFP0020"/>
a very satisfactory relation as I am very fond<lb/>
of the old Doctor who is really a dear old<lb/>
man tho. I cannot understand more than<lb/>
half of what he tells me. I dined with Ladd<lb/>
<unclear>Crewdon</unclear> &amp; Mr Vaughan at the Dos Hermanos<lb/>
and Vaughan spend most of dinner send-<lb/>
ing nice messages to you. He asked if you<lb/>
still looked like you were fifteen - and<lb/>
Ladd hastened to assure him that you did<lb/>
Mrs Vaughan is in the states &amp; he is going up<lb/>
for her tomorrow. He said they were going<lb/>
to ask you to come back with <add>them</add><unclear>.</unclear> I told<lb/>
him he had better not as you would<lb/>
certainly take him up. We then rode up<lb/>
&amp; down the Prado &amp; the <unclear>malecon</unclear> in O's<lb/>
beautiful French auto for a while, stopped<lb/>
at the Miraman got a drink &amp; chatted<lb/>
with the gang that soon gathered. - Baker<lb/>
Capt. Shirley &amp; Horten &amp; Mr Greenwood - &amp; then<lb/>
I strolled up the Prado to the Inglaterra<lb/>
&amp; to bed after chatting in the portico with Mr.<lb/>
Davis of the N. Y. Times until I got cool.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fKAFP0030"/>
3.<lb/>
I have not told you half the things I did or<lb/>
rather the people I saw, all the Beneficencia<lb/>
people &amp; Dick Bullard &amp; Major Neville of the<lb/>
Marines who is camped at Columbia Bks &amp;<lb/>
little Posy. All wanted to be remembered to<lb/>
you and to know if you were coming down.<lb/>
This morning I went to Las Animas &amp; to the<lb/>
Palace. I have secured Pe&ntilde;a (you remember<lb/>
Dr Pe&ntilde;a) to be my interpreter &amp; assistant.<lb/>
He is all the special office force I will have<lb/>
at present. I suppose I can use a Cuban<lb/>
typewriter from the immense office force<lb/>
of the Junta Superior de Sanidad if I<lb/>
need one. Do you know in looking<lb/>
around for a place to put my desk I<lb/>
discovered that my old office was va-<lb/>
cant and I am now installed there<lb/>
with the soft east wind blowing on me<lb/>
from across the bay.</p>
<p>After Breakfast - I have unpacked my blanket<lb/>
roll and got out some good North American pens<lb/>
instead of these sharp Cuban things that I never<lb/>
could write with. I have also Pe&ntilde;a installed in<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="fKAFP0040"/>
4<lb/>
a desk behind me and am beginning to<lb/>
feel really at home. Pe&ntilde;a puzzled me just<lb/>
now by asking for my official title. I<lb/>
told him that he would have to give me time<lb/>
to make up one &amp; have it approved.<lb/>
There are only three mails a week now<lb/>
which is the reason why you will have<lb/>
quite a delay in getting this my first letter<lb/>
written from Cuba. They go Tuesday Thursday<lb/>
&amp; Saturday. I will write to the Chief by this<lb/>
mail also but you must go down to<lb/>
see him and exchange news as I<lb/>
am subject to so many interruptions<lb/>
that I fear his letter will be short<lb/>
I will send him a copy of the Secy's<lb/>
letter to Dr Finlay fixing my status for<lb/>
the present. Which I will ask him to<lb/>
show you &amp; give you a copy of<lb/>
Goodbye dear heart, I miss you constantly<lb/>
and will I know do so more and more.<lb/>
Give my love to the children &amp; to Carrie if she<lb/>
has come. I will send Martha &amp; Bob some<lb/>
postals soon. These cigar bands were given me by<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="fKAFP0050"/>
5<lb/>
Mr Merchant the vice President of Mr<lb/>
Vaughans bank, the Banco Nacional de<lb/>
Cuba - you see they have his initials in<lb/>
them being made to order.</p>
<p>I hope tomorrow boat will bring a letter<lb/>
from you. You have received by cable<lb/>
sent by McIntyre the news of my safe<lb/>
arrival.</p>
<p>I had a long talk with Dr Guiteras this<lb/>
morning at Las Animas and he invited<lb/>
me to come &amp; live with him there. I may<lb/>
do so for a while as his family is away<lb/>
but as long as McIntyre is at the Ingla-<lb/>
terra I will probably stay there with him<lb/>
but his stay will I think be short<lb/>
Ladd too says he is going home soon.<lb/>
The Secy will go the middle of the month<lb/>
when Magoon is safely installed.</p>
<p>With much love</p>
