Mr. William Wranek, Jr.<lb/>

University of Virginia<lb/>
Charlottesville, Virginia<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Wranek:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Such is the power of the press that one certainly has to be cir-<lb/>
cumspect and tell the truth! After leaving Charlottesville, I visited various<lb/>
friends in the East and Mrs. Hench and I were entertained one evening in<lb/>
Washington at the home of Walter Reed's son. A day later we visited Walter<lb/>
Reed's widow and daughter in Blue Ridge <unclear>Summit,</unclear> Pennsylvania. In Washington<lb/>
we also ran across another old friend of the Reed family. Believe it or not,<lb/>
every one of these people had already received newspaper clippings concerning<lb/>
my talk in Charlottesville, and if I hadn't said the right thing, it would have<lb/>
been just too bad. However, they were all pleased with the remarks. General<lb/>
Reed's wife asked me to obtain for her three or four copies of both the<lb/>
clippings. She wants to send them to her children and other relatives. My<lb/>
brother sent me a couple of copies but I have already used these and I would<lb/>
appreciate it greatly if you could get me perhaps four copies each of the<lb/>
the Charlottesville papers of Friday afternoon, November 14 and Tuesday,<lb/>
November 18, that I may send to these Reed relatives. Mrs. Blossom Reed had<lb/>
a nice clipping from some Richmond paper. Would you, by any chance, have one<lb/>
or two copies of that paper that I could have? If not, would you let me know<lb/>
what paper it is in?</p>
<p>I have an ulterior motive in receiving these clippings. They demonstrate<lb/>
to those who were kind enough to let me have their material that I am using it<lb/>
as they might have wished; that I am telling the story with due credit to those<lb/>
concerned and that I am appropriately using their memorabilia.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
