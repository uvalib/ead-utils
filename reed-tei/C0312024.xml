<salute>Dear Doctor Vincent:</salute>
</opener>
<p>As an addendum to my letter of this morning:</p>
<p>1: For some quite inexplicable reason, everyone I have tactfully in-<lb/>
terrogated seems extremely non-committal about the French Debt Commission.<lb/>
Indeed, the most &ldquo;garrulous&rdquo; statement I have so far been able to evoke<lb/>
was that &ldquo;if Mellon had been handling the business by himself things would<lb/>
probably have been pleasanter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is positively affirmed that the Commission was &ldquo;properly met&rdquo; by<lb/>
J. Butler Wright, of the State Department, on whom this duty always de-<lb/>
volves in the case of visiting celebrities--some of my informants stating<lb/>
that he went to New York <unclear><del>f</del></unclear> for the purpose, others that he met the Commis-<lb/>
sion here at Union Station. Of course, the historic incident of Smoot<lb/>
putting his feet on the table towards the end of the conference is too<lb/>
well known to repeat. Why there should be so much reticence on the sub-<lb/>
ject I cannot imagine, <unclear>would no effect on head should</unclear> seem endangered<lb/>
by the discussion. Still, that is Washington all over--things which would<lb/>
seem to warrent the Bastille broadcast from the house-tops: <unclear><del>app</del><add>oth</add>ers</unclear>, appar-<lb/>
ently quite harmless--taboo! If I ever hear anything of interest on the<lb/>
subject I shall not forget to let you know of it.</p>
<p>2: In regard to Dr. Ravenel's reaction to the data I showed you, you<lb/>
will find on Page 994 of the November Number of The American Journal of<lb/>
Public Health that he <unclear>is ill</unclear> adheres to his theory <add><hi>in</hi></add> <hi>re</hi> Nott and Carlos Fin-<lb/>
<unclear>lay</unclear>, but adds that &ldquo;the observation of Dr. Carter probably had much to do<lb/>
with Reed's return to that line line of study<unclear>--</unclear> (<unclear>of the mosquito transference)</unclear><lb/>
vector). Dr. Ravenel's article on Father is sincere and <unclear>generous</unclear> and, while<lb/>
I do not agree with him as to the part played by Father's work on extrinsic<lb/>
incubation, I much appreciate the spirit in which it is written.</p>
<p>Also, it is not a matter for controversy. The work of the <unclear>Reed overyd</unclear><lb/>
and that leading up to it and determining its direction (in which must be<lb/>
included that of Ronald Ross) was done, and <hi>well done</hi> by allc concerned and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0312025"/>
and<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
I only sent the data to Dr. Cumming, with permission to show it to Dr.<lb/>
Ravenel) because of Dr. Ravenel's request to the former. Father, as you<lb/>
know, cared solely for the satisfaction of <hi>achievement</hi>--and he was abun-<lb/>
dantly satisfied!</p>
<p>With best remembrances to you and your household, including Mrs.<lb/>
Vincent, whom I trust I shall some day have the pleasure of meeting,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
<signed>Laura Armistead Carter.</signed>
