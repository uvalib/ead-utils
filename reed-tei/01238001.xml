<salute>Dear Miss Carter:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been much interested in reading the correspondence of General<lb/>
Cumming and Dr. Ravenel. This matter is very clear in my mind. Reed, of<lb/>
course, was a warm friend of mine and with Lazear I had been working for<lb/>
a year before he went to Cuba on the study of mosquitoes and in the culti-<lb/>
vation of the malarial parasite (tertian) in Anopheles maculipennis. At<lb/>
the time when Lazear went to Cuba he was the one member of the Commission<lb/>
who was relatively familiar with the anatomy and habits, genera and species<lb/>
of our common mosquitoes. I am sure that when Reed laid out his work he had<lb/>
in mind the study of the mosquito question and at the same time, of course,<lb/>
he was more or less familiar with Finlay's work, but I am also sure that at<lb/>
that time he was not particularly impressed by it. I knew at the time that<lb/>
it was Lazear who first called to Reed's attention the significance of Car-<lb/>
ter's observations on the incubation period of yellow fever and I knew that<lb/>
it was this circumstance that turned them directly to the mosquito studies<lb/>
and back to the observations of Finlay. This I was aware of before their<lb/>
publication through my communications with Lazear and Mrs. Lazear. Much<lb/>
later Dr. H. R. Carter told, as recounted by Miss Carter, of his having show-<lb/>
ed his publication to Lazear and of Lazear's instant recognition of its sig-<lb/>
nificance.</p>
<p>These, it seems to me, are simply questions of fact. In a broader sense<lb/>
it detracts from the credit of nobody's work. Reed and Lazear would have<lb/>
been the last to have made little of Finlay's important observations and<lb/>
have, it seems to me, given him full credit. But the fact is that rightly<lb/>
or wrongly these observations had not impressed them greatly (They were sug-<lb/>
gestive but not convincing.) until the revelations of Carter's observations<lb/>
as to the incubation period convinced them of the probability that there was<lb/>
an intermediate host, that the intermediate host, because of the close analo-<lb/>
gy with Ross's work on malaria with which Lazear was steeped, and of the ob-<lb/>
servations and hypotheses of Finlay, was in all probability, a mosquito.</p>

<p>C1<lb/>
B20</p>
<p>On re-studying Finlay's work they naturally selected the mosquito which<lb/>
he had pointed out as the probable infecting agent. That this was the course<lb/>
of events I am as sure as I can be.</p>
<p>Believe me</p>
