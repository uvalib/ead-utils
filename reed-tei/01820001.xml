<salute>My dear Doctor Kean;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here I am,<lb/>
once more, at the very centre<lb/>
of civilization, with bones un-<lb/>
broken and health greatly<lb/>
improved. Many, many thanks<lb/>
to your kind care and gen-<lb/>
erous hospitality for this<lb/>
condition of affairs- My week's<lb/>
stay at Key West seems now<lb/>
like some bright dream;<lb/>
and I long to fall asleep<lb/>
in order that it may again<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01820002"/>
come back to me!<lb/>
Instead, I find that I must<lb/>
once more take up the mo-<lb/>
notonous thread of daily ex-<lb/>
istence and amuse myself<lb/>
with simian society as<lb/>
best I can- You can rest<lb/>
assured that I lost no<lb/>
time in trying my virus on<lb/>
one of these young apes, whose<lb/>
temperature, 48 hours after,<lb/>
is reported as 105&deg;- Have<lb/>
already begun the search for the<lb/>
&ldquo;bugs&rdquo; and expect a rare find!<lb/>
I trust that you received<lb/>
my note written on Board<lb/>
the City of Richmond &amp; that my<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01820003"/>
valuable memoranda, which<lb/>
were left in the table-drawer<lb/>
to the right of the door, are<lb/>
now on their way northward.<lb/>
Of course, you want to know<lb/>
something of my return<lb/>
journey along the Keys; and<lb/>
whether you really are pining<lb/>
for this information or not,<lb/>
I feel it my duty to enlighten<lb/>
you as to the advantages<lb/>
and beauties of this &ldquo;route<lb/>
to the Eastward&rdquo; -- this fas-<lb/>
cinating inward route<lb/>
along the Keys, where<lb/>
the water is smooth and<lb/>
the mango grows-<lb/>
Well, I must, as an honest<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01820004"/>
historian, tell you that the water<lb/>
<hi>was</hi> smooth, hardly broken by<lb/>
a ripple; and that there were<lb/>
colors playing on it worthy<lb/>
of an artist's brush-</p>
<p><hi>But</hi>, -- in order to enjoy this,<lb/>
one must be awakened at<lb/>
5 a.m. by the rattle of chains,<lb/>
and amid a chorus of orders,<lb/>
as the boat leaves her Pier.<lb/>
I had intended sleeping<lb/>
till 7 a.m., but instead found<lb/>
myself on deck at 6 a.m.,<lb/>
just in time to get a last<lb/>
glympse at your beautiful<lb/>
Island home, which was<lb/>
softly fading over the waters<lb/>
green! And then came<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01820005"/>
the Keys, the famous<lb/>
Florida Keys -- some of them<lb/>
beautiful enough, I'm sure,<lb/>
to be the Keys to a better<lb/>
world! I feasted mine<lb/>
eyes on them, and thought, &ldquo;well<lb/>
my good Doctor Kean was<lb/>
not far wrong<del>t</del> when he<lb/>
advised this journey, although<lb/>
I should have preferred a<lb/>
later rising&rdquo;! 7.30 am, --<lb/>
breakfast announced --<lb/>
now, my dear doctor, don't say<lb/>
anything about it, -- not for the<lb/>
world -- but if you do come<lb/>
this way, don't forget to carry<lb/>
your breakfast! The latter<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01820006"/>
was simply atrocious &amp; with-<lb/>
out excuse! I was delighted<lb/>
to get a little oatmeal porridge --<lb/>
and some bread &amp; butter. How<lb/>
I longed for an alligator Pear!<lb/>
When I had recovered from<lb/>
my disappointment, I found<lb/>
that the rest of the day passed<lb/>
pleasantly enough -- only oc-<lb/>
casionally an explosive &ldquo;<hi>damn</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
would escape, when I thought of<lb/>
that early pretension to a break-<lb/>
fast. We came to anchor in<lb/>
Biscayne Bay just at Sun-<lb/>
set -- the scene a really beau-<lb/>
tiful one -- and as I was<lb/>
tired and in need of sleep,<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01820007"/>
I turned in early, occupying<lb/>
a state-room on the other side<lb/>
of the boat, so as to enjoy<lb/>
the breeze. Horrors! I was<lb/>
just beginning to dose, when<lb/>
an Army of mosquitoes arrived<lb/>
with banners flying and voices<lb/>
attuned to sweetest music-<lb/>
I smiled &amp; reached for my<lb/>
little bottle of 8 pts. Camphorae,<lb/>
which you were kind enough<lb/>
to suggest as a shield against<lb/>
the hungry insect. Don't under-<lb/>
stand me to say that Camphor<lb/>
is not very good for <hi>some</hi>things,<lb/>
especially when mixed with <hi>other</hi><lb/>
things -- but as a protection<lb/>
against Florida Mosquitoes -- why<lb/>
my dear doctor, when they got<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01820008"/>
the first whiff of it, they only<lb/>
sang the louder, &amp; immediately<lb/>
went off and told their rela-<lb/>
tives about it! They swarmed<lb/>
all over me and begged for<lb/>
Camphor and with tears of<lb/>
joy &amp; happiness in their little<lb/>
blue<del>s</del> eyes, <del>they</del> bit me un-<lb/>
mercifully, while they laughed<lb/>
&amp; sang! I stood it just 5<lb/>
minutes, and then grabbing<lb/>
my apparel &amp; baggage, <del>I</del> beat<lb/>
a hasty retreat to Cabin 47,<lb/>
where I knew there was a<lb/>
Mosquitoe-bar. Even after I<lb/>
was secure<del>s</del> behind the net, they<lb/>
came in in troops &amp; begged me<lb/>
for &ldquo;more of that delicious perfume&rdquo;<lb/>
and when I told them that it was<lb/>
highly recommended by an Army<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01820009"/>
Medical Officer <add>against mosquitoes</add>, they laughed<lb/>
&amp; shouted, till I verily believe<lb/>
some<del>d</del> of them strained their<lb/>
<add>little</add> waist-bands! Don't recommend<lb/>
spts. Camphorae for the &ldquo;inland<lb/>
route&rdquo;, or was it, after all,<lb/>
a joke? Say -- &ldquo;honor bright&rdquo;?<lb/>
I have already forgiven you!<lb/>
When life is young and the spir-<lb/>
-its bouyant, early rising is<lb/>
said to be a health giving<lb/>
procedure and recommended<lb/>
as conducive to greater pecun-<lb/>
iary rewards &amp; c- Doubtless<lb/>
time enough- I shan't stop to<lb/>
dispute it- But when old<lb/>
age has come &amp; the blood-<lb/>
current slackens apace, there<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01820010"/>
are other things which har-<lb/>
monize better with one's thoughts.<lb/>
This, by the way, however --<lb/>
Thursday morning, I was awakened<lb/>
at 3.30 o'clock, &ldquo;because&rdquo;, as the<lb/>
Cabin boy put it, &ldquo;the other Capt-<lb/>
ain&rdquo; (meaning the Captain of the tender<lb/>
Biscayne) &ldquo;has a way of starting<lb/>
off without telling anybody about<lb/>
it&rdquo;! This was interesting! It<lb/>
is not necessary to say that I lost<lb/>
no time in transferring myself<lb/>
and baggage to the &ldquo;Biscayne&rdquo;-<lb/>
She did haul off promptly at<lb/>
4 o'clock in the midst of a<lb/>
terrific rain &amp; thunder-storm.<lb/>
I was beginning to worry just<lb/>
a bit for our safety, but just<lb/>
then the boat stopped, and when<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01820011"/>
I saw that the Captain had<lb/>
dropped a nigger &amp; a small<lb/>
boat overboard, in order to put<lb/>
out a light on a beer-keg (used<lb/>
us a buoy,) my courage rose,<lb/>
and I rather enjoyed the whistling<lb/>
of the wind and the flashes of<lb/>
lightning- Rounding into the<lb/>
mouth of Miami River, a little<lb/>
before 5 o'clock, and opposite<lb/>
the point where Hagler's new<lb/>
Hotel is being constructed, the<lb/>
scene was tropical and beau-<lb/>
tiful beyond description-<lb/>
I felt quite repaid for my<lb/>
hardships -- but when, a few<lb/>
minutes later, I found myself lit-<lb/>
erally herded in a common coach<lb/>
with a crowd of perspiring mor-<lb/>
tals who hadn't had a bath for<lb/>
a year, my anger rose and I<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01820012"/>
almost said something pro-<lb/>
fane! 2 eating stations advertiz-<lb/>
ed en route, but at neither was<lb/>
food provided that one could partake<lb/>
of -- arrived at Jacksonville nearly<lb/>
famished- As yet, my dear doctor,<lb/>
until <add>things</add> have become a little straight-<lb/>
ened out &amp; <add>the edges</add> smoothed down, I would<lb/>
advise against the &ldquo;Eastern Route.&rdquo;<lb/>
Found Mrs. Reed &amp; children very well<lb/>
in spite of the intensely hot weather<lb/>
here- To my horror<del>s</del>, also, found that<lb/>
Mrs. R. <hi>likes</hi> the <hi>mango</hi>! pronounces<lb/>
it a most delicious fruit, &amp; insists upon<lb/>
having her share! I have yielded, but<lb/>
not with a good grace. Mrs. R. is delight-<lb/>
ed with the guava paste- She joins me<lb/>
in warmest regards to Mrs. Kean &amp; your<lb/>
self &amp; thanks <add>both of</add> you so much for your kind<lb/>
thoughtfulness in sending the aforesaid del-<lb/>
icacies. I have written this, in the midst<lb/>
of untold interruptions- Whether you can<lb/>
get sense out it, I very much doubt. Again<lb/>
my dear Doctor, expressing my warmest thanks to your<lb/>
dear wife &amp; self for all that you did to to make my visit<lb/>
so pleasant, &amp; with best love for dear little Martha.</p>

<salute>I remain, sincerely yours,</salute>
