<p>Exam for<lb/>
army commision</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Physiology</hi>.</p>
<p>I. Enumerate the mucous membranes of the body,<lb/>
dwelling on the variations in their structure.</p>
<p>The mucous membranes of the body may be<lb/>
Enumerated as follows: 1. Commencing at orifice<lb/>
of mouth &amp; Extending through pharynx &amp; oesophagus,<lb/>
stomach, small &amp;large intestines, to the orifice<lb/>
of the anus. 2. Commencing at ant<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> nares &amp; exten-<lb/>
ding through larynx, trachea, bronchial tubes to the<lb/>
air Vesicles. 3. Commencing at meatus urinarius<lb/>
Extending through urethra, bladders, ureters,<lb/>
pelvis of Kidney into tubuli uriniferi. 4. In the<lb/>
female, commencing at orifice of Vagina, extending<lb/>
through Uterus &amp; fallopian tubes.</p>
<p>The mucous membrane of mouth also extends through<lb/>
the ducts of the <unclear><del>parotid</del><add>Salivary</add></unclear> glands. The mucous<lb/>
membrane of the pharynx is continued into the<lb/>
Eustachian tubes, lining the Cavity of the <unclear>Lympanum</unclear><lb/>
&amp; forms the int<hi rend="supercript">l</hi> layer of membrane Lympani.<lb/>
The mucous membrane of the nares is also con-<lb/>
tinued into the frontal sinuses, lining the antrium,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01615007"/>
is continued through the nasal duct to the lac<add>h</add>ry-<lb/>
mal sac &amp; through the lachrymal canals to the puncta<lb/>
lachrymalia. The mucous membrane of the duodemum<lb/>
is continued into the <unclear>ducted</unclear> commencing <unclear>choledicus</unclear><lb/>
&amp; into gall-bladder.</p>
<p>The structure of mucous membranes<lb/>
throughout the body present certain general<lb/>
Characters. They all consist of a thin homo<lb/>
<hi rend="underline">genious</hi> basic membrane, resting on a soft, fine<lb/>
areolar tissue &amp; are covered by a layer of epi-<lb/>
thelium, differing in different parts of the body.<lb/>
Besides they have certain glands, which secrete<lb/>
thier proper secretion.</p>
<p>To begin with that of the mouth, we find covering it<lb/>
a layer of squamous epithelium also provided<lb/>
with numerous small glands, whose ducts open on<lb/>
the surface by minute orifices &amp; are lined with<lb/>
glandular Epithelium. We also find a member of<lb/>
papillae, classed as 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> filliform, 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> fungiform<lb/>
&amp; 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> Circumvallate. Tracing the membrane<lb/>
backwards, &amp; reaching upper part of pharynx<lb/>
we find a columnar Ciliated Epithelium.<lb/>
(This is the &ldquo;Respiratory&rdquo; part of pharynx) for the<lb/>
lower part of the pharynx &amp; throughout the oesoph<lb/>
aqus we find the pavement Epithelium.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f01615008"/>
<p>At the Cardiac orifice of stomach, this epithelium<lb/>
ends abruptly &amp; we find the stomach &amp; remain-<lb/>
der of alimentary canal lined by columnar<lb/>
Epithelium. The mucous memb. of stomach is<lb/>
rugated &amp; is provided with a large number<lb/>
of glands, each gland separated from the other by<lb/>
a fine connective tissue &amp; a plexus of capilla-<lb/>
ries. In the cardiac pt. of stomach these glands<lb/>
are small &amp; straight &amp; the membrane presents the<lb/>
appearance of being divided into a number of diago-<lb/>
nal spaces. In the pyloric <del>orifice</del><add>pt. of stomach</add> the membrance<lb/>
is raised into ridges of papillae &amp; the gland are<lb/>
larger &amp; more fortuous. Throughout the stomach<lb/>
&amp; alimentary canal the mucous membrane is provi-<lb/>
ded with an abundance of submucous areolas tis-<lb/>
sue. In the intestines we find certain glands<lb/>
1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Lieberkuhn small, straight tubes, scattered<lb/>
throughout small &amp; large intestine- 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Brunner's<lb/>
racemose, lobulated glands confined to upper pt.<lb/>
of duodenum, each gland composed of a number of<lb/>
vesicles or little sacs, connected by areolar tissue,<lb/>
&amp; surrounded by capillaries &amp; <add>all</add> opening into a common<lb/>
duct. These glands are lined by the common glandu-<lb/>
lar epithelium. Besides these we find in small<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01615009"/>
intestine certain <hi rend="underline">solid</hi> <hi rend="underline">glands</hi> - scattered here &amp; there<lb/>
&amp; also collected together (the latter known as <unclear>peyer-</unclear><lb/>
<unclear>palthes</unclear>) - A thin capsule surrounds each &amp; the<lb/>
interior consists of small cellular bodies &amp; a<lb/>
plexus of Capillaries Lastly, we find the <hi rend="underline">villi</hi>of<lb/>
the small intestine- These project from mucous<lb/>
membrane &amp; consist of ext<hi rend="sup">l</hi> covering of <del>glandular</del><add><unclear>Coluemear</unclear></add><lb/>
Epithelium - under this a capillary plexus &amp;<lb/>
in the centre a <unclear>lacteal</unclear> vessel - we also find<lb/>
mucous membrane of intestine thrown into<lb/>
certain folds, called <hi rend="underline">valvulae Conniventes</hi>-<lb/>
The membrane of the large intestine is gathered<lb/>
into folds, forming pouches, by longitudinal<lb/>
muscular fibres.</p>
<p>2. Commencing at the Ant<hi rend="sup">r</hi> nares &amp; taking the respira-<lb/>
tory mucous membrane we find it covered by<lb/>
a ciliated columnar Epithelium &amp; provided<lb/>
with the ordinary mucous glands- for a short<lb/>
distance from <add>ant<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></add> nares the epithelium is of the squa-<lb/>
mous variety. The amount of submucous areolar<lb/>
tissue in the larynx is less in children than in<lb/>
adults. The ciliated epithelium <unclear>ceases</unclear> at the <add>air</add> vessicles<lb/>
These are lined by a thin membrane &amp; covered by<lb/>
a layer of <add>small</add> round<del>ed</del>epithelium cells.</p>
<p>3. Commencing at meatus Urinarius we find the<lb/>
urethra lined by squaumous epithelium &amp; provided<lb/>
with glands whose openings are directed for<lb/>
ward &amp; often arrest the passage of <unclear>cathetic.</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01615010"/>
We also find the orifice of a lobulated gland, known as<lb/>
&ldquo;Cowper's&rdquo; gland. The membrane of the bladder is rugous<lb/>
&amp; covered by squamous epithelium- at the base<lb/>
of the bladder the membrane is smooth. In the<lb/>
Ureter &amp; pelvis of kidney the epithelium is more of<lb/>
a columnar character.</p>
<p>4. The membrane of the vagina is covered by squam-<lb/>
ous Epithelium &amp; that of uterus and fallopian tubes<lb/>
by columnar ciliated epithelium. A peculiarity of<lb/>
the Uterine mucous membrane is the <hi rend="underline">Entire absence</hi><lb/>
of submucous areolar tissue, so that the membrane<lb/>
lies on the muscular tissue &amp; is with difficulty<lb/>
dissected off. The membrane is provided with a<lb/>
number of small, straight glands. The other mu-<lb/>
cous membranes do not present sufficient <del>ly</del><lb/>
peculiarities to call for separate description.<lb/>
That of <unclear>Lympanium</unclear> is lined by Columar ciliated epithelium<lb/>
II. Give the result of a vertical <del>section</del> incision<lb/>
made in the exact middle of the commission<lb/>
of the spinal cord.</p>
<p>Investigation has shown that the <hi rend="underline">motor</hi> <lb/>
fibres on reaching the cord, enter the ant<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; lateral<lb/>
Columns &amp; then pass up <del>th</del> the medulla oblon-<lb/>
gata, where they decussate. On the other hand,<lb/>
the <hi rend="underline">sensitive</hi> fibres <del>aft</del> decussates as soon<lb/>
as they enter the cords &amp; then pass up the<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01615011"/>
post<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> columns of the Cords- from the above 
distribu-<lb/>
tion of the fibres, it would follow that a vertical<lb/>
incision <add>made</add> through the middle of the commissure, at<lb/>
a certain part of the cords, would sever the<lb/>
sensitive fibres decussating at that point<lb/>
of incision, &amp; the number of severed fibres depen-<lb/>
ding upon the length of the incision. It would<lb/>
hence produce paralysis of sensibility in the<lb/>
parts below, but only <del>to</del> in those parts to which<lb/>
the <add>severed</add> fibres were distributed.</p>
<p>III. Give the minute structure of the kidney.<lb/>
The Kidney, <del>placed</del><add>is situated</add> on the side of the lumbar<lb/>
vertebrae &amp; in <add>post part of</add> the lumbar region. It is about<lb/>
5 inches in length - weighs about 6 ounces- its large<lb/>
end directed upward &amp; small end downward- is convey<lb/>
on out<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> surface- <del>concave</del><add>flat</add> on post<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> surface. Ext<hi rend="superscript">l</hi><lb/>
border convex- int<hi rend="italic">l</hi> concave &amp; presents a depression<lb/>
called the <hi rend="underline"><unclear>hibium</unclear></hi>, at which pt. the artery enters &amp; the Vein<lb/>
&amp; Ureter leave. The organ is covered by a fibrous<lb/>
membrane. The ureter as it enters the kidney<lb/>
dilates into a sac, called the pelvis &amp; this sub-<lb/>
divides into the <hi rend="underline">infundibula</hi>,which are 3 in num-<lb/>
ber. Each infundibulum divides into several<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01615012"/>
<hi rend="underline">Calyces</hi> &amp; <add>into</add> these project the apices of the <del>medullary</del> <add>pyramids.</add><lb/>
<del>This</del> The substance of the Kidney is divided into a<lb/>
central, pyramidal, or <hi rend="underline">medullary</hi> part &amp; an ext<hi rend="superscript">l</hi><lb/>
cortical part. The latter also dips down between<lb/>
the pyramids. The pyramids are from 10 to 13 in<lb/>
number, &amp; each pyramids presents at its apex a<lb/>
number of minute orifices, the commencement of the<lb/>
<unclear>tubuli</unclear> <del>unif</del> <unclear>Uriniferi.</unclear> tracing the tubes upward<lb/>
we find them branching at an acute angle. They<lb/>
are about 1&sol;500 of an inch <add>in</add> diameter &amp; are sometimes<lb/>
called the tubes of Ferrein. These tubes pursue a<lb/>
straight course <del>up</del> <add>to</add> the base of the pyramid<lb/>
&amp; then entering the cortical part becomes very<lb/>
<unclear>fortuous</unclear> &amp; convoluted. Each tube consist of<lb/>
a basement membrane &amp; is lined with a layer of<lb/>
glandular epithelium, which fills about 1&sol;2 the<lb/>
calibre <del>of the calibre</del> of the <del>Kidney,</del> tube. Some of<lb/>
the convoluted tubes of cortical part dip down<lb/>
between the pyramid &amp; return in loops, some-<lb/>
times known as tubes of <unclear>steule.</unclear> Each tube<lb/>
in both parts of the <del>covered &amp; from</del><add>Kidney is covered by</add> a fine<lb/>
connective tissue which serves to hold the<lb/>
tubes together. We find the convoluted<lb/>
tubes dilated at this extremities into bul-<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01615013"/>
bous enlargements. within this bulbous <unclear>eg</unclear>. We<lb/>
find a capillary<del>s</del> plexus &amp; this <del>forced</del> <add>constitutes</add> the<lb/>
malpighian body. Close examination reveals a<lb/>
layer of epithelium lining the extremity of the<lb/>
tube &amp; a 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> layer of small cells covering<lb/>
the plexus of vessels. The renal artery on<lb/>
entering the Kidney divides into a number of brand,<lb/>
which pass up the pyramids, form an arterial<lb/>
plexus open this bases &amp; thence supply <del>ing</del> the<lb/>
Cortical portion &amp; entering the <add>dilated</add> extremity of the<lb/>
tube to <del>supply</del> <add>form</add> the malpighian bodies. The vessels<lb/>
on leaving the malpighian bodies break up into<lb/>
a minute venous plexus covering ext<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> surface<lb/>
of the malpigian bodies, - thence pass toward<lb/>
medullary substance, form a second plexus<lb/>
(venous) over bases of pyramids &amp; from<lb/>
this straight vessels pass down the pyram-<lb/>
idal portion to form the renal vein.</p>
