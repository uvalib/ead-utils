Copy of letter to Mrs. Kissing inclosed-<lb/>
2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
<dateline>
<date value="1941-08-01">Aug. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1941</date>
</dateline>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>You will think I am a very<lb/>
poor correspondent and you are right<lb/>
but it is not from in di<add>f</add>ference.<lb/>
Your letter dated July 16 did not<lb/>
reach Wash. before the only delivery<lb/>
on that day which was Sat. so I<lb/>
went off with Mrs. K. that afternoon<lb/>
to visit my son Robert Hill Kean in<lb/>
Richmond and, as no mail was<lb/>
forwarded to us. I did not see<lb/>
your letter until I came home<lb/>
sick on the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and as I was<lb/>
not able to do much writing<lb/>
when I got better on account of<lb/>
the extreme heat with high humid-<lb/>
ity, it is only this morning that<lb/>
I am able to get to your letter.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06306002"/>
<p>AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
2</p>
<p>I will <xref id="t06306005">write</xref> today to Mrs. Kissinger<lb/>
and tell her that the thing to do<lb/>
is to make application to the repre-<lb/>
sentative of the Veteran's <del>Bureau</del><add>administration</add> to<lb/>
take charge of Kissinger and fur-<lb/>
nish him <hi>the hospitalization that<lb/>
he needs</hi>. I do not think that<lb/>
Walter Reed should be mentioned<lb/>
as an alternative because they do<lb/>
not accept (except in emergency)<lb/>
cases of this character, for which<lb/>
the Veterans <del>Bureau</del><add>Admin.</add> was created.<lb/>
For the years just subsequent to the<lb/>
war Walter Reed did admit Vet. Bureau<lb/>
cases as they <add>V.A.</add> were not equipped to<lb/>
care for them, but they supplied W. R.<lb/>
with funds to get the additional<lb/>
personnel <add>&amp; nurses &amp;c.</add> required and meet the<lb/>
other expenses. For a member of years how-<lb/>
ever the Vet. Bureau has withdrawn this<lb/>
aid.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06306003"/>

Since writing the above I have had<lb/>
a talk over the phone with (Mr. Sam<lb/>
Rose, no, I am not sure of the name) the<lb/>
representative at the Veterans Administra-<lb/>
tion in charge of such matters and<lb/>
he will mail a blank form of appli-<lb/>
cation to Mrs. John R. Kissinger<lb/>
telling her just what to do to get<lb/>
hospitalization for her husband.<lb/>
If she wants it she can get it and<lb/>
if she has any sense at all she should<lb/>
want it, as all his needs will be met.<lb/>
(without any expense to her as I understand)<lb/>
I have just left Dr. R. S. Galbreath<lb/>
out of it as he does not seem to be<lb/>
working for the interest of his patient<lb/>
if he leaves him to be cared for<lb/>
by an ailing old woman when he<lb/>
can have the hospitalization that<lb/>
he needs, for the asking.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f06306004"/>
<p>4</p>
<p>Your letter was a perfectly courteous<lb/>
one and deserved a prompt and cour-<lb/>
teous answer.</p>
<p>So I am writing her a brief note to<lb/>
say that I have heard from you<lb/>
of the calamity that has be fallen<lb/>
Mr. Kissinger and that it is quite<lb/>
clear to me that he cannot be<lb/>
properly cared for in a private<lb/>
home, I have asked the Veterans<lb/>
Administration here in Washington<lb/>
to offer her free hospital care<lb/>
in Indiana, or elsewhere, a<lb/>
<del>the</del> service which he has a right to<lb/>
by law. They will, I imagine, care<lb/>
for him in Indianapolis and<lb/>
arrange for his transportation<lb/>
there. I cannot write more today</p>
