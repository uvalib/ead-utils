Mr. Theodore M. Purdy, Editor<lb/>
Trade Books<lb/>
D. Appleton-Century Company<lb/>
35 West 32nd Street<lb/>
New York 1, New York<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Purdy:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been out of town attending medical meetings, hence my delay<lb/>
in answering your kind letter of January 20, expressing an interest in the<lb/>
book which I have in preparation on the subject of &ldquo;The Conquest of Yellow<lb/>
Fever&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Walter Reed and the Conquest of Yellow Fever&rdquo; or some more attrac-<lb/>
tive title). I am coming along with this book fairly well, but still slowly.<lb/>
I have probably collected 90% of what I eventually hope to have, but there are<lb/>
still one or two &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in my material which I hope to plug up this year. In<lb/>
the meantime, I have made a preliminary break-down of my material and find that<lb/>
it could be arranged in about 35 chapters. However, perhaps I had better com-<lb/>
bine it so as to make a smaller number of chapters.</p>
<p>I have not even begun to write the first draft; however, I have on<lb/>
occasion summarized the whole thing (in the briefest fashion) and given it<lb/>
as an illustrated lecture, which always seems to be very well received. The<lb/>
last time I gave the lecture was before the faculty and medical students of<lb/>
the University of Virginia Medical School (where Reed graduated) on the oc-<lb/>
casion of the Alpha Omega Alpha honorary medical fraternity barquet last fall.<lb/>
I did not publish the lecture as such but was asked for about 25 copies so I<lb/>
had it multigraphed and am sending you one.</p>
<p>I do not want to commit myself to any time or anybody but I do greatly<lb/>
appreciate the interest of yourself and Mr. McDermott. I have made no commit-<lb/>
ments to anybody else but Schuman, the New York Medical Book publisher, also<lb/>
writes me about it from time to time. On the basis of your broader coverage,<lb/>
I am certainly more pleased with your interest than that of Schuman.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely,</salute>
