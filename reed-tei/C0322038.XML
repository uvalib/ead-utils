<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The bibliographic work is still being pushed to the limit. In-<lb/>
deed, I accidentally went beyond it, from a physical standpoint, this<lb/>
week and had to work at home on dry toast and water--enough for mental<lb/>
pabulum, but not enough for work plus the trip to the Library. Thanks<lb/>
to Colonel Ashburn's kindness in letting me take books home, however,<lb/>
I've been able to clear up quite a lot of work here just as well as<lb/>
if I had been at the Library with Miss Brown. Miss Brown is indefati-<lb/>
gable, enthusiastic and most efficient. We expect to work together at the<lb/>
Library to-morrow (Sunday). Indeed, Miss Brown has come to my apart-<lb/>
ment every day I've been away, in order that we might check up our<lb/>
work and also to bring me additional material. She has then gone<lb/>
back to the Library to work for us at night.</p>
<p>Owing to insufficient data, the task of finding the places of<lb/>
publication of some of the medical references has proven much harder<lb/>
than I had anticipated. This despite the wonderful facilities of the<lb/>
Library of the Surgeon General and the interest and co-operation of<lb/>
that part of its staff specially trained in reference work. I have<lb/>
also, as I previously wrote you, written to, and consulted with, a<lb/>
number of men who should be able to help me verify specific references,<lb/>
and am continuing to do so.</p>
<p>Of course, the need for getting the book out as soon as possi-<lb/>
ble with the resultant limit as to the amount of time that we are<lb/>
justified in spending on the bibliographic work is why we have been<lb/>
pushing it so vigorously and for such long hours. Even at that, how-<lb/>
ever, there will remain references impossible of verification without<lb/>
a more lengthy search than is possible under the circumstances. Dr.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0322039"/>
-2-<lb/>
Dr.<lb/>
Frost told me it was inevitable, in an unfinished work, published<lb/>
posthumously, but that some of the references remain unverified. I<lb/>
hope, however, that some more can be worked up in the interval be-<lb/>
tween the time of the completion of the final editing of the MSS<lb/>
and the reading of the galley proof. Indeed, I think that nearly<lb/>
all could be verified <hi>with time</hi>--the thing we most lack! It would<lb/>
take a lot of time, however, and much research as whatever references<lb/>
remain unverified will do so in spite of having been worked over from<lb/>
many angles and by many people.</p>
<p>Had Father lived, he could have cleared up all remaining re-<lb/>
ferences as fast as he could have dictated them to me, for, as I know<lb/>
you remember, he always had an exact remembrance<del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> of the source of<lb/>
his references <add>including that from periodicals, letters and verbal communications.</add> Even as it is, however, I feel that he would approve<lb/>
of what has been done. To-day is his birthday.</p>
<closer>
<salute>With best remembrances, I remain<lb/>
Verytruly yours,</salute>
