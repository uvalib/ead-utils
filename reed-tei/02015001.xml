<title>Letter from George Miller Sternberg to Aristides Agramonte, May 14, 1900</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Sternberg asks Agramonte to settle a question whether the infectious agent of yellow fever is present in the blood. Sternberg also includes an excerpt of his report on Ruiz, which should help Agramonte's experiments. Included is a handwritten note by Truby.

<p>Walter Reed was in Cuba in<lb/>
Mch &amp; April 1900 and he saw<lb/>
the S.Q. no doubt early in<lb/>
May: I know that he was very<lb/>
anxious to conclude his<lb/>
Bicteroides Experiments by testing<lb/>
the blood of yf cases to meet the<lb/>
claims of <unclear>Wasdin &amp; G.</unclear> who had<lb/>
been working on the fresh <unclear>areas</unclear><lb/>
of yf in Havana.</p>
<p>It is possible that the S.G. was<lb/>
considering sending Reed to the<lb/>
P.I. just at that time as <unclear>Ravanel</unclear><lb/>
suggested, and this may have made<lb/>
the S.G. hesitate &amp; delay about<lb/>
sending Reed to Cuba. It is<lb/>
possible that Gen. Wood may have<lb/>
taken a hand just then.</p>
<p>Agramonte's letter from the S.G. was<lb/>
evidently written before anything about<lb/>
the Bd. had been decided.</p>

<p>I see by a recent order that you have been assigned to duty in<lb/>
charge of the Department Laboratory (Department of Havana). I trust<lb/>
that this assignment will enable you to continue your investigations<lb/>
with reference to the etiology of yellow fever. In doing so it is very<lb/>
desirable that, at the outset, <hi>a fundamental question should be settled.<lb/>
It has never yet been demonstrated that the infectious agent in yellow<lb/>
fever is present in the blood</hi>. On the contrary, the result of blood<lb/>
examinations, and of certain experiments, <hi>indicate that it is not pres-</hi><lb/>
ent in the blood of those suffering from the disease and that <hi>the disease<lb/>
cannot be transmitted by inoculating non-immune persons with blood drawn<lb/>
from the circulation of a yellow fever patient</hi>. If this question could<lb/>
be definitely settled one way or the other we would have very valuable<lb/>
information to guide us in pursuing our investigations in the future.<lb/>
If the blood of a yellow fever patient contains the infectious agent of<lb/>
the disease then we must continue to seek for this agent in the circu-<lb/>
lating fluid. If <hi>it does not we must look elsewhere</hi>, and our attention<lb/>
will naturally be directed <hi>to the alimentary canal</hi>. It is now well es-<lb/>
tablished that cholera is a toxaemia due to the presence of a special<lb/>
<add>Important letter written 9 days before<lb/>
yf Board <unclear>forward</unclear></add><lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02015003"/>
microorganism in the alimentary canal. The toxic products of which are<lb/>
<unclear>oed</unclear> and give rise to the symptoms of the disease. In this connec-<lb/>
tion I would invite your attention to experiments <unclear>made</unclear> in Vera Cruz, by<lb/>
<unclear>[unread].</unclear> Daniel Ruiz, recorded in my report published in the Report of the U.<lb/>
S. Marine Hospital Service for 1889, page 166. As you may not have this<lb/>
Report at hand I enclose a copy of that portion to which I especially refer.</p>
<p>Of <hi>course if you have an opportunity to repeat these experiments<lb/>
and settle this important matter <unclear>in</unclear> a definite way, you will bear in</hi> <unclear>miu</unclear><lb/>
the fact that they should not be made upon any individual without his <unclear>full</unclear><lb/>
knowledge and consent.</p>

<head>Report: Experiments of Daniel Ruiz, [n.d.]</head>
<pb n="4" id="f02015004"/>
<p><unclear>DEPARTMENT</unclear></p>
<p>CARDED.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTS OF DR. DANIEL RUIZ.</p>
<p>If the infectious agent in yellow fever is present in the blood, we<lb/>
would expect that the disease may be transmitted by inoculating a suscept-<lb/>
ible person with blood drawn from one sick with the disease. Dr. Finlay,<lb/>
of Havana, believes that the disease is commonly transmitted by Mosquitoes,<lb/>
which, after filling themselves from a yellow fever patient, transmit the<lb/>
germ by inoculation into susceptible persons. Evidently the most satis-<lb/>
factory and direct way of determining whether the infectious agent is pres-<lb/>
ent in the blood would be to make inoculation experiments in susceptible<lb/>
persons. Before going to Brazil I had considered the possibility of making<lb/>
this crucial experiment, and had determined to make it if opportunity offered.<lb/>
When in Vera Cruz I learned that the experiment had already been made in 1885<lb/>
by Dr. Daniel Ruiz, director of the civil hospital in that city. Dr. Ruiz<lb/>
is an entire unbeliever in the infectious nature of yellow fever, and had no<lb/>
confidence in the alleged discovery of a yellow fever germ by Dr. Carmona, of<lb/>
the City of Mexico. In order to test, in a practical manner, the truth of<lb/>
his views, he made, in 1885, injections of blood and of urine from typical<lb/>
cases of yellow fever, into the subcutaneous connective tissue of an &ldquo;unac-<lb/>
climated&rdquo; person. The result of these inoculations was negative. At the<lb/>
time of my visit to Vera Cruz he expressed his entire willingness to repeat<lb/>
these experiments in my presence. This was exactly what I desired, and ac-<lb/>
cordingly Dr. Ruiz made three inoculation experiments upon three unacclimated<lb/>
persons in the hospital. Unfortunately, the blood used for two of these in-<lb/>
dividuals was obtained from a case in which the pathological appearances did<lb/>
not <unclear>fully sustain</unclear> the diagnosis of yellow fever made during life. This case<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02015005"/>
<unclear>CARDED.</unclear><lb/>
<unclear>its</unclear> one of great interest with reference to the question of diagnosis, and<lb/>
I shall give a tolerably full account of it. The third inoculation was<lb/>
made from a non-fatal case in the eighth day of sickness; urine still albu-<lb/>
minous; skin yellow. Fifty cubic centimeters of blood was drawn from the<lb/>
median vein of this patient by means of a hypodermic syringe, which had been<lb/>
carefully sterilized. This was immediately after injected, subcutaneously,<lb/>
in the deltoid region, into the arm of a man aged forty, from the interior<lb/>
of Mexico, who had been in Vera Cruz only twenty days. The man from whom<lb/>
the blood was taken was apyretic, and the experiment is open to the criti-<lb/>
cism that it was perhaps too long after the inception of the malady. I was,<lb/>
therefore, anxious to make other experiments before leaving Vera Cruz, but<lb/>
the time fixed by my orders expired without my having had an opportunity to do so.</p>
