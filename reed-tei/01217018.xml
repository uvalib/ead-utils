<salute>Dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The Maddox cast at Union was continued until the February<lb/>
term of court and will probably be continued until May.</p>
<p>We had a very instructive meeting at New Orleans. The re-<lb/>
sults Coogle got with creosote were not verified by the ex-<lb/>
periments that Kmop and Theodore Hayne made. There was some<lb/>
discussion as to whether or not other species than Quadri-<lb/>
maculatus conveyed malaria in nature. Dr. Darling advocates<lb/>
controlling only the breeding places producing Quadrimaculatus.<lb/>
This aroused considerable discussion. From a practical stand-<lb/>
point it is not advisable to leave the other breeding places<lb/>
uncontrolled, because the public will not appropriate money<lb/>
to control only one species of mosquitoes. Besides that, I<lb/>
do not think Darling has completely established his case.</p>
<p>Our observations at Chester came in for considerable criticism.<lb/>
During the past summer I searched the daylight roosting<lb/>
places around Chester, at monthly intervals during the season,<lb/>
and found only Punctipennis except near one railroad borrow pit,<lb/>
I found one Crucians.</p>
<p>Dr. L. L. Williams, Jr., got away with murder. He said<lb/>
malaria in Virginia is caused only by Quadrimaculatus. Quad-<lb/>
rimaculatus breed only in ponds. Breeding in ponds can be<lb/>
controlled by fluctuating the water level, therefore, malaria<lb/>
can be eliminated in Virginia by fluctuating water levels in<lb/>
ponds. Some of the ponds around the army and navy base at<lb/>
Norfolk, and near pig <del>pond</del><add>point</add>s are saucer shaped depressions that<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01217019"/>
-2-<lb/>
had no outlet until we dug ditches. Artificial fluctuation<lb/>
of the water surface was out of the question. Fluctuation will<lb/>
also not control the breeding in seepage areas where quads and<lb/>
crucians breed at times. It is of course an important fact that<lb/>
quadrimaculatus convey more malaria than the other species, and<lb/>
our efforts should be directed principally but not exclussively<lb/>
against them.</p>
<p>Dr. Griffiths' methods of distributing oil on impounded waters<lb/>
is a valuable contribution to our knowledge of control methods.</p>
<p>I think in a year or so we will have some new mosquito cases<lb/>
against the Southern Power Company. They are planning to raise<lb/>
the Wateree Pond six feet, and are building a much larger dam<lb/>
on the Catawba River near Rock Hill. I fear that in spite of<lb/>
all precautions there will be an increase in malaria at these<lb/>
ponds.</p>
<p>I inquired about the letter to Theodore Hayne, and was advised<lb/>
that he had received it. I think he has written to you to that<lb/>
effect.</p>
<p>I hope you are getting along well and are able to keep up your<lb/>
work on yellow fever. We all missed you very much at the Con-<lb/>
ference. Please remember me to Miss Laura.</p>
<p>With the season's best wishes and kindest regards,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very truly,</salute>
<signed>L. M. Fisher</signed>.
