<title>Analysis of Basic Cost, Camp Lazear, by Paul L. Tate, [19--]</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Tate analyzes the checkbook stubs for Camp Lazear. He thinks that Lambert has reason to feel upset, because he nursed yellow fever patients and the only extra check made out to him was for $20.</p>

<list type="simple">
<head><hi>ANALYSIS OF BASIC COSTS, CAMP LAZEAR</hi></head>
<item>$ 220.RENT--Of this amount only $100. should be attributed to the<lb/>
original experiment.--During building and occupancy till<lb/>
end of experiment.</item>
<item><p>$ 492.MATERIALS &amp; STOVES--The amount spent for lumber shows that the<lb/>
tents were on frames and with <hi>T.&amp;G.</hi> floors.</p>
<p><unclear>{</unclear> Only 2 bldgs<lb/>
had <hi>T.&amp;<unclear>G</unclear>.</hi></p></item>
<item><p>$ 601.LABOR-The names of A.H.S. Burton and Cook do not appear, so<lb/>
I presume they did not remain after the Camp opened.<lb/>
John Morris was sent there after the Camp opened, but<lb/>
he evidently received no extra pay.</p>
<p>a special<lb/>
list of<lb/>
men will<lb/>
be added.</p></item>
<item><p>$ 570. SUBSISTENCE--This must have been in addition to regular Army<lb/>
rations, as there were too many men<del><unclear>s</unclear></del> there during four<lb/>
months for this amount to cover their maintance.</p>
<p>Yes</p></item>
<item>$ 518. UNIDENTIFIED--Payroll, cash, etc. No break-down of coverage.</item>
<item><p>$ 74. EXTRAS--Printing, etc. and $34.50 paid Capt. Stark for care<lb/>
of sick at Post Hospital. Dr. Ames was the only one<lb/>
I know of so treated from Camp Lazear. I would not<lb/>
consider this a proper charge to Experiment as he was<lb/>
entitled to such treatment no matter where he con-<lb/>
tracted his sickness. Perhaps it was cost of food,<lb/>
but he didn't eat there for <hi>81 days</hi>! So whom did they<lb/>
treat there?</p>
<p>All Camp <unclear>L</unclear><lb/>
Patients with<lb/>
y. f. were <unclear>treated</unclear><lb/>
at our Hosp<lb/>
(y f.) bills to P. H.</p>
<p>I have<lb/>
concluded<lb/>
that this was<lb/>
for the<lb/>
sick <unclear>civilians</unclear></p>
<p><del>81 days for all y f Patients</del><lb/>
<unclear>at no</unclear></p></item>
<item><p>$ 270. CLERK--This was a rational way to recognize Moran's sacri-<lb/>
fice, and it was the regular rate of pay for civilian<lb/>
clerks in the Army at that time.</p>
<p>OK</p></item>
<item><p>$ 36. DRAUGHTSMAN--If this was the McDonald who came from Washing-<lb/>
ton to make drawings for Maj. Reed, then two<lb/>
dollars per day seems ridiculous for expert work<lb/>
of that character, even if it was in addition<lb/>
to his regular salary.</p>
<p>I Expect<lb/>
this <add>was</add> extra<lb/>
of course he drew his<lb/>
regular pay too-</p></item>
<item><p>$3,729. COMPENSATION--27 checks covering all original volunteers and<lb/>
three others: Springer, Neate, Fruente. <hi>Springer</hi><lb/>
was evidently there all the time, and perhaps<lb/>
received the $100. for one of the pseudo mos-<lb/>
quito tests for his good work. He was a handsome<lb/>
fellow of intriguing character. Neate deservedly<lb/>
received $100. for a side-mosquito experiment<lb/>
as appreciation of his fine work and risks he<lb/>
took. <hi>Jose Fruente,</hi> $114.--para que? Maybe he too,<lb/>
had a little brown mosquito test. Kissinger,<lb/>
Martinez and Benigo probably received their $50.<lb/>
checks for blood donations and/or acting as <hi>con-<lb/>
trols</hi>. Kissinger did not receive his <hi>engraved</hi><lb/>
gold watch until much later, so this <hi>$200</hi> was<lb/>
probably paid him in cash even though he had<lb/>
asked no compensation. If so, he deserved it!</p>
<p>See my<lb/>
remarks<lb/>
OK</p>
<p>He was immune<lb/>
Reed thought</p>
<p>See.</p>
<p>yes<lb/>
was this<lb/>
paid by<lb/>
this fund?</p></item>
</list></p>
<p>These cheeck-book figures are very interesting and revealing of things<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06507044"/>
(2)<lb/>
I never knew. Of course, General Truby and Doctor Hench, with<lb/>
more inside information, these figures may be more illuminating,<lb/>
but, just through curiosity I have attempted to analyze them.</p>
<p>I know nothing factually about those Spanish volunteers except<lb/>
that they were there, but I notice a diversity of names in dif-<lb/>
ferent places regarding them: Yes<lb/>
The Senate Doc. gave me what info I had,</p>
<p>Check-book figures show <hi>two</hi> named Fernandez as receivers of $200.<lb/>
each for experiment. (Martinez as receiving $50.)</p>
<p>See my<lb/>
remarks</p>
<p><hi>Photostat list</hi> of patients at Camp Lazear show <hi>two</hi> named Fernan-<lb/>
dez.</p>
<p>Hench's?</p>
<p>Notes to picture, &ldquo;Conquorers of Yellow Fever&rdquo; show one named<lb/>
Fernandez and one named Martinez.</p>
<p>Gen. Truby's book shows one Fernandez and one Martinez.</p>
<p>Taken from<lb/>
<unclear>sen</unclear> Doc.</p>
<p>That is the only authority I have at hand. From it I would think<lb/>
that two named Fernandez was correct, being <hi>original</hi> entries;<lb/>
i,e, Ni cenes Fernandez, 4th patient, Dec. 15th, 1900-Jan. 3, '01.<lb/>
and Jose A. Fernandez, 6th patient, Jan. 2,-Jan. 13,1901.</p>
<p>He was used by Reed very much, more than any of the Spaniards<lb/>
<hi>Martinez</hi> does not appear on original List of Patients at Camp<lb/>
Lazear, which I have. He appears only on Check-book entries as<lb/>
receiving $50. only, so I would presume that he never contracted<lb/>
Yellow Fever at Camp Lazear. (This may well be a mix-up in Span-<lb/>
ish names, later solved by someone with better knowledge.)<lb/>
I don't see where Jernegan received anything for his mosquito<lb/>
test. There is $100. for fomite test, $200. for blood test, but<lb/>
the idea I received at the time was that each man received $100.<lb/>
for each test and $200. if he contracted the disease.. He re-<lb/>
ceived same amount as Folk who took two test<del>s</del>.</p>
<p>See S. Doc</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>I don't see any checks made out to Lambert except one for $20.<lb/>
for labor before experiment started. No wonder the poor fellow<lb/>
feels sore.--All that money floating around, given to Privates<lb/>
in addition to regular pay, and he taking chances every day,<lb/>
(before the mosquito theory was established) that exceeded all<lb/>
of them put together. He was practically a volunteer, as no<lb/>
nurse in Cuba, as I remember, was ever detailed to nurse Y.F.<lb/>
against his will. Lambert was <hi>an isolated untouchable</hi>, cut off<lb/>
from all mankind except Y. F. victims and Dr. Ames, and the<lb/>
only pay he received was as a Private of thee H. C.. A very<lb/>
great injustice, I would term it.</p>
<p>All Enl.<lb/>
men and<lb/>
officers<lb/>
were <unclear>required</unclear><lb/>
to do so.<lb/>
<hi>I did</hi> <unclear>so<lb/>
has</unclear> the<lb/>
case at<lb/>
<unclear>Juanajay</unclear></p>
<p>Total approximate cost according to Check-book: $5,505. But<lb/>
there are many items that do not appear there. For instance,<lb/>
I suppose all the bedding and clothing that Lambert consigned<lb/>
to flames on the other side of the cut, not having facilities<lb/>
to disinfect and wash them, (even if he had the time to do so)<lb/>
were Hospital Supply items. But it was extra expense and it<lb/>
seems should be charged to the Experiment.</p>
