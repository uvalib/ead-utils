<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>My colleagues and I are indeed grateful to you for your<lb/>
informative letter of October 26 concerning our proposed<lb/>
article for <hi>Virginia Cavalcade</hi> on the period of Walter Reed's<lb/>
life during which he resided in Virginia. Your comments are<lb/>
quite helpful, particularly your paragraph in which you dis-<lb/>
cuss Reed's alleged challenge to a member of the faculty of<lb/>
the University of Virginia. We are going to modify slightly<lb/>
our words in respect to that incident, though the article is<lb/>
already now in galley proof. I assure you that my colleague<lb/>
who wrote the manuscript, Mr. James H. Bailey, had consulted<lb/>
the biography by Laura Wood and the pamphlet issued by the<lb/>
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. He has also been inter-<lb/>
ested in reading the reprint by Dr. Arthur C. Jacobson, though<lb/>
of course it deals with a period of Reed's life shortly after<lb/>
that which we propose to cover. This reprint is being re-<lb/>
turned, as you requested, herewith.</p>
<p>I shall appreciate your sending or having sent to me as<lb/>
promptly as you possibly can a picture of the medical diploma<lb/>
awarded to Walter Reed by the University of Virginia and at<lb/>
least the two best of your pictures of the birthplace of Walter<lb/>
Reed, showing the spot before and after the dwelling was re-<lb/>
stored. These pictures should be sent to me, if possible, in<lb/>
the form of a glossy print, preferably 8" x 10" in size. If<lb/>
you incur any expense whatsoever in obtaining such prints,<lb/>
please have your photographer send us an official invoice or<lb/>
bill for them and for the postal expense. If you are willing<lb/>
to lend to us any of your originals of these pictures, we can<lb/>
pledge that they will be handled carefully and returned safely<lb/>
after we have had a short while to have our engraver work on<lb/>

them or to have our photographer duplicate them.</p>
<p>I am acting upon your suggestions in regard to pictures<lb/>
from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and from the<lb/>
United States Army Medical Museum, though the latter seem to<lb/>
be beyond our period of Reed's life.</p>
<p>We are indeed grateful to you for your cooperation. I<lb/>
look forward to seeing your brother on Thursday of this week,<lb/>
when I am to address the Albemarle County Historical Society.<lb/>
I will inquire of him then about the academy and the Reed house<lb/>
in Charlottesville.</p>
