Dr. Mazyck P. Ravenel,<lb/>
203 Hicks Avenue,<lb/>
Columbia, Mo.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Ravenel:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have read with much interest and pleasure your<lb/>
very <unclear>-discriminating</unclear> review of the Life and Work of Gorgas<lb/>
by Mrs. Gorgas and Mr. Hendrick in the June number of the<lb/>
American Journal of Public Health. The whole matter of<lb/>
Reed's work in Havana and the practical application of it<lb/>
by Gorgas is one of extreme interest to me as I was an inti-<lb/>
mate friend of both men and was in daily association with<lb/>
Reed during his stay in Cuba, I being at that time the Chief<lb/>
Surgeon of Western Cuba under General Fitzhugh Lee whose<lb/>
headquarters were at Marianao a few miles outside of Havana.<lb/>
I, in common with Surgeon General Ireland and most of the<lb/>
older officers of the Medical Corps, feel that this Life of<lb/>
Gorgas rather encourages the prevailing tendency to forget<lb/>
the basic and all important work of Reed because public<lb/>
attention was naturally riveted on the splendid sanitary<lb/>
triumphs which followed its application by Gorgas. Sixteen<lb/>
months ago when Mr. Hendrick published in advance in the<lb/>
Worlds Work the chapter &ldquo;Yellow Fever Meets Its Master&rdquo;, I<lb/>
wrote to him at the request of the Surgeon General and Mrs.<lb/>
Reed to point out the incorrectness of the statements made<lb/>
on page 110 et seq. We objected to the statement that Gorgas<lb/>
was the man that made clear for all time that the stegomyia<lb/>
and the stegomyia only was the infecting agent as this had<lb/>
been triumphantly demonstrated by Reed some months before<lb/>
Gorgas began his mosquito work. I also showed the incorrect-<lb/>
ness of the statement that Reed smiled at the idea of getting<lb/>
rid of mosquitoes and said &ldquo;It can't be done&rdquo;. This con-<lb/>
versation gives a dramatic element to the story but has not<lb/>
the slightest foundation in fact. Reed and I and most mili-<lb/>
tary sanitarians were familiar with Howard's use of kerosene<lb/>
before we went to Cuba. It is a curious instance of the ten-<lb/>
dency of periodical writers to value the story more than the<lb/>
truth that Mr. Hendrick did not take the trouble to correct<lb/>
this statement before bringing out the book.</p>
<p>I venture to take up your time with these matters<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06269041"/>
- 2 -<lb/>
because I think that it concerns the memory of Walter<lb/>
Reed to have the Chairman of the Editorial Section of<lb/>
the Journal of Public Health familiar with them. As<lb/>
fame is all that Reed got out of the conquest of yellow<lb/>
fever, I hope that you may find time to read not only<lb/>
this letter but the enclosed review of the book which<lb/>
I published some months ago and which brings out some<lb/>
other errors in the book although I dealt as gently<lb/>
with them as possible on account of Mrs. Gorgas.</p>

<salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute>
