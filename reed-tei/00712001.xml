<salute>Dear Ma:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Another week of Quarantine is<lb/>
gone. It isn't usual for any save a young<lb/>
person to be glad over the flight of time;<lb/>
but then it is not usual to be on Quar-<lb/>
antine &amp; so I am exempt by position<lb/>
from <add>the</add> observation of ordinary rules.<lb/>
I have a schooner from Havana - with a<lb/>
<unclear>foul</unclear> bill (1 case) in now; but it is really<lb/>
cold, blowing a norther &amp; one needs a<lb/>
blanket. Also a vessel on the bar - large<lb/>
schooner - due to drunkeness. I am not<lb/>
a prohibitionist, because I think it impracticable<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00712002"/>
but it is a vice with which I have<lb/>
<hi>no</hi> patience. So far as I can judge,<lb/>
it does more harm than all other<lb/>
vices together, if it &amp; the Love of Money<lb/>
were banished mankind, 99/100, of the<lb/>
suffering &amp; wrong done one's neibor w'd<lb/>
be out of it. This is moralising, but think<lb/>
of a vessel putting to sea, with Pilot Cap-<lb/>
tain, both mates &amp; quartermaster, <hi>drunk</hi>-<lb/>
really drunk - &amp; the crews - &ldquo;badly mixed&rdquo;,<lb/>
&amp; losing that vessel in a hard norther><lb/>
on Chandeleur bar &amp; any body will<lb/>
moralize. If the wind changes ever so lit-<lb/>
tle to the W. (it will hardly do it). She will<lb/>
break up in 30 minutes.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00712003"/>
<p>I went over to Ship Island Quarantine<lb/>
to see Dr. Champlin who was very ill, he's<lb/>
wife wrote. He is the Q. physician for Miss.<lb/>
I found the trouble less than she said,<lb/>
but, as at <hi>all</hi> the state &amp; county stations,<lb/>
every thing in the hands of subordinates<lb/>
trying to make money. <hi>He</hi> doesn't do it,<lb/>
but he doesn't attend to the work<lb/>
<hi>himself</hi>. This station is as far as I can<lb/>
see the only safeguard of the gulf<lb/>
between N. O. &amp; Tampa. You know<lb/>
<hi>all</hi> &ldquo;infected&rdquo; vessels are sent me from<lb/>
some ports &amp; all from &ldquo;infected ports&rdquo;<lb/>
by others. So the vessels that are subjec-<lb/>
ted to quarantine at local stations do<lb/>
not require <del>any</del> <hi>any</hi> &amp; therefore<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00712004"/>
C1<lb/>
B22<lb/>
the neglect is not dangerous. There<lb/>
was nothing wrong about the ship as first.</p>
<p>My fall work of construction, except<lb/>
putting in 6, chimneys, is pretty well<lb/>
over &amp; I am glad. You have no idea how<lb/>
many different kinds of things one<lb/>
has to know in places like this.<lb/>
When the Q. raises I want to go to<lb/>
Florida, long enough to see to my place.<lb/>
If I stay in this place next summer,<lb/>
I don't want to, Laura will go to Va: If<lb/>
possible to board in the Mountains. I<lb/>
was thinking that maybe the Randolphs<lb/>
in Nelsen could take her. The <del>trouble</del><lb/>
trouble about Geddes &amp; Belevet; is the<lb/>
size of the houses &amp; the in advisability<lb/>
of mixing up <hi>business</hi> &amp; <hi>kinfolks</hi>.<lb/>
She would of course stay with you as N. R. some<lb/>
but the size of the house would come in there too<lb/>
I expect, &amp; I want her to get to highland,<lb/>
what do you think?</p>
<p>Give my love to all, Little E. seems<lb/>
to keep well &amp; is growing again,<lb/>
but you are mistaken in thinking the other<lb/>
two are good, they are not, wish they were</p>
