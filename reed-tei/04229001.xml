he had failed to add the name of the Surgeon General (Maj. Gen. Bliss) to the mailing<lb/>

<p>The following officers were elected for the forthcoming year.</p>
<p>
<list type="simple">
<item>President Brig. Gen. Jefferson R. Kean</item>
<item>Vice president Maj. Gen. Merritte W. Ireland</item>
<item>Secretary Col. Joseph F. Siler</item>
<item>Treasurer Mr. Hans W. Ireland</item>
</list></p>
<p>The members of the Board were informed that Rear Admiral E. R. Stitt, an outstand-<lb/>
ing member of the Board for many years, had died two days previously, on November 13,<lb/>
1948. All members of the Board expressed their very deep regret and requested that the<lb/>
President of the Board write Mrs. Stitt expressing their heartfelt sympathy. (A copy<lb/>
of the <xref id="f04229003">letter</xref> sent Mrs. Stitt is attached to these minutes as Exhibit B.)</p>
<p>Consideration was given to the election of a member to fill the vacancy caused<lb/>
by the death of Rear Admiral Stitt. After some discussion of various possibilities,<lb/>
Dr. Fred L. Soper, Director, Pan American Sanitary Bureau, was elected to fill the<lb/>
vacancy.</p>
<p>Colonel Siler stated that the members of the Board would recall that at the annual<lb/>
meeting last year Dr. Hench had told them that he and General Truby recently had<lb/>
visited Fort Lesley J. Mc Nair (formerly Washington Barracks) for the purpose of locat-<lb/>
ing the building and room in which Walter Reed had died. They found that the former<lb/>
hospital building had been converted into <unclear>apartments</unclear> and that changes in inside parti-<lb/>
tions had resulted in some changes in the room. Dr. Hench recommended that the Board<lb/>
arrange to place a plaque or plaques in the building to indicate that date of the death<lb/>
of Walter Reed and other pertinent data.</p>
<p>This plan was approved by the Board. It was known that both Dr. Hench and General<lb/>
Truby probably would be in Washington in May, 1948. for the purpose of attending memo-<lb/>
rial exercises for Walter Reed to be held as a special feature of the Fourth Inter-<lb/>
national Congresses on Tropical Medicine and Malaria, and Col. Siler anticipated that<lb/>
he could arrange<unclear>,</unclear> at that time, for Dr. Hench, Gen. Truby and himself to visit Ft.<lb/>
Lesley J. Mc Nair, consult with the Commanding General and complete arrangements for<lb/>
installation of the plaques. Unfortunately, Dr. Hench was in Washington too short a<lb/>
time to permit the tentative plan to be carried out. Dr. Hench will return from Europe<lb/>
in December, 1948, and it is hoped that he will visit Washington during the next four<lb/>
or five months, in which case the final plans for installation of the plaques will be<lb/>
completed.</p>
<p>Col. Siler informed members of the Board that, recently, he had seen Mrs. Reed's<lb/>
daughter when she was on a short visit to her borther, General Reed<unclear>,</unclear> and had learned<lb/>
something of Mrs. Walter Reed's condition. She is now 93 years of age, has been bed-<lb/>
ridden for the past two years, is gradually losing ground physically and has to have<lb/>
constant nursing care. Mrs. Reed's income for the past few years has been approximately<lb/>
$315.00 per month (Government pension $125.00, anonymous donor $100.00. Walter Reed<lb/>
Memorial Association $90.00) and Col. Siler gained the definite impression that with<lb/>
recent increases in cost of living and expenses incident to nursing care, Mrs. Reed's<lb/>
daughter was experiencing great difficulty in &ldquo;making ends meet&rdquo;. To meet the exist-<lb/>
ing situation, upon motion duly made and seconded, the following resolution was passed.</p>
<p>RESOLVED, That the Treasurer of this Association be, and he hereby is, authorized<lb/>
to increase the monthly payments to Mrs. Emily L. Reed fifty dollars ($50.00) per<lb/>
month, beginning December 1, 1948 and continuing for not more than twelve months<unclear>:</unclear> and<lb/>
further, should the income of the Association not be sufficient to make this payment,<lb/>
that the Treasurer be, and he hereby is, authorized to sell sufficient of the capital<lb/>
assets to make such payments.</p>
<p>There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
