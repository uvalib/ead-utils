<p><hi>AUTOPSY ON THE BODY OF A MAN KNOWN AS ROBERT SHERMAN, AMERICAN, ENGINEER.<lb/>
HOME STATED BY HIMSELF TO BE IN NEVADA, WHO DIED IN THE HOSPITAL S. IZABEL<lb/>
OF A FEVER, DIAGNOSED AS YELLOW FEVER OR &ldquo;FEBRE <unclear>AMARELLA</unclear>&rdquo;.</hi></p>
<p>The bed, on which the body lay, was stained in the centre<lb/>
with a large patch, dark brown in colour, but with a few splatches of<lb/>
bright red blood and was said by the attendant to have been urine<lb/>
passed at death; the odour was that of urine.</p>
<p>I identified the body as that of Robert Sherman, whom I<lb/>
had seen during life.</p>
<p><hi>IDENTIFICATION MARKS</hi>. A complete double set of gold crowns in his mouth.</p>
<p><hi>Left Hand:-</hi> An old healed linear scar stretching from the hypothenar<lb/>
downwards and outwards over the thenar eminence for 4-1/2 centimetres.<lb/>
A linear scar in front of and below the knuckle of the first finger<lb/>
and a semi-circular scar over the knuckle of the second finger, both<lb/>
about 2 cms. long.</p>
<p>On the anterior external surface of the upper third of the left fore-<lb/>
arm there is an old tattoo of an American flag over an American eagle.<lb/>
Scar of an old bubo in the left groin 3 cms. long. Scar of an old<lb/>
healed ulcer in the upper third of the external surface of the penis,<lb/>
and a recent scar on the dorsum of the prepuce.</p>
<p><hi>APPEARANCE OF THE BODY</hi>:- The body shows marked post-mortem lividity<lb/>
especially in the dependent parts with marked congestion of the face<lb/>
and upper chest, the whole body being of a dirty occhre yellow colour,<lb/>
most marked in the conjunctiva, face, upper chest and both sides of the<lb/>
abdomen, but particularly marked round the region of the genitalia and<lb/>
the anterior upper third of the thighs. There is oozing of a brown<lb/>
fluid from the mouth and from the rectum a considerable quantity of<lb/>
this brown fluid, but mixed with bright red blood. The mouth and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01224020"/>
10.<lb/>
25/3/25<lb/>
posterior nasal passage contains a brown fluid.</p>
<p>An incision was made from the manubium sterni to the<lb/>
symphysis pubis. The subcutaneous tissues and fat were of a canary<lb/>
yellow. The muscles were pale and flabby but did not appear to be<lb/>
stained yellow.</p>
<p><hi>LUNGS:</hi>- Marked hypostasis in dependent parts, crepitant with apparently<lb/>
<unclear>ecohymotic</unclear> hemorrhages scattered throughout of various sizes and<lb/>
apparently of recent origin. They extended into the surface of the<lb/>
lungs. This was more marked in the right lung, which was adherent,<lb/>
latterly and superiorly to the parietal pleura. In the pleural<lb/>
cavities of both lungs there was a quantity of dark brown fluid.</p>
<p><hi>HEART:</hi>- In the state of diastole, the right heart containing post<lb/>
mortem fluid blood. The myocardium was yellowish and of a dull lustre<lb/>
but no eccymosis were seen. The endocardium, especially the papillary<lb/>
muscles were distinctly yellow. There was a healed sortitis of the<lb/>
first part of the aorta with calcareous plaques and calcareous re-<lb/>
solution of vegetations on the aortic <unclear>c<del>a</del><add>ar</add>sps</unclear>.</p>
<p><hi>LIVER:</hi>- The liver was enlarged. The surface had marked yellow and<lb/>
bluish mottling of fine design. On section very friable and a uniform<lb/>
dirty yellow.</p>
<p><hi>GALL BLADDER:</hi>- The gall bladder contained greenish bile and several<lb/>
stones but no occlusion of the bile ducts or of the hepatic ducts.</p>
<p><hi>KIDNEYS:</hi>- The kidneys were enlarged hyperaemic and of a yellowish<lb/>
brown colour. Owing to the enormously thick capsule of fat, firmly<lb/>
adherent to the true capsule of the kidney, it was shelled out<lb/>
entire and with ease. On section, marked hyperrhaemia of the cortex,<lb/>
especially at the junction of the cortex and medulla, while the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01224021"/>
11.<lb/>
25/3/25<lb/>
medulla itself was stained yellow and in the pelvis was a mass of<lb/>
bright yellow fat.</p>
<p><hi>GASTRO-INTESTINAL SYSTEM:</hi>- The stomach and intestines were involved in<lb/>
an enormous mass of bright yellow fat. The stomach itself contained<lb/>
a dark green content, the serosa appeared normal, the sub-mucosa was<lb/>
of a chocolate colour while the mucosa was minutely and intensely<lb/>
injected with ecchymosis at the cardiac end. The small intestines<lb/>
contained a similar fluid while the colon contents were more tarry<lb/>
in nature.</p>
<p><hi>BLADDER:</hi>- Full of dark brown urine.</p>
<p><hi>SPLEEN:</hi>- Normal in appearance, no infarcts.</p>
<p><hi>LYMPHATIC GLANDS:-</hi> Mesenteric and mediastinal were congested and some<lb/>
had apparently hemorrhages. The serous membranes showed nothing in<lb/>
particular. There were some ante-mortem patechial hemorrhages in<lb/>
the skin.</p>
