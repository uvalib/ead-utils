<salute>My dear Mother.</salute>
</opener>
<p>After seeing your train<lb/>
pull out from Jersey City this evening,<lb/>
I was inclined to be very gloomy.<lb/>
But it occurred to me that<lb/>
a better way to show affection would<lb/>
be to be considerate and unselfish<lb/>
when you are present rather than<lb/>
to brood over parting. I know<lb/>
that I have not been as<lb/>
considerate and unselfish toward<lb/>
you as I should have been.<lb/>
In fact it seemed to me that<lb/>
my going off on this trip was<lb/>
a piece of selfishness. But<lb/>
after thinking over the matter again<lb/>
I think that the present plan<lb/>
is best for each of us. It would<lb/>
never do for me to keep you here<lb/>
all summer, and it would not<lb/>
do for me to go away where I<lb/>
could not improve the time.<lb/>
You will be more comfortable<lb/>
where you are than any place<lb/>
where I could be with you.<lb/>
You must just take things easy<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00126002"/>
this summer. You must not put<lb/>
yourself out about anything, nor<lb/>
worry about anything. Just do<lb/>
whatever you happen to feel inclined<lb/>
to. &ldquo;Eat whatever your appetite craves.&rdquo;<lb/>
And don't do anything you don't<lb/>
feel like doing. If you don't<lb/>
feel well send for Dr. Fleming or<lb/>
some other good physician, and<lb/>
don't take any advise from Dr. Fulton</p>
<p>And above all, don't<lb/>
think of any imaginary dangers<lb/>
to me. An ocean voyage is not<lb/>
a dangerous undertaking at all.<lb/>
In fact there is not near as<lb/>
much danger in it as there is<lb/>
in living in New York during<lb/>
the summer months. The dangers<lb/>
of an ocean trip are of rather<lb/>
a spectacular sort, and are a<lb/>
great deal more thought of than<lb/>
they deserve, while we are<lb/>
inclined to overlook the much<lb/>
greater every-day dangers of living<lb/>
in an unhealthy climate without<lb/>
proper food and exercise.</p>

<p>Friday Night May 16,</p>
<p>I have just finished packing the<lb/>
trunks and I think that at last<lb/>
I have got everything in. Once I<lb/>
thought I was through and closed<lb/>
the trunks when I happened to<lb/>
observe the two thermometers<lb/>
hanging peacefully on the wall<lb/>
I have engaged storage for the trunk<lb/>
at the place on 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> St. I will<lb/>
send you the exact address to-<lb/>
morrow. They charge 25 cts a month<lb/>
for each trunk. I bought a<lb/>
steamer trunk at Hearn's for about<lb/>
a dollar &amp; a half. It holds all<lb/>
my things easily. <del>I</del> I will take<lb/>
my wrapper and heavy shawl.</p>
<p>Your telegram arrived this<lb/>
morning at 9:20, and I felt<lb/>
very much relieved to know<lb/>
that you got through the trip<lb/>
safely.</p>
<p>I was just barely able to get<lb/>
all the things into the three trunks,<lb/>
I had no idea that there were so<lb/>
many things.</p>
<p>Saturday morning -- Bright fine day. I am<lb/>
just starting out to finish up what business<lb/>
I have to attend to.</p>
<p>Love to all</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your affectionate Son</salute>
