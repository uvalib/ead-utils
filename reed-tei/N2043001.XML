<p>QUEMADOS SITUATION.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Dr. Stark Has the Fever Well Under<lb/>
Control.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Non-Immunes Have Been Forced to Leave<lb/>
Quemados and Are Living in Tents--No<lb/>
Danger of Disease Spreading to Camp<lb/>
Columbia--Eleven Cases.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>There is not the slightest occasion for<lb/>
alarm in the yellow fever situation at<lb/>
Quemados, and there is every reason for<lb/>
the belief of the authorities, and espe-<lb/>
cially the surgeons, that not another<lb/>
case of the disease will originate there.</p>
<p>A member of THE POST'S staff visited<lb/>
Quemados Sunday for the express pur-<lb/>
pose of learning all the facts in connec-<lb/>
tion with the prevalence of yellow fever<lb/>
there. He first visited the town and ob-<lb/>
served the precautions being taken there<lb/>
to prevent the spread of the disease. The<lb/>
little city was almost as quiet as a grave-<lb/>
yard. All the saloons which were opened<lb/>
when the soldiers first arrived were<lb/>
closed. These saloons are on General<lb/>
Lee street, where they could command<lb/>
the trade of the soldiers as they made<lb/>
their way to and from the camp. They<lb/>
were of a low order, of that class known<lb/>
in the states as dives. One of the wooden<lb/>
shacks adjoining one of these saloons<lb/>
where a case of fever developed was de-<lb/>
stroyed by fire, while all of the houses in<lb/>
the infected zone, which faces General Lee<lb/>
street and runs for one block back, have<lb/>
been disinfected.</p>
<p>Captain Stark, Surgeon United States<lb/>
Army, who was next in command to<lb/>
Major Kean, and who succeeded that of-<lb/>
ficial as chief surgeon of the department<lb/>
of Havana and Pinar del Rio on the staff<lb/>
of General Lee, is a young man, but the<lb/>
steps he has adopted in the interest of<lb/>
the public health has demonstrated that<lb/>
he is in every way capable and efficient.<lb/>
He has adopted a course which cannot<lb/>
fail to stamp out the disease, and in pur-<lb/>
suing his course has acted positively, re-<lb/>
fusing to be influenced by the protests or<lb/>
appeals of those who have been com-<lb/>
pelled to obey his instructions.</p>
<p>When he assumed charge of the chief<lb/>
surgeon's office quarantine measures<lb/>
were already in force, but these he ex-<lb/>
tended and made more severe. Soldiers<lb/>
are not permitted to enter the city unless<lb/>
they are provided with passes, and every<lb/>
soldier who is absent from his command<lb/>
without leave for six <unclear>hours is </unclear>arrested<lb/>
and<unclear> sent </unclear>to the detention <unclear>[unclear]</unclear> up, where<lb/>
<unclear>[unclear]</unclear><lb/>
five days and where he is given work on<lb/>
the new road by way of exercise. All of<lb/>
the civilian employes of the government<lb/>
have been moved from the city and are<lb/>
in a camp of detention near the post hos-<lb/>
pital. They are constantly under sur-<lb/>
veillance and their temperatures are<lb/>
taken three times each day. All civilian<lb/>
non-immunes who were living in the city<lb/>
have been moved to a camp about one<lb/>
half mile this side of the city, where they<lb/>
are pleasantly situated on a hill and<lb/>
where they have been provided with<lb/>
tents well-floored. They are fed by the<lb/>
quartermaster's department, being al-<lb/>
lowed everything they desire, even in-<lb/>
cluding candy for the children. Dr. Stark<lb/>
visits them every day and exercises great<lb/>
care in looking after their welfare. There<lb/>
are thirty people at this camp.</p>
<p>Those who are detained at the camp<lb/>
will be kept there for a period of five<lb/>
days dating from Sunday morning, and<lb/>
will then be permitted to go where they<lb/>
please. In the event that none of them<lb/>
have homes they will be permitted to re-<lb/>
main at the camp and will continue to<lb/>
draw the same rations which they at<lb/>
present receive. They will not be per-<lb/>
mitted to return to Quemados, as no civ-<lb/>
ilian non-immune will be permitted to<lb/>
live in the city until after November 1st.<lb/>
Those connected with the surgeon's de-<lb/>
partment claim that this will have the<lb/>
effect of completely stamping out the<lb/>
disease, since there will be no material<lb/>
upon which to feed.</p>
<p>As to the prevalence of fever among<lb/>
the troops at Camp Columbia there is<lb/>
absolutely no danger. Abundant pre-<lb/>
cautions have been taken and the condi-<lb/>
tion of the camp is clean. As to sanita-<lb/>
tion, Camp Columbia is an ideal camp.<lb/>
There is a complete system of sewerage<lb/>
and the greatest care has been taken to<lb/>
keep the camp clean. The reporter spent<lb/>
over an hour at the camp and made a<lb/>
thorough investigation of the barracks,<lb/>
kitchens, sinks, etc. There is not a place<lb/>
around the camp which is not in a perfect<lb/>
sanitary condition. Yellow fever could<lb/>
not live in such a place.</p>
<p>A few soldiers have been taken sick<lb/>
with the disease, but in every instance<lb/>
their exposure has been traced to the in-<lb/>
fected zone at Quemados. The troops<lb/>
are in no danger whatever.</p>
<p>The record of yellow fever since it first<lb/>
originated shows the infected zone to<lb/>
have been confined to the district within<lb/>
the ropes. There have been twenty-six<lb/>
cases since the 24th of May. There are<lb/>
now eleven cases under treatment at the<lb/>
hospitals, as follows:</p>
<p>Major Kean, chief surgeon of the de-<lb/>
partment of Havana and Pinar del Rio,<lb/>
who acquired the disease while living in<lb/>
the infected zone.</p>
<p>Captain Hepburn, who lived in the in-<lb/>
fected zone.</p>
<p>John D. Sutton, civilian, clerk of Major<lb/>
Kean, who lived in the infected zone.</p>
<p>Mac Olsen, civilian, carpenter, who<lb/>
spent several days with a friend in the<lb/>
infected zone.</p>
<p>Frank Keating, civilian employe of the<lb/>
corral, who acquired the fever from ex-<lb/>
posure at Quemados.</p>
<p>Thomas Carter, private in the signal<lb/>
corps, who lived in the same house as<lb/>
Captain Hepburn in the infected zone.</p>
<p>John Marfardt, German civilian car-<lb/>
penter, who was employed by an engi-<lb/>
neering company, and who was taken<lb/>
sick almost as soon as he arrived at<lb/>
Quemados. It is believed that he con-<lb/>
tracted the disease on San Ignacio<lb/>
street, where he lived.</p>
<p>A tailor by the name of Hamburg, who<lb/>
had a tailor shop in the infected zone.</p>
<p>Chas. J. Marhefka, a private of Troop<lb/>
B. Seventh Cavalry, who was a friend<lb/>
of Hamburg, and who spent much time<lb/>
in his shop.</p>
<p>A French woman, whose name was<lb/>
not obtained, who lived in the infected<lb/>
zone and who is in the hospital some dis-<lb/>
tance from the camp of detention.</p>
<p>A teamster, who contracted the dis-<lb/>
ease in Quemados.</p>
<p>The deaths which have occurred since<lb/>
the disease broke out are as follows:</p>
<p>Major Frank H. Edmunds, acting in-<lb/>
spector general on the staff of General<lb/>
Lee.</p>
<p>John Lutz, an Austrian who ran a<lb/>
restaurant on General Lee street.</p>
<p>Two Suzer brothers, Austrian tailors,<lb/>
who had a shop on General Lee street.</p>
<p>Mrs. Finn, an American lady aged<lb/>
eighty years, who lived in Quemados.</p>
<p>The hospital facilities are good. At<lb/>
the post yellow fever hospital there are<lb/>
two immune doctors, six female immune<lb/>
nurses and six non-immune corps boys,<lb/>
who volunteered their services to wait<lb/>
upon the sick.</p>
<p>The surgeons have endeavored to have<lb/>
General Lee leave the palace for the sum-<lb/>
mer for fear he will contract the disease,<lb/>
but the General has positively refused to<lb/>
do so.</p>
<p>The reporter visited Quemados in re-<lb/>
sponse to an invitation from General<lb/>
Lee and was accorded every facility by<lb/>
the General and his staff for pursuing<lb/>
his inquiry.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>A good many Cuban passengers sailed<lb/>
on the Plant steamer which left here yes-<lb/>
terday for Port Tampa. Most of them<lb/>
are going to Tampa to spend the sum-<lb/>
mer with relatives.</p>
