<p>Absence December 2, 3 and 4. I rediscovered Camp Lazear (which had been<lb/>
&ldquo;lost&rdquo; for 40 years) in 1940 and have made many trips there in order to<lb/>
interest the Cubans to preserve the Camp. Several times they have been on<lb/>
the verge of memorializing it but the plans always fall through. The<lb/>
various governments who made promises to me were voted or thrown out of<lb/>
office. Their plans to go ahead with the job and finish it were decided<lb/>
rather suddenly this spring. I had hoped that the dedication would<lb/>
be held off until next spring but they have gone ahead, made the park,<lb/>
put in streets and so on this summer and are hoping to dedicate it on<lb/>
&ldquo;Physicians Day&rdquo; in Havana, December 3. I have been invited by the Cuban<lb/>
government to attend and to speak at the dedication of the Camp.</p>
<p>This is no place to discuss the following but the Cubans need very much the<lb/>
friendly approval of American medicine in this venture. I believe this can<lb/>
properly be called a medical trip as the dedication is sponsored by the<lb/>
Ministry of Health of Cuba and the correspondence to me comes from the agent<lb/>
of the Ministry of Health, who is also a physician. I will fly both ways<lb/>
and the absence will total only about three or four days - no more</p>
