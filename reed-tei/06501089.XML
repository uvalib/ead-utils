<salute>Dear Tate,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciated your letter of<lb/>
Nov. 29 very <add>much</add> and regret that the holiday<lb/>
season and other things caused me<lb/>
to put off letter writing to a great<lb/>
extent.</p>
<p>I enjoyed your reminiscing about<lb/>
the &ldquo;Cuban atmosphere&rdquo; we found these 50<lb/>
years ago. You may be sure it stands<lb/>
out most clearly and pleasantly in my<lb/>
memory as it does in yours.</p>
<p>You asked about Capt. Stark. He become<lb/>
one of the best friends I have ever had. When<lb/>
he left Cuba he went to West Point for duty.<lb/>
There he did all of the surgery and was<lb/>
soon worked to death. Then he ask the<lb/>
S.G. to send me there as his asst. We<lb/>
made a good team, I think, &amp; got away with<lb/>
a big job in excellent shape. I was with<lb/>
him until I became a Capt. and then<lb/>
the S.G. sent me to a station of my own<lb/>
on the Pacific Coast. After that Stark &amp; I did<lb/>
not serve together. He was the Chief Surgeon<lb/>
of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Army in France during World War I<lb/>
and did wonderful work. <del>she</del><add>He</add> should have<lb/>
been made a General Officer, but some one<lb/>
who was not friendly to Stark, blocked it.<lb/>

C<hi rend="subscript">2</hi><lb/>
B<hi rend="subscript">7</hi><lb/>
After that he was sent to Texas for<lb/>
duty and was heartbroken and soon<lb/>
was retired for phisical disability <add>heart</add> I think.<lb/>
while I was in Command of the Letterman<lb/>
Hospital in San Francisco in 1922 or '23 he<lb/>
sent me a telegram asking if we had<lb/>
a room for him in the hospital as<lb/>
he was sick. I answered at once, and<lb/>
urged him to come as we had a fine<lb/>
heart specialist. A day or so later I<lb/>
received word that he died soon after<lb/>
my telegram came. He was a grand person<lb/>
and a most efficient Medical Officer. He<lb/>
did more for me in many ways than<lb/>
anyone else I have ever served with.<lb/>
I recommended that he be one of the<lb/>
persons in the Wyeth painting, but the<lb/>
people who decided the matter chose me<lb/>
instead as Stark had left Cuba before<lb/>
Lazear's work with mosquitoes brought results.<lb/>
I was there at that time and during the<lb/>
establishment of Camp Lazear. As C.O. I was<lb/>
included among the others who were selected.<lb/>
I am glad that Wyeth. Inc sent you<lb/>
a large copy. I was also given a copy<lb/>
marked No. 5</p>
<p>I hope you will find a copy of my<lb/>
book. I think you will and then you<lb/>
can review what I said about Dr. Ames, Lambert,<lb/>
Mrs Warner and others who <add>did</add> great work, but<lb/>
could not be included on the Roll of Honor.<lb/>
When you write again tell me what<lb/>
you are doing in Berkely and how things are<lb/>
going with you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>With best wishes<lb/>
Very Sincerely</salute>
