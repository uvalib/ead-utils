<salute>My dear Mother-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here we are<lb/>
in Strassburg. We left Frei-<lb/>
burg on Friday morning and<lb/>
crossed the Rhine that<lb/>
afternoon, stayed that<lb/>
night in Sundhausen and<lb/>
reached here last night<lb/>
making nearly sixty miles<lb/>
in the two days. Unfortunately<lb/>
Norris's shoes gave out at<lb/>
Freiburg and he had to<lb/>
wear new ones. His heels<lb/>
became blistered and last<lb/>
night they were beginning<lb/>
to fester. This made it<lb/>
necessary for him to lay<lb/>
off for a while so he will<lb/>
go by rail to Heidelburg<lb/>
and I will walk from<lb/>
here to there alone and<lb/>
and we will start from<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00157002"/>
there together on Thursday<lb/>
or Friday. I will go as<lb/>
for as Baden-Baden to-<lb/>
morrow, the next day to<lb/>
Carlsruhe and the next<lb/>
to Heidelburg. I stayed<lb/>
over here to-day (Sunday) to<lb/>
see the town which is<lb/>
an extremely interesting<lb/>
one. The roofs of the houses<lb/>
are steep and they have<lb/>
Dormer windows, sometimes<lb/>
three or four rows of them.<lb/>
The town is surrounded by<lb/>
high walls and fortifications<lb/>
and can only be entered by<lb/>
certain gates. You would<lb/>
think that a war was<lb/>
going on, and the enormous<lb/>
number of soldiers adds to<lb/>
this appearance. I went<lb/>
to the famous cathedral this<lb/>
morning and it is really<lb/>
a remarkably fine building.<lb/>
I heard <del>the</del> and saw the clock<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00157003"/>
&ldquo;go off&rdquo; at twelve o'clock. It is<lb/>
a remarkable mechanism<lb/>
but with its crowing cock<lb/>
and puppet figures, it seems<lb/>
rediculous in a fine<lb/>
church. I went up into<lb/>
the tower where there is a<lb/>
fine view of the city with<lb/>
the Vosges and Ural moun-<lb/>
tains and the Black Forest.<lb/>
Our walk from Freiburg<lb/>
has all been in beautiful<lb/>
country and we had good<lb/>
chance to study the life<lb/>
of the peasants. At Sundhausen<lb/>
where we slept Friday night<lb/>
we had a very pleasant<lb/>
evening. While we were eating<lb/>
dinner a German who was<lb/>
staying there came in and<lb/>
afterwards an Alsacian<lb/>
and a German soldier. We<lb/>
sat there and talked <del>from</del><lb/>
until eleven o'clock and<lb/>
had a jolly time besides<lb/>
getting good practice in<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00157004"/>
German. The German was a<lb/>
very intelligent man and<lb/>
knew some English. However<lb/>
we talked altogether in<lb/>
German and <del>at</del> only used<lb/>
his knowledge of English for<lb/>
the sake of comparing the<lb/>
two languages. A great<lb/>
many of the scenes in the<lb/>
country reminded me of<lb/>
Millet's paintings. The people<lb/>
do not live in scattered<lb/>
houses like our farm-houses<lb/>
but they are all gathered<lb/>
together in villages.<lb/>
We saw them gathering<lb/>
and beating hemp. And<lb/>
much to my surprize we<lb/>
<del>we</del> saw a great deal<lb/>
of tobacco and Indian corn<lb/>
growing. Of course the<lb/>
grape is the chief product.<lb/>
The Markgr&auml;fler wine is grown<lb/>
in Baden near Freiburg.<lb/>
The language here is very<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00157005"/>
peculiar. Most of the people speak both<lb/>
French and German while some speak<lb/>
only French and some only German.<lb/>
The signs on the street are in both<lb/>
languages. I think the real Germans<lb/>
on the other side of the river are a<lb/>
more intelligent race than these<lb/>
Alsacians.</p>
<p>I am now in excellent trim for<lb/>
walking. The first soreness and stiffness<lb/>
has worn of and I can go on walking<lb/>
until the muscles tire. My feet<lb/>
have not troubled me at all.</p>
<p>I feel lost without getting <unclear>any</unclear><lb/>
letters. I could have ordered them<lb/>
sent here but I was afraid I would<lb/>
not be allowed to come in without<lb/>
a passport. I find that it is only<lb/>
in entering Alsace from France that<lb/>
they are strict. The Germans are anxious<lb/>
to cut off intercourse between Alsace<lb/>
and France as much as possible<lb/>
in order to Germanize the province.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
