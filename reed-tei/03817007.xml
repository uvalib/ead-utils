MAYO CLINIC<lb/>
ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA<lb/>
Monday aft <date value="1941-06-09">6/9/41</date>
</dateline>
DR. PHILIP S. HENCH<lb/>
DR. CHARLES H. SLOCUMB<lb/>
<salute>Dear Frek,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Well I arrived home this morning from my second eastern<lb/>
jaunt within a week. Let me tell you a little about them.<lb/>
It was not originally planned to show Cornwell's paintings<lb/>
&ldquo;Conquerors of yellow Fever&rdquo; at the A.M.A. as it <unclear></unclear> wasn't<lb/>
finished. He says he has two more month's work to do on it<lb/>
altho it looks practically finished to a layman's eye. But about<lb/>
2 weeks before AMA they decided to use it (The Wyeth Co) as the<lb/>
center of their AMA exhibit. So they arranged a private pre-view<lb/>
&amp; dedication of it. My wired &amp; asked me to give the main address.<lb/>
&amp; paid my expenses there &amp; back. It was my year to stay home from<lb/> the AMA &amp; Chuck Slocumb's year to go so at first I didn't see<lb/>
how I could go. The clinic thought I could get away for 1 1/2<lb/>
days alright so I went. It was most fortunate for me because<lb/>
this I was able to attend the executive committee meeting<lb/>
of our American Rheumatism Association and also<lb/>
most of the scientific sessions of the ARA on the same Monday<lb/>
as the unveiling of the painting</p>
<p>I had a long cold with fever &amp; was in bed Thursday &amp;<lb/>
Friday before going to Cleveland. Indeed on Thursday<lb/>
night my voice was gone &amp; with my fever Dr <unclear>Mueler</unclear> said<lb/>
I couldn't go to Cleveland at all. But I inhaled<lb/>
steam vigorously &amp; felt well enough to go on Sat. aft.<lb/>
with Chuck Slucomb. We got to our hotel Sunday morning<lb/>
&amp; I got in touch with Mr. Kellogg who <unclear>arranged</unclear> this<lb/>
unveiling. We went over the plans &amp; then I had<lb/>
dinner &amp; a rest alone in my hotel bedroom.<lb/>
In the afternoon from 3 till 7 PM we had our<lb/>
executive meeting &amp; I gave the report of our <unclear>military</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03817008"/>
committee. Eighteen of us are offering our services to the Surgeon<lb/>
General as specialists to be used if necessary. These 18 were very<lb/>
carefully chosen. I am one of them. Of course we may never be called<lb/>
but Col <unclear>Hillman</unclear> of the Surgeon General's office was most anxious<lb/>
to have us ready &amp;<unclear>willing.</unclear></p>
<p>At 7 Mr Chuck &amp; I &amp; others were invited to Dr. <unclear>Stecher's</unclear> for<lb/>
buffet supper. He is one of my friends &amp; a member of our council. He<lb/>
seems to be quite wealthy &amp; has a beautiful home - an estate really-<lb/>
right on the lake. We enjoyed a grand dinner &amp; stayed till 11 P.M.<lb/>
Monday morning we had a most excellent session of our Rheumatism<lb/>
association - it was just splendid. Highly scientific &amp; most<lb/>
promising. How far our association has gone since we founded it<lb/>
a few years ago. As a founder I felt very proud. I had been<lb/>
allowed to invite from 5-10 guests of my own to the unveiling<lb/>
but it was so late that I only invited about 6 &amp; only 3 of them<lb/>
could come. Dr Frank Edmundsen (Sue's husband) &amp; Dr &amp;<lb/>
Mrs Walter Simpson of Dayton Ohio. We all met at 12 o'clock<lb/>
It was a small but very elite affair- About 45 guests<lb/>
including the Mayor of Cleveland, the President of the AMA<lb/>
(who sat next to me), the President elect of the AMA, Surgeon-<lb/>
General Ireland &amp; wife, Mr Kissinger, Walter Reed's daughter,<lb/>
<unclear>We</unclear> all sat at the head table with <unclear>Dr Mulholland</unclear> (Atch's<lb/>
friend from Charlottesville representing the U of Va). The guests<lb/>
included some physicians &amp; directors of art institutions etc.<lb/>
Unfortunately the Pres. &amp; Pres-elect of the AMA were trying to<lb/>
spread themselves very thin &amp; sneak around to as many<lb/>
luncheons etc as possible so they only stayed for the first 2<lb/>
courses as they had promised to drop in on another lunch<lb/>
somewhere. So we had to stop while the meal was in<lb/>
progress &amp; have the unveiling before my talk rather than<lb/>
last as planned. Mrs Reed who sat next to me<lb/>
pulled the ribbons &amp; unveiled it &amp; the photographers snapped<lb/>
her with the AMA Presidents &amp; then they (the men) left.<lb/>
We continued our meal &amp; then the mayor (a very nice man<lb/>
by the way) gave a nice little speech of welcome &amp; then<lb/>
Mr. Law the President of the Wyeth Co. introduced me<lb/>
most flatteringly. I then gave &ldquo;the address&rdquo; &amp; it was<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03817009"/>
MAYO CLINIC<lb/>
ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA<lb/>
DR. PHILIP S. HENCH<lb/>
DR. CHARLES H. SLOCUMB<lb/>
very obvious that it was very well received. I was most pleased &amp;<lb/>
later heard many nice things said of it. Dr Carey, Dean of<lb/>
Marquette University Med. School invited me right then &amp; there<lb/>
to come to Marquette to give it next fall. I understand (confidently)<lb/>
that it is to be printed &amp; a copy sent with each copy of the<lb/>
painting to over 100, 000 medical men. After I finished<lb/>
Kissinger spoke very briefly - 2 or 3 nice modest sentences.<lb/>
Then Gen. Ireland spoke only a minute or so &amp; that ended the<lb/>
affair. Photographs were then taken of those of us in the ceremony<lb/>
(see enclosed) &amp; then Mr. Cornwell (I forgot to say he gave a 10<lb/>
minute most interesting artistic analysis &amp; <unclear></unclear> of his<lb/>
painting. Why this &amp; that were done etc) asked Mr. Kissinger<lb/>
to pose for some sketches so that he could change Kissinger's<lb/>
features in the painting somewhat. That was Monday at 3 PM.<lb/>
While we were chatting Mr Kissinger told me he hadn't felt<lb/>
any too well and had recently had an &ldquo;affair&rdquo; which<lb/>
affected his face. As he told me this I wondered to myself<lb/>
if he could have had stroke which cleared up. Well<lb/>
while I was in Easton I got a wire that Mr. K had arrived<lb/>
home Wed, felt well &amp; happy, told Mrs. K all about the<lb/>
affair &amp; then suddenly had a severe stroke. Mrs K told me<lb/>
he was unconscious &amp; not expected to live! Isn't that<lb/>
sad. I have wired &amp; today I wrote her a letter, I've<lb/>
heard no more &amp; don't know whether he is recovering,<lb/>
<unclear>living</unclear> or dead. Incidentally he asked about my &ldquo;lovely<lb/>
mother.&rdquo; He is a nice old fellow, a gallant soldier &amp; a<lb/>
simple Christian gentleman &amp; I hope he can recover but if he's<lb/>
to be paralyzed I hope he goes now.</p>

<p><unclear></unclear><lb/>
<unclear></unclear></p>
<p>I got back to our Rheumatism meeting about 3 P M, it lasted till 5<lb/>
&amp; at 7<hi rend="sup">30</hi> we had a very nice banquet. One of our men had been<lb/>
in England 6 months in an operating unit &amp; gave us a fine<lb/>
talk on conditions in England. I left at midnight,<lb/>
got to <unclear>Winna</unclear> Tuesday noon where<unclear>Mary</unclear> met me.</p>
<p>I left for<unclear>Easton</unclear> Thursday on the 400, got to the <unclear>Easton</unclear><lb/>
hotel Friday about 7 PM. They had reserved for me the same<lb/>
room we had last year. It was nice to have it but it made<lb/>
me feel lonesome not to have Mary with me, you &amp; the kids<lb/>
in the next room &amp; Atch nearby, I ran into some <unclear></unclear> alumni<lb/>
almost at once - Chuck <unclear>Siebert</unclear>, Judge whats-his-name etc<lb/>
&amp; they spoke of facts so nicely etc. Then I went up on the hill to<lb/>
hear the <unclear>step</unclear> singing in front of <unclear>Pander</unclear>. Met several friends<lb/>
including Dr Berg (spelling?) the man who <unclear>cabed</unclear> me for my<lb/>
honorary degree in the ceremony last year. He was kind enough<lb/>
to say that they were very pleased &amp; proud to have given me the<lb/>
degree. I met Dr Hall, Dr <unclear>Gordon</unclear>, Foster &amp; a couple other<lb/>
old teachers - all asked of you &amp; <unclear>Atch</unclear>. &amp; Dr <unclear>Gordon<lb/>
</unclear> told an amusing story about father (too long to enclose).</p>
<p>At 9 I went to our <unclear><hi rend="sup">1</hi>16</unclear> headquarters, the plumbing<lb/>
establishment of my <unclear>Easton</unclear> classmate <unclear>Stipe</unclear>. They had<lb/>
all the beer &amp; pretzel and ginger ale any one could drink<lb/>
&amp; we just sat around &amp; laughed &amp; sang etc till 2 AM!<lb/>
There were almost 60 who dropped in &amp; out during the<lb/>
evening. Some I hadn't seen for 25 years! among them<lb/>
<unclear>Bing Gayvar</unclear> in whose home I stayed during the days<lb/>
I was &ldquo;expelled&rdquo; from the college - Atch will recall him-<lb/>
It was a swell <unclear></unclear> evening. Some of us got together<lb/>
&amp; we had some marvellous harmony on all the old<lb/>
songs. Atch may remember <unclear>Tom Brown</unclear> (baseball player)<lb/>
who lived in <unclear>Dowell</unclear> near us. Boy did we sing! My voice was gone by 2 AM!</p>
<p>The town parade started at 10<hi rend="superscript">30</hi> &amp; we had about 50<lb/>
in line. The weather was bright - a bit hot.</p>
<pb n="5" id="f03817011"/>
<p>The parade ended at the foot of the hill - a very good crowd of<lb/>
town folk watched it - more than I remember on the streets &amp; also<lb/>
in line. In the parade I ran into Tom Williams, my classmate<lb/>
&amp; fraternity brother whom I haven't seen for 25 years! After we all<lb/>
had our class photo taken at the foot of the hill Tom &amp; I<lb/>
went up &amp; wandered over the campus It was beautiful!<lb/>
We met an old prof - I can't recall his name - he said &ldquo;<lb/>
all the Henches were smart - a fine family - fine students<lb/>
all!&rdquo;. I was much pleased but wondered if he met<lb/>
George Hench &amp; Tom! I was taking a few colored movies<lb/>
near <unclear>Pavell</unclear> Hall when a woman came up &amp; said &ldquo;Do you<lb/>
<unclear></unclear> chance have an extra film in your camera?&rdquo; I said I did<lb/>
the same &ldquo;I realize I'm presumptious but my father &amp; 3 of his old<lb/>
classmates are here together. They made us arrangements to have<lb/>
a photo taken &amp; it may be their last get together. Could you<lb/>
take a little snapshot? &rdquo; I said &ldquo;surely&rdquo;. Then I asked the<lb/>
four nice old men what class they belonged to. They said<lb/>
188! So I told them my father was Hench '83 They just<lb/>
beamed. They all knew him &amp; one man said &ldquo;Why you're<lb/>
Philip Hench. I've known of you since you were a baby &amp; I<lb/>
knew your parents very very well.&rdquo; It was Mr. A. P.<lb/>
Bachman who is a lawyer in New York now (150 Nassau<lb/>
St. New York City). The others were J Frank Briggs<lb/>
Middletown, Delaware, <unclear>WO Sample</unclear> of Easton &amp; Edwards<lb/>
M Haymaker who works &amp; generally lives in Guatamala<lb/>
but whose home was in Warrensburg, Mo. Do you recall<lb/>
any of them aside from Mr. Bachman? Well we had a<lb/>
fine chat &amp; their ladies seemed so happy that I could<lb/>
take the photos. I hope they turn out alright.</p>
<p>at the alumni lunch I sat with my class.<lb/>
They had an exhibit a large painting of old <unclear>Frankie's</unclear><lb/>
March in his office surrounded by piles &amp; piles of<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f03817012"/>
books &amp; magazines. It was a swell painting made from an old<lb/>
photo. After the luncheon a photo was taken of all of the<lb/>
alumni who had had old <unclear>Frankie</unclear> as a teacher, with the<lb/>
painting behind them. They are planning to <unclear>raise</unclear> money for<lb/>
a <unclear>Frankie</unclear> Hall Memorial Bldg of some sort.</p>
<p>Then we paraded around the campus &amp; baseball field.<lb/>
I still got a thrill when we mass hands &amp; march down to<lb/>
onward Christian Soldiers. Lafayette won the game - a good<lb/>
&amp; exciting game but it was so hot &amp; my hay fever bothered<lb/>
me so I left at 5 for the hotel &amp; a bath. At 6<hi rend="superscript">30</hi> we<lb/>
had a class banquet after which <unclear>Archie</unclear> Wood &amp;<lb/>
<unclear>Creveling</unclear> &amp; I showed various movies of old reunions<lb/>
we'd taken. They wanted to see the one of me receiving<lb/>
my degree and many of my classmates were generous<lb/>
enough to congratulate me on it.</p>
<p>The banquet was over at 9 &amp; I left at 9 <hi rend="superscript">58</hi> via<lb/>
Buffalo, the Welland Canal, the Canadian shore of Lake<lb/>
Erie, Duluth &amp; Chicago. Got there last night &amp; home<lb/>
this morning after a <hi>swell trip</hi>. But I was a bit<lb/>
lonesome remembering that last year I had all my family<lb/>
with me.</p>
<p>I enclose various clippings, photos etc. Please return<lb/>
them soon. Now at last I expect to be here awhile<lb/>
I certainly have <unclear>counted</unclear> east these last weeks &amp;<lb/>
been away more than I've been here. <unclear>And</unclear> heavy season<lb/>
is on &amp; we have hundreds of patients!</p>
<closer>
<salute>Love to all.</salute>
<signed>Philip</signed>
Bill <unclear>Comrod</unclear> wasn't<lb/>
there. a number of profs asked for<lb/>
you (mother) &amp; Atch. Many of my classmates also<lb/>
asked about Atch most kindly &amp; applauded<lb/>
him when he appeared in my movie.<lb/>
