Transcript.</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>&ldquo;WALTER REED AND YELLOW<lb/>
FEVER.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All readers interested in detective<lb/>
stories, of the identification, arrest,<lb/>
trial, sentence and execution of<lb/>
heinous criminals, miscreated, dia-<lb/>
bolic and hell-born in the very grain,<lb/>
will find a rare treat in the recently<lb/>
published biography of Dr. Walter<lb/>
Reed, surgeon and ranking major in<lb/>
the United States army. At the same<lb/>
time they will feel their moral enthu-<lb/>
siasm and zest in hero worship raised<lb/>
to the highest pitch--a happy result<lb/>
not always experienced through over-<lb/>
addiction to the reading of detective<lb/>
stories, where too often the detective<lb/>
himself strikes one as not a whit the<lb/>
superior in the practice of the cardi-<lb/>
nal virtues to the malefactor he hunts<lb/>
down.</p>
<p>The criminal in this now world-<lb/>
famous case was no less and no greater<lb/>
a personage than the familiarly-<lb/>
known mosquito. This seems a pretty<lb/>
small class for a scentifically-edu-<lb/>
cated United States officer to pit his<lb/>
intellect against. Here was no Jona-<lb/>
than Wild or Captain Kidd or even<lb/>
Dick Turpin to test one's mettle of<lb/>
valor. But, alas! as great Edmund<lb/>
Burke said 200 years ago, &ldquo;The age<lb/>
of chivalry is gone; that of sophis-<lb/>
ters, economists and calculators has<lb/>
succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lower yet even than to Burke's<lb/>
sophisters, economists and calcula-<lb/>
tors, in the room of the Chevalier<lb/>
Bayards and Sir Philip Sidneys of<lb/>
yore have we of today fallen--into the<lb/>
realm, indeed, of the gnats, pismires<lb/>
and mosquitos--nay, below the &ldquo;low-<lb/>
est deep a lower deep still threat-<lb/>
ening to devour us opens wide.&rdquo; It is<lb/>
into the realm of the most insignifi-<lb/>
cant and invisible microbes and bac-<lb/>
teria.</p>
<p>Here, then, is to be sought the<lb/>
veritable haunts of the primeval<lb/>
dragons, belching forth smoke and<lb/>
pestilence over whole lands, which<lb/>
the St. Georges of old rode out, spear<lb/>
in hand, to slay and deliver the trem-<lb/>
bling peoples from--yes, here crouch<lb/>
the dragons, invincible as the &ldquo;arrow<lb/>
that flieth by day and the pestilence<lb/>
that walketh in darkness,&rdquo; which the<lb/>
chivalrous knight of today, &ldquo;without<lb/>
fear and without reproach,&rdquo; is sum-<lb/>
moned to prick forth to meet.</p>
<p>Alas! small game to hunt, these<lb/>
mosquito and pismire dragons! is the<lb/>
first impression on the imagination--<lb/>
more contemptible even, in the way<lb/>
of sport, than hunting guinea pigs in-<lb/>
stead of wild boars and tigers.</p>
<p>Turn, however, to the pages of his-<lb/>
tory and read the most authentic and<lb/>
carefully tabulated statistics that<lb/>
have come down to posterity of the<lb/>
havoc wrought by the fellest, scaly<lb/>
and pestilence-breathing dragon St.<lb/>
George ever slew! It will be found<lb/>
that the dragon could never hold a<lb/>
candle to the mosquito.</p>
<p>True, the dragons were many of<lb/>
them winged creatures, and so, seem-<lb/>
ingly, participating in an aerial na-<lb/>
ture. But, like all the winged sau-<lb/>
rians, they were awkward and cum-<lb/>
bersome flyers. Besides, their powers<lb/>
of reproduction were of the most par-<lb/>
simoniously stingy order--three or<lb/>
four dragons, perhaps, to the litter.<lb/>
How, then, would the mosquito,<lb/>
blithely singing as he flies, and in the<lb/>
most nonchalant and touch-and-go<lb/>
way depositing on the scum of every<lb/>
stagnant pool the embryos of half a<lb/>
million lineal heirs, smile in his<lb/>
sleeve at such a lumbering and race-<lb/>
suiciding monster. After which, and<lb/>
as though all this were a mere baga-<lb/>
telle, how would he again rise blithely<lb/>
on the air, derisively singing, &ldquo;He that<lb/>
despiseth little things shall perish lit-<lb/>
tle by little!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one can thoughtfully read this<lb/>
book, &ldquo;Walter Reed and Yellow<lb/>
Fever,&rdquo; without feeling that a pro-<lb/>
found and fairly revolutionary effect<lb/>
has been wrought on his imagination.<lb/>
The story is most succintly and lu-<lb/>
minously told by Dr. Howard A. Kelly,<lb/>
surgical professor in Johns Hopkins<lb/>
University, who has done his work<lb/>
in a manner at once thoroughly scien-<lb/>
tific and thoroughly artistic. Dr.<lb/>
Kelly knows how to mass his forces.<lb/>
Under his skilful hands the despised<lb/>
mosquito rises to the giant propor-<lb/>
tions of a Goliath of Gath, with a<lb/>
spear like a weaver's beam, which<lb/>
the heroic stripling David, under the<lb/>
alias of Walter Reed, who planked a<lb/>
stone deep into his forehead, rises<lb/>
a thousandfold more strongly en-<lb/>
trenched in our heroic admiration<lb/>
than even on the occasion of that<lb/>
first historical encounter in which he<lb/>
delivered his people from the terror<lb/>
of the giant Philistine.</p>
<p>In truth, to get a truly adequate<lb/>
impression of the effect wrought by<lb/>
this book on the imagination of the<lb/>
reader, one must vividly recall to<lb/>
mind the scene in the Arabian Nights,<lb/>
where the fisherman uncorks the bot-<lb/>
tle which had been cast ashore. The<lb/>
fisherman no doubt welcomed it as<lb/>
a bottle of spirit, gin, rum or brandy.<lb/>
A bottle of spirit it veritably was, but<lb/>
of a kind of spirit, or genius, which<lb/>
King Solomon had condensed into it<lb/>
and sealed up ages before.</p>
<p>The cork no sooner extracted, but<lb/>
out began to stream the liberated<lb/>
genius, a terror and portent darken-<lb/>
ing the sky like a black thunder cloud<lb/>
and terrifying the cowering inhabi-<lb/>
tants beneath. Such the reappear-<lb/>
ance, on the lurid sky of the imagi-<lb/>
nation, of the mosquito since Dr.<lb/>
Walter Reed and his scientific con-<lb/>
querors have uncorked the mere vial<lb/>
of restricted intellectual apprehension<lb/>
in which he had previously been con-<lb/>
fined by an unscientific public.</p>
<p>From beginning to end the whole<lb/>
story of the combat instituted between<lb/>
the yellow fever Goliath mosquito and<lb/>
the valiant little David, Walter Reed<unclear>,</unclear><lb/>
is one magnificent piece of intelli-<lb/>
gence, heroism and humanity. It<lb/>
seems to usher in a new &ldquo;age of the<lb/>
martyrs&rdquo; ready to die for the faith;<lb/>
of fresh Latimers and Ridleys. The<lb/>
man who shows himself willing and<lb/>
glad to load up his suspected enemy,<lb/>
the mosquito, with all the yellow<lb/>
fever germs he can hold and then let<lb/>
him bite him, so as to make him turn<lb/>
states evidence against himself, re-<lb/>
veals the modern type of hero, mar-<lb/>
tyr or saint. But for soul-stirring<lb/>
details of this everybody must be<lb/>
sure to read the book itself!</p>
