<salute>My own little lovely wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your<lb/>
&ldquo;feetuing etsig,&rdquo; dated Harrison-<lb/>
burg; July 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, &amp; mailed on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, reached<lb/>
Apache, yesterday afternoon, the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>,<lb/>
old mantee was mighty glad to<lb/>
hear that you had gotten out of<lb/>
Washington, &ldquo;right side up with<lb/>
care&rdquo;, and reached H'burg safely-<lb/>
But poor little darling wifie,<lb/>
mantee is so sorry that she didn't<lb/>
have any money left in her little<lb/>
darling pocket! Love her heart!<lb/>
mantee should have given his<lb/>
little darling more money, for<lb/>
suppose she should have spent<lb/>
all her money in W. &amp; had<lb/>
none to take her to the Valley!<lb/>
wouldn't it have been dreadful,<lb/>
my lovie? I &ldquo;pec&rdquo;, however, that<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01749002"/>
my sweet little wifie knew<lb/>
what she was doing &amp; gauged<lb/>
her money so that she could get<lb/>
all the enjoyment out of it<lb/>
that was possible &amp; have just<lb/>
enough to pay her car-fare to<lb/>
Grandma Reeds! Bless your<lb/>
sweet, affectionate heart, that<lb/>
was exactly right, my darling<lb/>
wife, &amp; just what mantee wanted<lb/>
&amp; told you to do. He is so happy<lb/>
to think that your few dollars<lb/>
afforded you so much enjoy-<lb/>
-ment, and thinks you did very<lb/>
well to make it last till July<lb/>
1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. Of course, your actual<lb/>
expenses will be very little<lb/>
in H'burg, as there is nothing<lb/>
very particular to see. You pay<lb/>
your Nurse <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>4.00 a month &amp; I guess<lb/>
your washing &amp; Laurie's will cost<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>5.00 a month. Mantee has <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>75.00<lb/>
now, ready &amp; waiting to be sent<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01749003"/>
to his precious wifie, if the Pay-<lb/>
-master would only come along.<lb/>
I don't know when he will be<lb/>
here, &amp; as Col. Compton will<lb/>
leave here to-morrow or wednes-<lb/>
day, on his way to Santa Fe, I<lb/>
have a great notion to give<lb/>
him the money &amp; let him draw<lb/>
a check in Santa Fe &amp; forward<lb/>
to you. I could also have an<lb/>
excellent opportunity to send the<lb/>
money to pay for your necklace,<lb/>
if it was done - but I have<lb/>
not yet received the bill from<lb/>
Mr Lucas. I have got the money<lb/>
ready to pay for it - besides the <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>75.<lb/>
to send to you, lovie, and enough to<lb/>
pay all my July expenses. Now I<lb/>
&ldquo;fink&rdquo; that is doing &ldquo;wight&rdquo; well,<lb/>
to be able to cancel all the ex-<lb/>
penses of our journey; to pay<lb/>
my own expenses for half of May<lb/>
all of June &amp; July <add>expenses</add> &amp; to send my wifie<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01749004"/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>75.00 &amp; pay <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>75.00 for her necklace.<lb/>
And all of this out of our June &amp; July<lb/>
pay! Of course, I shouldn't have<lb/>
been able to have done so, had I<lb/>
not sold my rifle &amp; shot-gun &amp;<lb/>
our chairs, which together brought<lb/>
me <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>56.00, which added to our June &amp;<lb/>
July pay made <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>322.00, from which<lb/>
I had to draw, &amp; it has just taken<lb/>
it all. So that we begin August,<lb/>
lovie, out of debt &amp; <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>75.00 on its way<lb/>
to you<del>r</del> to help pay your expenses<lb/>
till mantee comes - Seven months<lb/>
pay, or <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>933.00, has done very well,<lb/>
I think, to pay our expenses, &amp; enable<lb/>
you to go east &amp; enjoy yourself.<lb/>
we have still five months pay<lb/>
or <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>666.00 left, &amp; I think, lovie, with<lb/>
care, this will defray our expenses<lb/>
for the remainder of the year &amp; ena-<lb/>
ble us to save something to buy<lb/>
our carpets, chairs &amp; c- Don't my<lb/>
little darling think so? I will let<lb/>
you know at the end of my letter whether<lb/>
I send the money by Col. Compton or not,<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01749005"/>
Page 5- So you called on Doctor<lb/>
Otis, my little wifie? you are right<lb/>
in saying that he appears <hi>dull</hi> &amp;<lb/>
queer- He is truly unattractive,<lb/>
but he is, for all that, darling, an<lb/>
exceeding<add>ly</add> intelligent man:<del><unclear></unclear></del><add>a</add> most<lb/>
excellent writer, &amp; a very hard<lb/>
student. Mrs. Harrison says he<lb/>
used to be quite a different<lb/>
looking man, but he has <add>had</add> great<lb/>
family afflictions, &amp; is himself<lb/>
suffering now from a mortal<lb/>
malady of the spine. Of course,<lb/>
he could tell you nothing in<lb/>
the world about the changes,<lb/>
for he hasn't a thing to do with<lb/>
it, any more than I have, but<lb/>
it was very good &amp; sweet in<lb/>
my little darling to go to him &amp;<lb/>
try to find out. If you had only<lb/>
gone to the Surgeon General,<lb/>
you <hi>might</hi> have learned something,<lb/>
but it is doubtful whether<lb/>
you could have got any in-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01749006"/>
-formation, even there. They are<lb/>
very queer at Headquarters &amp;<lb/>
very chary about telling any-<lb/>
-thing. But I presume it is so<lb/>
because officer's wi<del>f</del><add>v</add>es would<lb/>
be continually running &amp; beg-<lb/>
-ging for this &amp; that change, if it<lb/>
were possible to obtain it-<lb/>
And you were so delighted<lb/>
with Washington, that you<lb/>
would like to be stationed there.<lb/>
Well, precious, as for <hi>me</hi>, it<lb/>
is just <hi>the last</hi> place, I should<lb/>
care to be stationed at- Why,<lb/>
my little wifie, our salary wouldn't<lb/>
support us in W.- What<lb/>
<hi>will</hi> my pretty Emilie say<lb/>
when she gets old mantee's<lb/>
letter asking her how she<lb/>
would like Fort Union? I guess<lb/>
she will just run around<lb/>
the room &amp; tear her hair at<lb/>
the very <hi>thought</hi> of it! I &ldquo;pec&rdquo;<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01749007"/>
my little lovie likes the East<lb/>
better than the west - and for<lb/>
her darling sake, I do hope<lb/>
that we will get some pleas-<lb/>
-ant Eastern Post, where my<lb/>
precious Emilie can have an<lb/>
opportunity of seeing interes-<lb/>
-ting sights &amp; a chanc<del>h</del>e to pur-<lb/>
sue her art-studies. I am<lb/>
so happy, darling, that you<lb/>
got the books &amp; materials, &amp;<lb/>
I so much wish my little<lb/>
lovie would devote herself<lb/>
to improving her talents for<lb/>
painting- <hi>Nothing</hi> would<lb/>
please your poor old Man-<lb/>
-tee more. He would afford<lb/>
you every facility that his<lb/>
means would permit, &amp; do<lb/>
it, Emilie, darling, so gladly!<lb/>
I trust you will have a<lb/>
real pleasant time in the<lb/>
valley with Sister Annie<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01749008"/>
and Ma Reed, &amp; that you<lb/>
will grow fat &amp; kick &amp; be<lb/>
a sweet, plump arm-<hi>full</hi><lb/>
for mantee when he comes.<lb/>
You must get some good books<lb/>
&amp; read them, &amp; then write a heap<lb/>
of long letters to old mantee.<lb/>
Hereafter, I will put more stamps<lb/>
on my letters, lovie, so that you<lb/>
will not be bothered. I don't<lb/>
see how my letter to ma could<lb/>
have been <hi>mailed</hi> the 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>, unless<lb/>
You mean, &ldquo;post marked 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi><lb/>
at St. Joseph- I have sent you<lb/>
letters, my darling, since June<lb/>
began, on the following dates:<lb/>
June 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>, 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>;<lb/>
July 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, July 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- See<lb/>
if you have not got them<lb/>
all lovie. I should hate<lb/>
for any of my letters to<lb/>
miscarry, for I can only send<lb/>
them but once a week.<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01749009"/>
<hi>Page</hi> 9. <hi>Tuesday</hi>, <hi>July</hi> <hi>22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>79</hi>. I find, my<lb/>
darling wife, that it is uncertain<lb/>
just when Col. Compton will<lb/>
leave Apache, as it seems likely<lb/>
that he will have to remain<lb/>
till the New Commanding Officer,<lb/>
Major Cochran, 12 Infantry, arrives.<lb/>
On this account, I have thought<lb/>
it best to find some other &amp; quick-<lb/>
er way of getting some money<lb/>
to you, as I am afraid my<lb/>
little darling will be put to<lb/>
trouble by the want of it.<lb/>
It fortunately happens that Mrs.<lb/>
Harrison has a check on<lb/>
Treasury, in Washington, for<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>60.00 &amp; this I have got from<lb/>
her, &amp; made it payable to your<lb/>
order- The other <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>15.00, to make<lb/>
up the <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>75.00, I will send by the<lb/>
Paymaster when he comes, as<lb/>
I am determined that my pretty<lb/>
picture shall have every cent<lb/>
of her <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>75.00. Yes, she &ldquo;sal&rdquo; have it!<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01749010"/>
When you get this check, get<lb/>
Ma to go down to the bank with<lb/>
you &amp; get the money, &amp; then<lb/>
the first thing you do, buy a<lb/>
pound of real nice candy<lb/>
&amp; fill your &ldquo;tummick&rdquo; with it,<lb/>
but don't get the &ldquo;pelly&rdquo;-ache,<lb/>
my little lovie. Take mighty<lb/>
good care of your precious<lb/>
health and our sweet little<lb/>
darling's, and don't let any ac-<lb/>
-cident befall either of your<lb/>
precious selves. You know<lb/>
old mantee hasn't got any other<lb/>
little darlings in this world,<lb/>
and if anything should happen<lb/>
to his lovie's or Laurie's welfare,<lb/>
he don't know what he would<lb/>
do. They are the one bright spot<lb/>
in his life that he can look<lb/>
back to with pride &amp; pleasure,<lb/>
&amp; to which he looks forward<lb/>
<del>to</del> with so much hope, love.<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01749011"/>
<hi>Page 13</hi>- Last evening, lovie,<lb/>
we were all invited down to<lb/>
the Post Trader's to an enter-<lb/>
tainment given to Col. &amp; Mrs. C.<lb/>
on the eve of their departure.<lb/>
We all assembled in the new<lb/>
billiard room &amp; had a very en-<lb/>
-joyable time. Even Captain<lb/>
Adam K, &amp; Captain Jack Viven,<lb/>
&amp; Cap't. Mc Gowan were there.<lb/>
We had music, some dancing,<lb/>
and plenty of good salad with<lb/>
mayonnaise dressing, &amp; just enough<lb/>
Champagne to drive away in-<lb/>
-digestion. The three ladies were<lb/>
dressed in their best &amp; all looked<lb/>
very well. We stayed till mid-<lb/>
-night &amp; came home through<lb/>
a nice shower of rain - I es-<lb/>
-corted &ldquo;Jen&rdquo;. By the way, Captain<lb/>
Adam seems to have abandoned<lb/>
his last hope. He heeds no<lb/>
more the soothing ditty, &ldquo;there's<lb/>
a light in the window for thee,<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01749012"/>
Adam&rdquo;- There is no &ldquo;eye to mark<lb/>
his coming &amp; grow brighter when<lb/>
he comes&rdquo;; because he <hi>doesn't</hi><lb/>
go! Has not been to Captain<lb/>
Hentig's for a month, and seems<lb/>
to give himself &ldquo;no thought for the<lb/>
morrow&rdquo;, so to speak- Captain<lb/>
Alexander Bartholomew McGowan,<lb/>
for such is the abbreviated name<lb/>
of the new addition<del>s</del>, calls suf-<lb/>
-ficiently often and we tease<lb/>
Mrs. Harrison a good deal about<lb/>
him - at least Mrs. C. &amp; I do- all<lb/>
of which she bears in a very<lb/>
jolly manner. I think, however,<lb/>
that &ldquo;Barty&rdquo;, as we call him &ldquo;for<lb/>
short,&rdquo; doesn't stand much of<lb/>
a chance, because he has the<lb/>
habit, when a little excited,<lb/>
of just Knocking the &ldquo;King's Eng-<lb/>
-lish&rdquo; into a &ldquo;cocked hat,&rdquo; and this<lb/>
Mrs. H. doesn't relish one bit.<lb/>
So perhaps after all, the maiden,<lb/>
<pb n="13" id="f01749013"/>
with the bright, black eye, will<lb/>
leave Arizona with a &ldquo;heart so<lb/>
free&rdquo;! Did I tell you about my<lb/>
nice little cat &amp; beautiful pup-<lb/>
-py that I have? Well, my little<lb/>
wifie, after little Undie died, the<lb/>
house seemed so lonely that I had<lb/>
to have something about to keep<lb/>
me company- So I &amp; the Secretary<lb/>
to his Holiness, looked around &amp; finally<lb/>
succeeded in getting a splendid,<lb/>
puppy - a real big fellow, half<lb/>
setter &amp; half Newfoundland - and<lb/>
then &ldquo;Mrs. Mahoney, dear,&rdquo; presen-<lb/>
ted me with a half grown<lb/>
cat - and I considered myself<lb/>
happy once more. But bless<lb/>
your soul, my pretty wifie, they<lb/>
have driven me nearly crazy-<lb/>
I tried them for three night's<lb/>
in the house, &amp; such a racket<lb/>
never was heard in this world.<lb/>
I couldn't sleep a wink- I ex-<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f01749014"/>
-cluded the pup from the house<lb/>
at night &amp; let the cat stay in-<lb/>
Result- The pup howled &amp; scratched<lb/>
all night at the back<del>ed</del> door, &amp;<lb/>
the cat tried her best to get out,<lb/>
Consequently I excluded her the<lb/>
next night, but as she was a fe-<lb/>
male cat &amp; Tom Hentig is <hi>not</hi><lb/>
a female cat, they gave me such<lb/>
a concert as nearly drove me<lb/>
wild - Result - cat sent back<lb/>
next morning with many regrets<lb/>
to &ldquo;Mrs. Mahoney, dear&rdquo;, &amp; the dog kept<lb/>
in the out-house at night. Thus<lb/>
I managed at last, to get some<lb/>
sleep. The pup is very playful<lb/>
&amp; much company too, but as he has<lb/>
a few puppy failings, he is mostly<lb/>
excluded from the &ldquo;boudoir&rdquo;- But<lb/>
I must stop, lovie- Bear this in mind,<lb/>
darling, &amp; obey strictly. <hi>As soon as<lb/>
you get this letter</hi>, <hi>write at once &amp;<lb/>
acknowledge receipt of check</hi>- <hi>Don't<lb/>
forget this</hi>! Best love to all-<lb/>
A thousand sweet kisses for mother<lb/>
&amp; son - &amp; a heap of love- Write<lb/>
very often to your own loved &amp; devoted<lb/>
husband,</p>
<closer>
