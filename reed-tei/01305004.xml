<salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just received, by special deliver, the enclosed sketch (&ldquo;R.W.R.&rdquo;)<lb/>
of my Father, the late Assistant Surgeon General Henry Rose Carter,<lb/>
which I thought had been sent you last fall! After having <add>at that time</add> made va-<lb/>
rious pencilled corrections and omissions in the sketch, as re-<lb/>
quested by your representative, who gave it to me personally, I sent<lb/>
the sketch to Baltimore to a friend of my Father's, whose opinion I<lb/>
value most highly, asking that he go over the sketch and my changes<lb/>
therein and, if he had no further suggestions to make, that he mail<lb/>
the sketch to you by registered mail at <hi>once</hi>. I was very anxious<lb/>
for you to have this corrected sketch as, while deeply appreciating<lb/>
the sympathetic and appreciative manner in which it is written there<lb/>
were several statements which needed correction: among others, <add>(1)</add> Father<lb/>
was nominated for the Nobel Prize, but did not receive it: (2) Father's<lb/>
work on &ldquo;extrinsic incubation&rdquo; (&ldquo;A Note on the Interval between In-<lb/>
fecting and Secondary Cases of Yellow Fever&rdquo; etc (1900) was <hi>one</hi> of<lb/>
the several observations which determined the direction of the work of<lb/>
<del><unclear></unclear></del> Reed and his co-workers. Sir Ronald Ross' work on malaria and that<lb/>
of Carlos Finlay of Cuba were also cited by Reed as contributary to<lb/>
the findings of the Reed Board. I mentioned to your representative last<lb/>
fall that both of these changes were important, as Father, as well as I,<lb/>
would have deplored an over-statment of that <add>credit</add> to which he is entitled.<lb/>
Of course, I thought the enclosed MS had been sent you long since and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01305005"/>
and<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
can only hope that it will, even yet, reach you in its corrected form<lb/>
before your Cyclopedia of American Biography goes to press.</p>
<p>With best wishes for your success, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
