<salute>My darling Sister:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your very<lb/>
kind letters must not be<lb/>
permitted to remain un=<lb/>
answered any longer, if I<lb/>
<hi>am</hi> one of the poorest cor=<lb/>
respondents in the world. It<lb/>
was real kind in you to<lb/>
grasp the goose-quill and<lb/>
indite a second letter to your<lb/>
negligent brother. It only<lb/>
goes to show what a real,<lb/>
live woman, &amp; the Mother of<lb/>
some eight, ten or twelve<lb/>
children (I forget the exact<lb/>
figures,) can do when she<lb/>
once gets up the proper<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f13911002"/>
momentum! Bless you, my<lb/>
Sister! that even, in your<lb/>
old age, you have lost<lb/>
nothing of the elasticity of your<lb/>
pen or the vigor of your<lb/>
mind! of course, the words<lb/>
&ldquo;old age&rdquo; were meant only<lb/>
<del>for</del> <add>as</add> &ldquo;a figure of speech&rdquo;, as<lb/>
&ldquo;Father Tom&rdquo; would say. I<lb/>
wonder if your fleshy hus=<lb/>
band recalls the morning when<lb/>
at Blacks &amp; Blues (I mean<lb/>
<hi>whites</hi>,) he read &ldquo;Father Tom<lb/>
&amp; the Pope&rdquo; &amp; shook with<lb/>
much glee his rotund ab=<lb/>
domen! This is <hi>not</hi> &ldquo;a figure<lb/>
of speech&rdquo;! &ldquo;Indade&rdquo; it's down-<lb/>
right poetry (&ldquo;I should say <hi>truth</hi>&rdquo;)<lb/>
Bedad! I don't know what's<lb/>
got into this crotchety old<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f13911003"/>
pen that it should write<lb/>
<hi>one</hi> thing when I mean <hi>an=<lb/>
other</hi>! &ldquo;Howsomediver&rdquo;, <hi>every-<lb/>
thing</hi> is either <hi>one</hi> thing or <hi>another</hi><lb/>
thing; you won't be &ldquo;after&rdquo; try-<lb/>
ing to contravene that prop=<lb/>
osition, will you? Well, as I<lb/>
was just going to say, if any=<lb/>
thing be one thing, it's well<lb/>
&amp; good, &amp; no harm's done;<lb/>
<hi>but</hi>, if it be <hi>another</hi> thing,<lb/>
then its plain it isn't <hi>both</hi><lb/>
things, &amp; so can't be <hi>two</hi> things,<lb/>
now what <hi>can't</hi> be <hi>two</hi> things<lb/>
must be one thing, &amp; <hi>therefore</hi><lb/>
whether its <hi>one</hi> thing or <hi>another</hi><lb/>
its all the same, &amp; hence, as<lb/>
I was about to remark<lb/>
when I wandered off into<lb/>
this little labyry<add>n</add>th, I don't<lb/>
know but what the pen is<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f13911004"/>
<hi>right</hi> after all! &amp; if it <hi>is</hi> why<lb/>
then all poetry is truth, &amp;<lb/>
&ldquo;vice versa&rdquo; (which is the clas=<lb/>
sical for &ldquo;shoe on the other<lb/>
genieu's foot&rdquo;) all truth is<lb/>
poetry! which to say the least<lb/>
is a &ldquo;poser&rdquo;! how; if your<lb/>
oldest daughter or son, (for bedad, its all one to me,) wants<lb/>
to try his hand at parsing,<lb/>
just for edification's sake, let<lb/>
him <del>trying</del> tackle, as we say west,<lb/>
the foregoing elongated sen-<lb/>
tence &amp; then see if his <add>or her</add> hair<lb/>
don't stand on his or her<lb/>
head perpendicularly to the<lb/>
surface thereof, &amp; if it don't,<lb/>
why then my powers of<lb/>
prognostication are no better<lb/>
than old Wiggins! I have spoken!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f13911005"/>
&ldquo;whoop la&rdquo;! Do you follow<lb/>
me? This is only a <hi>sample</hi>;<lb/>
my dear sister! Do you<lb/>
like it? If so, here goes!<lb/>
I may as well mention that<lb/>
it is known as the &ldquo;style<lb/>
Enigmatical&rdquo;, which is latin<lb/>
for &ldquo;non come atibus in<lb/>
swampo up stumpo&rdquo;! Aha!<lb/>
if its for a &ldquo;taste of the clas=<lb/>
sical&rdquo;, why I am right<lb/>
with you! For instance, &ldquo;om-<lb/>
nia gallia in tres partes divisa<lb/>
Est&rdquo;! oh! yes it is! I know<lb/>
that <hi>some</hi> people, of more im=<lb/>
agination than sound learning,<lb/>
say that its divided into <hi>four</hi><lb/>
parts, but believe me, I've<lb/>
been there &amp; I ought to know!<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f13911006"/>
call up your oldest boy,<lb/>
<del>called</del> <add>sirnamed</add> Lemuel, &amp; if he doesn't<lb/>
sustain my statement, why<lb/>
I'll &ldquo;skip the ditch&rdquo;! However,<lb/>
I remember that the S.E, or<lb/>
style Enigmat, is more suited<lb/>
for diplomats than for friendly<lb/>
correspondents, &amp; hence I'll drop<lb/>
it like a cold potatoe! Now<lb/>
lest you may infer, my dear<lb/>
Sister, that your little brother<lb/>
is clean daft, I will only<lb/>
say that this little frolic=<lb/>
someness of feelings &amp; exu=<lb/>
berance of animal spirits are<lb/>
due to the fact that the sun,<lb/>
which has for two weeks<lb/>
hidden his face &amp; warmth,<lb/>
has just a moment ago<lb/>
burst upon Fort Omaha<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f13911007"/>
in all his meridian splen=<lb/>
dor &amp; has warmed the very<lb/>
cockles of my heart to such<lb/>
an extent that I couldn't<lb/>
help it, if I had wanted to.<lb/>
It was merely the gyrations<lb/>
of the uncaged steed, as it were.<lb/>
Well, certainly, you want to<lb/>
know how I &amp; the family are,<lb/>
how we are settled, how<lb/>
we like it, &amp;c,- (I would put<lb/>
several of these &amp;c, thusly, &amp;c, &amp;c,<lb/>
&amp;c, &amp;c, but I saw only the other<lb/>
day that <hi>one</hi> of the &amp;c meant<lb/>
just as much as forty of the &amp;c,<lb/>
&amp; if that is really the case, why<lb/>
its really a saving of both<lb/>
time &amp; ink by making only one<lb/>
&amp;c, &amp; that's the reason I didn't<lb/>
make quite a number of them.)<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f13911008"/>
Well, as I was just about to<lb/>
say, before I relieved myself<lb/>
of that last &ldquo;chunk of learning&rdquo;,<lb/>
we are all <hi>well</hi>, at present,<lb/>
&amp; if our appetites are any in=<lb/>
dication, I might say, &ldquo;hearty&rdquo;-<lb/>
&ldquo;Emerline&rdquo;, the lady who presides<lb/>
over the teapot with additional<lb/>
grace, each day, has not been<lb/>
so &ldquo;well&rdquo;, all the time, &ldquo;forby&rdquo; a<lb/>
fall which she had last summer,<lb/>
but thank heaven she has stuck<lb/>
to the &ldquo;hearty&rdquo; right straight through<lb/>
&amp;she shows no indication of<lb/>
letting go her grip, whether<lb/>
any body &ldquo;dark the hole&rdquo; or not!<lb/>
Lawrence, the hope of the &ldquo;casa&rdquo; (<hi>span-<lb/>
ish</hi>, my dear - call up Lemuel again)<lb/>
&amp; who is said to resemble his father<lb/>
in playfulness, if naught else,<lb/>
grows daily more interesting.<lb/>
I will say, if I <hi>am</hi> his father,<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f13911009"/>
that he is as fine a sample<lb/>
of a five year old kid, as<lb/>
I ever saw! &amp; you don't for=<lb/>
get that <add>I</add> <del>f</del> have seen <hi>your</hi><lb/>
boys! Ho! Ho! you tickle me,<lb/>
&amp; I'll return the complement!<lb/>
He has a good solid brain<lb/>
&amp; is vivacious withal. I must<lb/>
narrate a remark<del>s</del> he made,<lb/>
yesterday morning, at the break=<lb/>
fast table. His mother, some<lb/>
time ago, bought a small jug,<lb/>
of a fancy pattern, which not=<lb/>
withstanding the fact that it is<lb/>
used for milk, is none the less<lb/>
a jug. So yesterday morning,<lb/>
when he desired a draft of<lb/>
milk, he called out to the &ldquo;wild<lb/>
Susan&rdquo;, &ldquo;I say, waiter, pass<lb/>
the jug&rdquo;! which I really thought<lb/>
was not bad, at all- The com=<lb/>
bination of &ldquo;waiter&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;jug&rdquo;, for<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f13911010"/>
a five year old, I considered<lb/>
very good. The state of my<lb/>
own solubility, I may say, is<lb/>
good, as you may infer- Con=<lb/>
cerning our household comforts<lb/>
I may add that they are to<lb/>
our liking &amp; satisfaction &amp; that<lb/>
we are quite satisfied with<lb/>
our station &amp; the people are<lb/>
very pleasant- We are only<lb/>
4 miles from the city of Omaha,<lb/>
&amp; are not in an uncivilized<lb/>
country, &amp; surrounded by Indians,<lb/>
as when in Arizona. We have<lb/>
been through the coldest winter<lb/>
I have ever experienced, but<lb/>
we have, nevertheless, kept<lb/>
quite comfortable. Our<lb/>
most valued blessing is<lb/>
in the shape of our good<lb/>
cook which we had in<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f13911011"/>
Washington- She will re=<lb/>
main the rest of this year<lb/>
at least, &amp; I hope longer,<lb/>
as she takes all care from<lb/>
Emily on the score of provid=<lb/>
ing the delicacies of the season,<lb/>
so to speak. We have at our<lb/>
Post nearly 400 men &amp; 24 off=<lb/>
icers, nearly as many ladies,<lb/>
a good band of music &amp;<lb/>
any quantity of children!<lb/>
I occasionally hear from Tom<lb/>
&amp; Kit- Hope to visit them<lb/>
sometime during the year.<lb/>
<unclear>Annie</unclear> writes me that Pa<lb/>
has quite recovered &amp; is at<lb/>
his work again. Of course,<lb/>
he told you about his Florida<lb/>
trip. I had a letter from<lb/>
my partner, to-day, stating<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f13911012"/>
that he had completed plan=<lb/>
ting our grove. Had put out<lb/>
seven hundred &amp; sixty five<lb/>
fine trees &amp; had excellent wea=<lb/>
ther for planting- The grove is<lb/>
now in good condition &amp; as the<lb/>
trees are large ones, they will<lb/>
be bearing nicely in five years.<lb/>
My expense so far has been<lb/>
about <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>1000- will cost me <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>10 per<lb/>
month for care of grove, &amp; that<lb/>
is about the only expense to<lb/>
be borne. But I <hi>must</hi> close.<lb/>
Emily &amp; boy join me in best love<lb/>
&amp; kisses for your whole family,-<lb/>
And, now, my dear sister,<lb/>
trusting that you will not<lb/>
&ldquo;hide your light under a<lb/>
bushel&rdquo; I commend you &amp;<lb/>
yours, lovingly to the keeping<lb/>
of a kind Providence.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Affectionately, your brother,</salute>
<signed>Walter Reed</signed>.

P.S. &ldquo;If you<lb/>
get there<lb/>
before I do,<lb/>
tell 'Em I<lb/>
am coming<lb/>
too&rdquo;.<lb/>
