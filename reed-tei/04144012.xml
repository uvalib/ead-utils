<title>Letter from Wilbur A. Sawyer to Philip Showalter Hench, June 26, 1947</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Sawyer informs Hench that he is not in a position to approach John D. Rockefeller, Jr. on Hench's behalf, but sees no reason why Hench or the Mayo Clinic should not contact Rockefeller. Sawyer would like to hold a special session on Reed or yellow fever at the upcoming International Congress on Tropical Medicine and Malaria and solicits ideas from Hench.</p>

<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Dr. Strode has forwarded to me a copy of your<lb/>
letter of May 12, 1947, addressed to me at the<lb/>
Rockefeller Foundation, New York City. Unfortunately,<lb/>
I did not receive it until after the beginning of the<lb/>
meeting of the American Medical Association. Circum-<lb/>
stances prevented me from attending that meeting and<lb/>
running across you there.</p>
<p>As Dr. Strode informed you, I retired from the<lb/>
International Health Division in 1944, and for the<lb/>
past 3 years have been Director of Health for UNRRA.<lb/>
Now I am attached to the Division of International<lb/>
Conferences, Department of State, and am engaged in<lb/>
organizing the Fourth International Congresses on<lb/>
Tropical Medicine and Malaria to be held May 10-18,<lb/>
1948.</p>
<p>I am not in a position to approach Mr. John D.<lb/>
Rockefeller, Jr., but I see no reason why you, or<lb/>
the Mayo Clinic, should not do so. If Mr. Rockefeller<lb/>
should ask for my opinion, I should, of course, be<lb/>
very glad to give it and I feel very friendly toward<lb/>
your project.</p>
<p>There have been some developments which bear<lb/>
on your proposals and which would involve the<lb/>
Congresses which I am helping to organize. You are<lb/>
probably aware that Walter Reed was elected to the<lb/>
Hall of Fame last year but that the funds necessary<lb/>
to provide for the bust and its installation have<lb/>
not been secured. I understand that it would cost<lb/>
about $6,000. It has been suggested that it would<lb/>
be very timely if the unveiling could occur at the<lb/>
time of the international meeting on tropical medicine<lb/>
and be<lb/>
Dr. P. S. Hench,<lb/>
Mayo Clinic,<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota.<lb/>

and be related to a special session on either Walter<lb/>
Reed or yellow fever in general. It occurs to me<lb/>
that it might be of advantage if your project could<lb/>
come to a head at about the same time. Doubtless<lb/>
your discoveries in Cuba would be of interest to<lb/>
the meeting in Washington either through a talk or<lb/>
an exhibit. The plans for the yellow fever meeting<lb/>
have not yet been laid down and that is why I am so<lb/>
indefinite at this time.</p>
<p>Please let me have your comments and suggestions<lb/>
for consideration of our Program Committee.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
