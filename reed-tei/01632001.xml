<salute>My <hi>sweet</hi> &ldquo;little&rdquo; Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Punctually<lb/>
as the hands of Time reach the<lb/>
hour of 8 o'clock, I am seated<lb/>
at my writing-desk ready to<lb/>
begin my semi-weekly epistle.<lb/>
I am afraid that this, the very<lb/>
first one, will be a failure, but<lb/>
after hearing my excuses, I don't<lb/>
think you will find any room<lb/>
in your darling heart for crit-<lb/>
icism. Now listen -- This letter<lb/>
must be written and mailed be-<lb/>
fore Eleven o'clock -- Well, I hear<lb/>
you say, &ldquo;Land of the free! isn't<lb/>
there plenty of time from 8 to<lb/>
11 to write a letter&rdquo;? Yes, quite<lb/>
enough, especially when the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01632002"/>
heart is <add>so</add> thoroughly enlisted &amp;<lb/>
the hand so ready to obey.<lb/>
But at 9 o'cl'k, I have a very<lb/>
important engagement to meet,<lb/>
it being nothing less than one<lb/>
with my military tailor, &amp; upon<lb/>
my punctuality a great deal<lb/>
depends. For if my coat is not<lb/>
properly remodelled, I can't<lb/>
have any photographs taken,<lb/>
and if none are taken, none<lb/>
will be sent, &amp; if none are<lb/>
sent, I'll be miserable &amp; you,<lb/>
my darling, (I scarcely know<lb/>
what to say) will not get one!<lb/>
Now you see what a string<lb/>
of &ldquo;<hi>ifs</hi>&rdquo; there are, all of which<lb/>
can only be demolished by<lb/>
my prompt attendance at 9 o.c.<lb/>
I have still another reason-<lb/>
able excuse. It so happens,<lb/>
that in this edifice there is but<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01632003"/>
<hi>one</hi> ink-stand- As the Orator<lb/>
exclaimed, &ldquo;it stands <hi>solus</hi> &amp;<lb/>
<hi>alone</hi>&rdquo;- Its appearance is<lb/>
very humble &amp; unpretending,<lb/>
but yet it is in constant demand-<lb/>
I never had very much respect<lb/>
for it, till this morning, but<lb/>
<hi>now</hi> I don't believe it has its<lb/>
superior in the land- The reason<lb/>
of my sudden admiration is<lb/>
owing to the fact that my moth-<lb/>
er is constantly calling for this<lb/>
ink-stand, as she, too, is very<lb/>
anxious to write to <hi>her</hi> sweet-<lb/>
heart- You may wonder why<lb/>
we don't both use it, at one<lb/>
&amp; the same time -- Why, for the<lb/>
very reason that she would<lb/>
<hi>read</hi> my letter as fast as I<lb/>
<hi>write</hi> it- Indeed, she has made<lb/>
a few desperate attempts<lb/>
to read my letters since my<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01632004"/>
return, &amp; especially has she<lb/>
desired to see how I begin<lb/>
them- Whether I call you, &ldquo;my<lb/>
darling, my sweet, my pre-<lb/>
cious, my ever adorable, my<lb/>
never-to-be-forgotten,&rdquo; or whatever<lb/>
it may be- I tell her that I<lb/>
commence them simply, &ldquo;Miss<lb/>
Lawrence;&rdquo; but she professes<lb/>
too much wisdom <del>s</del> to be thus<lb/>
easily duped &amp; declares that<lb/>
I am the most unaccommodating<lb/>
boy she ever knew- I tell her<lb/>
that in order to see how I be-<lb/>
gin my letters, she must write<lb/>
to you &amp; ask your permission,<lb/>
as I never do anything without<lb/>
first consulting your wishes.<lb/>
Her only answer is, that &ldquo;she'll<lb/>
be switched if she does any such<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01632005"/>
thing&rdquo;! What this means, I am at<lb/>
a loss to say. (Ah!, my darling,<lb/>
with all her &ldquo;switchings&rdquo;, she is<lb/>
a dear good mother- Every evening,<lb/>
she, Mrs. V. &amp; I sit on the front<lb/>
porch &amp; talk of <hi>you</hi>, &amp; such<lb/>
sweet talks as we have;! I<lb/>
trust that they may never fade<lb/>
from my memory.) So that be-<lb/>
tween my pressing engagement<lb/>
&amp; a restless ink-holder, you<lb/>
must excuse the hurry of my<lb/>
letter- In my last, I spoke of<lb/>
my intention of writing to<lb/>
your mother &amp; asking her con-<lb/>
sent to my engagement with her<lb/>
youngest &amp; <hi>sweetest</hi> daughter-<lb/>
After sealing my letter, It oc-<lb/>
curred to me to delay writing<lb/>
till I could hear from you &amp;<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01632006"/>
learn your wishes in regard<lb/>
to the matter- You know, my darl-<lb/>
ing, that you deprived me of one<lb/>
opportunity of having a talk<lb/>
with your mother, &amp; since I missed<lb/>
the chance of a conversation,<lb/>
the only remaining alternative<lb/>
is to write &amp; ask her consent-<lb/>
You will agree with me that<lb/>
it would only be showing her<lb/>
that respect which her position,<lb/>
as your mother, calls for. Be-<lb/>
sides, I should feel so much<lb/>
better satisfied, with the knowl-<lb/>
edge of her approval. (The clock<lb/>
has struck 9 &amp; I must ask to be<lb/>
excused for a short while)</p>
<p>10 o'clock, and I am ready to continue<lb/>
my letter-</p>
<p>Before I forget it, I must<lb/>
speak of a matter that has just<lb/>
occurred to me- My mother, a few<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01632007"/>
days ago, during a conversation,<lb/>
said that she had heard you say<lb/>
that you would prefer being en-<lb/>
gaged with a <hi>bracelet</hi> rather<lb/>
than a ring. Is this the case?<lb/>
I believe I have heard of such<lb/>
but am not certain. I have but<lb/>
one desire in the matter &amp; that<lb/>
is to abide your good pleasure-<lb/>
If you prefer the bracelet, it<lb/>
would <add>afford</add> me very great pleasure<lb/>
to comply<del>ing</del> with your wishes.<lb/>
Don't forget, in your next letter,<lb/>
to speak of this- You will be<lb/>
surprised to learn that I <hi>have<lb/>
heard from you</hi> since I received<lb/>
your last letter- A certain gen-<lb/>
tleman, who has been in M. a<lb/>
few days, never writes home<lb/>
but that he sends some<lb/>
message- He said that Mr. Dr<lb/>
Lawrence told him what you<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01632008"/>
answered, when he asked <del>if</del> you<lb/>
if he should send a young gen-<lb/>
tleman to escort you to College.<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi>His son</hi>&rdquo; is very much gratified<lb/>
with the compliment &amp; only re-<lb/>
grets that he was not present<lb/>
to say, &ldquo;Amen&rdquo;- You need not ex-<lb/>
press any particular surprise<lb/>
if you chance to see any one<lb/>
resembling myself passing along<lb/>
your streets- My precious An-<lb/>
gel, I am so continually pres-<lb/>
ent in mind with you all the<lb/>
while, that it would be no <add>great</add> miracle<lb/>
if I should appear in body.<lb/>
It may be that I <hi>shall</hi> appear,<lb/>
in body and mind, in your<lb/>
town within the next few<lb/>
weeks- If my route should carry me<lb/>
<hi>in that direction</hi>, I'll surely come-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Till then believe, as ever, darling, your affectionate &amp;<lb/>
ever devoted,</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>-
<seg>
P.S. Ma sends<lb/>
her best love,<lb/>
&amp; declares that<lb/>
she will come<lb/>
to Murfreesboro<lb/>
soon, if you do<lb/>
not answer her<lb/>
letter-<lb/>
