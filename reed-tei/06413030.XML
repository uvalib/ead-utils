<p>Isnt it surprizing how the<lb/>
days slip by, when each day is much<lb/>
like the one before, and one feels well<lb/>
and spends the days reading. Your<lb/>
very nice letter has been on my desk<lb/>
for a month or more, and I dont think<lb/>
I have yet answered it. But I will<lb/>
do so and put on an air mail stamp<lb/>
so that spring will not catch me with<lb/>
a mid-winter letter from so good a friend<lb/>
still unanswered. I have just been talking<lb/>
to Mrs Siler over the phone about the fine<lb/>
recovery that our friend &lsquo;Dusty&rsquo; has made<lb/>
after giving us a great scare. He had a<lb/>
prostate operation early in this month.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06413031"/>
2-<lb/>
It was not malignant, thank God, but<lb/>
he had a phlebitis of the left iliac vein<lb/>
and they had to tie off the vein and turn<lb/>
out the clot. Then he had a pneumonia<lb/>
and had to live under an oxygen tent<lb/>
for a week or more. He was very ill but<lb/>
all of a sudden, he began to get better and<lb/>
is now sitting up part of each day.<lb/>
We have just had the biggest snow in<lb/>
five years, over Va. Md &amp; up to New England<lb/>
and it is now cold with a bitter west<lb/>
wind so the city is now slowly digging<lb/>
itself out. We will probably have a late<lb/>
spring this year, as we had early springs last<lb/>
year and in 1945. As this winter is the<lb/>
first when R. R. transportation has approach-<lb/>
ed normal almost every one I know<lb/>
has gone to Florida and they will have<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06413032"/>
3<lb/>
spent their money and be wanting to come home<lb/>
long before spring comes to us.</p>
<p>It was a great pleasure to hear of Jack's<lb/>
visit to you and of how will Elizabeth<lb/>
is coming on with her work.</p>
<p>Also to hear of your fine visit from Col Hench<lb/>
which he also wrote me of. I had a <lb/>
big envelope from him today with letters<lb/>
about Ames from a Dr. Berry who thinks<lb/>
Ames had a case of experimental yellow<lb/>
fever - which is of course all tommy-rot.<lb/>
I think that Col. Hench has now got the<lb/>
whole story and he should get to work on<lb/>
his magnum opus without wasting pre-<lb/>
cious time on fake heroes who try to<lb/>
climb on the band wagon after the battle<lb/>
was over. You are much mistaken if<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06413033"/>
C<hi rend="subscript">2</hi><lb/>
B<hi rend="subscript">5</hi><lb/>
you think that Col. Hench ever thought for<lb/>
a moment that you were a Dr. Victor Heiser<lb/>
He is too shrewd a judge of human nature<lb/>
ever to have a doubt of your story and<lb/>
he admires your book as much as I do.<lb/>
But he goes over the old ground again<lb/>
and again in his efforts to get additional<lb/>
facts that we may have over looked or<lb/>
forgotten. I tell him that I am a squeezed<lb/>
orange and he cannot get anything<lb/>
more out of me. You know Hench came<lb/>
all the way from Rochester, Minn. to Wash.<lb/>
to attend the Nov. meeting of the Walter Reed<lb/>
memo. Assn. and I think enjoyed it.<lb/>
I will look forward with much pleasure<lb/>
to seeing you in May when you come east<lb/>
and will save a bottle of bottled-in-bond<lb/>
to drink to your health. Cordial regards to<lb/>
Madame Bonnie and Elizabeth.</p>
