<salute>Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>With reference to radiogram sent from this office<lb/>
September 14, 1922, I have the honor to submit the<lb/>
following report of circumstances connected with the<lb/>
death on board the American Schooner &ldquo;WILLIAM E. BURNHAM&rdquo;<lb/>
at 8:55 P. M., September 13, 1922.</p>
<p>The Schooner arrived in quarantine at 8:45 A. M.,<lb/>
September 14, 1922, from Freetown, Sierra Leone W. Africa,<lb/>
calling at Paramaribo and Mungo, Dutch Guiana, and was<lb/>
promptly boarded.</p>
<p>The vessel left the United States from Gulfport,<lb/>
Miss., for West Africa, in April, 1922. It departed<lb/>
from Freetown Sierra Leone for the United States on<lb/>
June 25, 1922, via Paramaribo, Dutch Quiana, arriving<lb/>
thereat August 6, 1922. From this last named port, the<lb/>
schooner went up river to Mungo August 12, 1922, loaded<lb/>
bauxite ore, returned to Paramaribo and sailed therefrom<lb/>
on August 23, 1922.</p>
<p>P- Aug 6-12<lb/>
<unclear>Mungo</unclear><lb/>
P (left) 23<lb/>
<unclear>Sek-Spt 6</unclear></p>
<p>On arrival at Paramaribo, the vessel had to wait<lb/>
about one week before going up river, for the reason<lb/>
that the stream is so narrow, that only one vessel at<lb/>
a time can navigate it, and had to wait for another<lb/>
schooner to come down. This indicates that all this<lb/>
time, there was an intimate relation with shore. The<lb/>
vessel was in Mungo about one week and consumed five<lb/>
other days on the trip down. No night navigation was<lb/>
undertaken in the river.</p>
<p>On investigation of circumstances surrounding the<lb/>
death of <unclear>Seaman</unclear> Miguel Vicens, a Spanish subject, 47 years<lb/>
of age, the following clinical history was detailed by<lb/>
the Captain and members of the crew.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01003018"/>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>The deceased first notified the Captain of his<lb/>
illness on September 6th, and complained of headache,<lb/>
pains all over the body and high fever. He remained<lb/>
ill with fever until the 9th, when he felt better.<lb/>
On September 10th, he felt worse and the fever reached<lb/>
105, which remained high till death occurred the evening<lb/>
of September 13, 1922. He died in a <unclear>comatose</unclear> condition.<lb/>
It was ascertained that the deceased was ill a few days<lb/>
prior to the sudden onset on September 6th, that he<lb/>
vomited and had a chill, that he complained of loss of<lb/>
appetite, constipation, sore throat, that his eyes were<lb/>
bright and that the fever did not terminate at any stage<lb/>
as is the case in Malaria.</p>
<p><unclear>Death</unclear> 7 day</p>
<p>Six other members of the crew <unclear>at</unclear> various times had<lb/>
fever from the time the vessel departed from Mungo and<lb/>
subsequent to leaving Paramaribo, <unclear>but made</unclear> were in-<lb/>
<unclear>capaciteted</unclear> from duty, nor did the fever last more than<lb/>
three days in any of these cases.</p>
<p>The body was brought in quarantine therefore available<lb/>
for necropsy which was held on board the schooner the same<lb/>
date at 10:00 A.M., and the following pathological lesions<lb/>
were recorded:</p>
<p><unclear>no matter<lb/>
patal and cased</unclear></p>
<p>Entire body jaundiced.</p>
<p>Lungs: Hypostatic conjestion due to recumbent<lb/>
posture.</p>
<p>Pericardium: Slight amount of clear pericardial<lb/>
fluid.</p>
<p>Heart: About normal size, flaccid, no apparent<lb/>
degeneration.</p>
<p>Liver: Slightly enlarged pale-yellow, indicating<lb/>
fatty degeneration.</p>
<p>Gall Bladder: Distended and filled with bile,<lb/>
some transudation of bile staining<lb/>
neighboring organs. No stones found in<lb/>
the organ, or in any of the biliary<lb/>
passages, no perforation or rupture.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f01003019"/>
<p>- 3 -</p>
<p>Stomach: About normal size, containing a<lb/>
yellowish fluid, apparently bile<lb/>
stained.</p>
<p>Appendix: Retrococeal and adherent.</p>
<p>Spleen: Enlarged to approximately twice<lb/>
normal size very friable and on<lb/>
section the spleen substance bulged<lb/>
out having the consistency of a<lb/>
solid or semi-solid blood clot,<lb/>
no rupture or other injury detected.</p>
<p>Kidneys: Left enlarged, considerable larger<lb/>
than the right.</p>
<p>Other Organs: Hegative.</p>
<p>Blood smears made and about five ounces of urine<lb/>
obtained by catherization, which an examination at this<lb/>
station's laboratory at 2:00 P. M., recorded the following:</p>
<p>Blood: <unclear>Negative</unclear> for Malaria, increase in<lb/>
mononuclears.</p>
<p>Urine: Color, concentrated yellow; Sp. Gr., 1020;<lb/>
Reaction, acid, Albumin, large amount<lb/>
(specimen almost solidified on boiling);<lb/>
Sugar, none; Bile present.<lb/>
Microscopically:- Few epithelial casts;<lb/>
epithelial cells, occasional blood cells.</p>
<p>The clinical history as obtained from the Captain<lb/>
and crew of the &ldquo;WILLIAM E. BURNHAM&rdquo;, indicated that the<lb/>
death in this case was due to a severe infection of some<lb/>
sort, closely coinciding with that found in yellow fever,<lb/>
except, as to incubation period, which is greater than<lb/>
the generally admitted six days. It is possible however,<lb/>
that the case was one of walking yellow fever originally<lb/>
or that an infected mosquito <unclear>may</unclear> have gone aboard the<lb/>
vessel in Paramaribo or vicinity and that it ripened and<lb/>
subsequently infected the case.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f01003020"/>
<p>- 4 -</p>
<p>The post mortem findings of jaundice, fatty liver,<lb/>
excessive albuminuria, soft enlarged spleen and the<lb/>
absence of malaria parasites in the blood, point clearly<lb/>
to yellow fever.</p>
<p>The case was considered as yellow fever, but no<lb/>
efforts were spared to prove something else.</p>
<p>Vessel fumigated and vessel and crew detained for<lb/>
six days.</p>
<p>Blood examinations of all humans on board were<lb/>
negative for malaria. Temperature of all taken twice<lb/>
daily.</p>
<p>On the written request of the Captain, copy inclosed,<lb/>
the body of Miguel Vicens, was interned in the quarantine<lb/>
reservation at 5:00 P. M., September 14, 1922.</p>
