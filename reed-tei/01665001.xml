<salute>My own, precious E.;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your<lb/>
letter to hand, at last- and I per-<lb/>
ceive that you have decided<lb/>
to change the day of writing.<lb/>
I trust that this is only tem-<lb/>
porary, however, and <add>that</add> when you<lb/>
return to Murfreesboro, you<lb/>
will again adopt Friday as<lb/>
the day for correspondence- (that<lb/>
is, the portion of your time that<lb/>
will be devoted to me) for, I<lb/>
suppose the Baltimore gentleman<lb/>
must have, at least, one day out<lb/>
of seven. I want Friday, anyway,<lb/>
as my day, for then your let-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01665002"/>
ters will reach me on Monday, &amp; it is so pleasant<lb/>
<add>&amp;</add> cheering to get a letter from one's darling little<lb/>
Sweetheart early in the week- It makes my heart<lb/>
glad &amp; inspires me with new zeal for the pers-<lb/>
ecution of the week's labor-</p>
<p>So you have had a talk with Miss Annie on<lb/>
the subject of Irony? I am really sorry that<lb/>
I was not present to take part in it, since<lb/>
I not only would have heard what would<lb/>
be of advantage to me, but it would, also<lb/>
have afforded me a chance of looking upon<lb/>
your darling face- Surely, Miss Annie could<lb/>
not reproduce the contents of my letter, after<lb/>
so long a time has elapsed? I am sure that<lb/>
I have forgotten the greater part of it; but<lb/>
if you will read the letter that I <hi>did</hi> send,<lb/>
I am certain you will there find my views<lb/>
on the subject fully expressed, and I feel con-<lb/>
fident that they are in accordance with<lb/>
your sister's ideas- Yes, my darling E; it was<lb/>
upon the reception of your first letter, couched<lb/>
in that style of writing, that I, in reply, begged<lb/>
that you would abandon it, as I feared that<lb/>
it would lead to consequences which both of us<lb/>
would regret- Did you so decide? Remember<lb/>
that I am <add>not</add> trying to offer an excuse for myself-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01665003"/>
I acknowledge that, time after time, I have been<lb/>
guilty, and have often been sorry that I ad-<lb/>
opted the style; and yet in my next letter I re-<lb/>
peated it- To your question; &ldquo;would you have our<lb/>
hearts estranged&rdquo;? I answer, I <hi>would not</hi>: <hi>no</hi>, <hi>not<lb/>
for all that this world could bestow</hi>! Nothing could<lb/>
possibly happen which would occasion me such<lb/>
grief, as the knowledge that you had ceased to<lb/>
love me! This is the only thing in my poor, barren<lb/>
career that I can behold with pride &amp; pleasure!<lb/>
I ask no prouder distinction than to be reckoned<lb/>
worthy of your love! But right here, my darling,<lb/>
is where the whole secret of the style, iron-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01665004"/>
ical, is hidden- You would keep<lb/>
from me the fact that you love<lb/>
me- You hold to the idea that the<lb/>
heart of man must be bruised<lb/>
in order to extract its fragrance,<lb/>
and you would by various lit-<lb/>
tle sentences, <hi>seemingly</hi> indiffe-<lb/>
rent to my sensibilities, seek to<lb/>
bruise and extract- And though you<lb/>
are not willing that I should<lb/>
think otherwise than that you<lb/>
hold me in friendly esteem, yet<lb/>
<del>you</del> would <add>you not</add> have me, my darling,<lb/>
prostrate myself at your feet?<lb/>
I have often wondered that<lb/>
a lady, after accepting &amp; promising<lb/>
(I am <hi>not referring to you</hi>)<lb/>
to marry a gentleman, should<lb/>
take so many occasions to show<lb/>
him that she cared <add>but little</add><del>nothing</del> for <hi>him</hi>-<lb/>
and everything for some other gentleman-<lb/>
a course which is certain to<lb/>
engender feelings of jealousy<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01665005"/>
within<lb/>
his breast,<lb/>
<hi>provided he love<lb/>
the lady</hi>. You may be<lb/>
surprised at my state-<lb/>
ment; but I candidly believe<lb/>
my darling Emilie, that the man<lb/>
or woman does not exist who would<lb/>
not be rendered jealous by such a course-<lb/>
I pray that, in the sentence <hi>previous</hi> <add>(on the other page)</add> to this one,<lb/>
<del>that</del> you will not take it as referring to yourself-<lb/>
I am merely speaking of the result of my observation.<lb/>
And whenever you behold a lady, who is engaged, <del>putting</del><lb/>
pretending that she cares nothing for her lover, does it seem to<lb/>
you like the sober sense of those who had arrived at maturity<lb/>
and had found a just idea of the responsibilities which she had<lb/>
assumed? or does it not rather appear as the silly fancies of<lb/>
premature womanhood? If such things are to be regretted in<lb/>
the conduct of a lady, how much more should they be discon<lb/>
tenanced when practiced by a gentleman? Ah! my darling E,<lb/>
neither you nor I are willing to abandon &ldquo;Irony&rdquo;- Oh! no! <hi>we</hi> have<lb/>
the most implicit confidence in each other and in our ability to<lb/>
check it on the slightest appearance of any estrange-<lb/>
ment! <hi>we</hi> are thorough adepts at wielding an Ironi-<lb/>
cal pen, &amp; <add>can</add> gauge it so nicely that its arrows<lb/>
will only pierce surface-deep-just<lb/>
<del>fan</del> deep enough to sting a little!<lb/>
what though a darling Sister<lb/>
who has passed along the<lb/>
same road, should<lb/>
caution us,<lb/>
by the love<lb/>
she bears<lb/>
us;<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01665006"/>
why should <hi>we</hi> listen to that?<lb/>
Are <hi>we</hi> not <hi>wiser</hi> than <hi>all</hi> who<lb/>
have gone before? and will we<lb/>
not show our friends, that we<lb/>
can yet love just as well, although<lb/>
we daily insist upon it that we<lb/>
have not the remotest interest<lb/>
in each other! Oh! Emilie, Emilie<lb/>
darling, into what treacherous<lb/>
waters are our barks drifting!<lb/>
Shall we discard that which will<lb/>
daily imperil<del>s</del> our safety, or shall<lb/>
we retain it, only to regret our<lb/>
shortsightedness when our hopes<lb/>
&amp; happiness are wrecked!<lb/>
Oh! listen to the golden advice<lb/>
of your darling Sister, and may<lb/>
God, in his mercy, keep you free<lb/>
from all sorrow-!</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, ever, darling,<lb/>
your fond &amp; devoted,</salute>
<signed>W.</signed>
<seg>
P.S. Im telling you of the ban-<lb/>
quet that I was enjoying,<lb/>
I had not the slightest idea<lb/>
of making you &ldquo;envious&rdquo;, &amp; as<lb/>
there were <hi>no ladies</hi> present<lb/>
on either occasion, I am at<lb/>
a loss to know how a simple<lb/>
evening's enjoyment with gentlemen<lb/>
could <hi>possibly</hi> make you<lb/>
&ldquo;Envious&rdquo;--
