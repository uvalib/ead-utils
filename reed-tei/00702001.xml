<salute>Dear Mother:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The mail must be <unclear>in</unclear> between Cairo &amp;<lb/>
<unclear>Beneblana</unclear>, as I most certainly wrote last week &amp; your Sun-<lb/>
day letter reached me Friday, (or Thursday) morning. I've had<lb/>
an accidental week, Sunday evening I went down to a<lb/>
boat to dress a couple of broken ribs; you remember how hot<lb/>
it was &amp; I, by myself except for my patient, in the<lb/>
close hold of the vessel I nearly melted. Saturday I got<lb/>
a small boy (9 years with a broken thigh &amp;, Saturday even-<lb/>
ing another with a fish hook in his hand (took chloro-<lb/>
form &amp; had it cut out) Monday night was called up<lb/>
to see a Sunstroke &amp; a little later to see a man<lb/>
who had fallen 65 feet, from the top of a flag pole. &amp;<lb/>
who <unclear>w<del>l</del>as</unclear> terribly injured. Also a stab wound on Wednes-<lb/>
day. Most of my cases are rather bad ones now. I've one<lb/>
boy of <unclear>19, Frakes,</unclear> who has what is called here &ldquo;Conges-<lb/>
tion of the stomach &amp; bowels.&rdquo; A kind of cholera <unclear>morbis</unclear> that<lb/>
lasts from 3 days to a week &amp; that kills if not attended<lb/>
to. Being put on <unclear>light</unclear> diet the day he entered (Friday) he<lb/>
got up at night &amp; stole all the <unclear>fruit</unclear> he could find about a<lb/>
<unclear>peck</unclear>, (bananas, oranges &amp; apples). Well, yesterday he nearly died &amp;<lb/>
I did work over him, &amp; so last night. This morning he was <unclear>a</unclear><lb/>
great deal better, &amp; after teasing for pie, etc &amp; being denied<lb/>
I found him when I went up at noon to see <hi>him</hi>, in the<lb/>
orchard eating green apples, he said he had eaten only 4 or 5, I<lb/>
hope so. He is a good deal worse now, I had explained to him what<lb/>
was my reason for keeping him <unclear>on</unclear> light diet &amp; it is hard to un-<lb/>
derstand how a man can be so silly. If he dies, I will no<lb/>
<unclear>way</unclear> consider myself to blame</p>

<p>About the man who <unclear>fell</unclear> from the flag pole, he<lb/>
was about as badly broken up as any one I ever saw, that to have<lb/>
his limbs broken. 2 ribs <add>(or one)</add> were <unclear>seen</unclear> in his lungs (4 being broken)<lb/>
&amp; a bad scalp wound, which now has dead bone in it, but I<lb/>
<hi>think</hi> he will recover, he certainly is doing well so far: So is my<lb/>
<unclear>boy with</unclear> the leg - this is a private case. Very tired <unclear>of lying in bed</unclear><lb/>
but the leg is in good position &amp; he has no pain. Tell Ed it is set<lb/>
by <hi>extension</hi> (4 lbs of shot) &amp; binders board, &amp; I will put him<lb/>
in an &ldquo;Anterior Suspensory Splint&rdquo; as soon as may be, also<lb/>
that I <hi>don't like plaster</hi>. I've seen <hi>3</hi> <unclear>infected</unclear> fractures with<lb/>
it &amp; <hi>none</hi> where it was not used.</p>
<p>Ed is at home now, isn't he? &amp; so is May. I am so glad that you<lb/>
have them. It is a good thing that Ed will stay at North River<lb/>
this summer. I'm glad of it for my reasons &amp; especially for your<lb/>
sake, I wish I could be there also &amp; if I can get away in the fall I'll<lb/>
do so. It doesn't <unclear>seem</unclear> so long since I was at <unclear>home</unclear> &amp; I've changed very<lb/>
little, but I'd have such a lot to tell. It would do me a great<lb/>
deal of good too to be with my own people again. But, if I<lb/>
ain't at home, I feel as if I wasn't much separated from you;<lb/>
as if I was one <unclear>destined</unclear> to go out &amp; make something to help<lb/>
start the rest. What time will <unclear>Chas,</unclear> go to <unclear>college?</unclear> in a-<lb/>
<unclear>bout a fortnight!</unclear> I'm glad that he &amp; Ed will <hi>overlap</hi> in<lb/>
their times. Aren't you glad to have May at home again? How<lb/>
is her health? <hi>How does quinine disagree with Emma</hi>? It is quite<lb/>
fashionable to say so out here. Every negro man, says he can't take<lb/>
quinine, it &ldquo;affects&rdquo; him. I give him the pills or the solu-<lb/>
tion &amp; say nothing about it &amp; he takes it &amp; gets well,</p>
<p>This is the end of the Fiscal year &amp; I've <unclear>no</unclear> end of work to do, began<lb/>
on it yesterday, I can do as much work as the next man</p>
<p>You used to say <unclear>He'll</unclear> never <unclear>write</unclear> more than one page &amp; one<lb/>
line. I can't say all I want on 4 pages but my time runs out.</p>
