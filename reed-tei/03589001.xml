Dr. Eduardo Angles<lb/>
19 General Lee Street<lb/>
Marianao, Havana<lb/>
Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Angles:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting you with Mr. Moran in April when<lb/>
I was doing some medical historical researches on Walter Reed and his yellow<lb/>
fever work. I have been asked to make a report to the Cuban government explain-<lb/>
ing why I think they have erroneously located the site of Camp Lazear by the<lb/>
railroad track behind Military City. I will appreciate very much your telling<lb/>
me what you know of this. I understand that you were connected in some way<lb/>
with the yellow fever work at that time. I should like to know just what<lb/>
your relationship was. I recollect your telling me that although you believed<lb/>
that Camp Lazear had been properly located by the government, you had known<lb/>
of a &ldquo;provisional camp&rdquo; established by Reed on the farm of Dr. Rojas in<lb/>
Quemados.</p>
<p>I would appreciate greatly if you would write me what you know<lb/>
about this.</p>
<p>Also may I ask your help in another matter? In 1900, Walter Reed<lb/>
first began to suspect that yellow fever was due to a winged agent when he<lb/>
noticed that yellow fever jumped from #102 Real Street around the corner to<lb/>
#20 General Lee Street, and then to another house right across from the latter<lb/>
house. Mr. Moran and I found houses #102 Real Street and #20 General Lee Street.<lb/>
I wondered whether these were the same houses or whether the numbers had been<lb/>
changed sometime since 1900, but Senor Angel Suarez-Solis, who lives in #102 Real<lb/>
Street, insisted that that house number had not been changed. Could you tell me<lb/>
who now lives in #20 General Lee Street? I should like to write him. Do you<lb/>
think this number may have been changed? Also do you know who lives right across<lb/>
from #20 General Lee Street? I gather that this must be very close to your own<lb/>
home, and assuming that you know the names of these residents, I am taking the<lb/>
liberty of asking you this great favor.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
