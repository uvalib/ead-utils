<p>1</p>
<p>A month prior to Dr. Reed's last<lb/>
illness on his home-coming in<lb/>
the evening I would be shocked<lb/>
with the impress that his day's<lb/>
work had made upon him,--<lb/>
as he sat opposite me at din-<lb/>
ner and I looked upon his<lb/>
worn face it seemed as if<lb/>
time was daily adding years<lb/>
instead of hours to his life-<lb/>
He complained so often of wea-<lb/>
riness both mentally &amp; physically<lb/>
and to lecture seemed such a<lb/>
difficult task. I remember<lb/>
one night just before going<lb/>
to the Columbia Lecture Hall<lb/>
that he took his manuscript<lb/>
and as he scanned the pages<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14157002"/>
2<lb/>
he shook his head and<lb/>
remarked to me, &ldquo;I can't<lb/>
realize that I wrote this<lb/>
lecture, it is utterly beyond<lb/>
my mental capacity now-&rdquo;<lb/>
Indeed so changed was he<lb/>
at home where he took the priv-<lb/>
ilege to make known his real<lb/>
feelings that I felt there was<lb/>
some impending calamity-<lb/>
Before his friends he exerted<lb/>
himself to keep up his usual<lb/>
flow of spirits and it was only<lb/>
to his faithful old messenger<lb/>
at the museum did he give<lb/>
vent to his feelings, saying<lb/>
&ldquo;Beechner, I am a sick man&rdquo;.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14157003"/>
4<lb/>
On Wednesday the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Nov.<lb/>
he returned from his Office<lb/>
earlier than usual &amp; remarked<lb/>
that he had eaten something<lb/>
for lunch that had disagreed<lb/>
with him &amp; he felt so badly<lb/>
that he did not go to his<lb/>
lecture <add>that night</add>- The next morning<lb/>
he remained in bed till<lb/>
about eleven o'clock &amp; then<lb/>
went out, but still complaining.<lb/>
Both on Wednesday &amp; Thursday<lb/>
he had one or two of the <del>Doctor,</del> <add>his medical</add><lb/>
friends to examine him, but<lb/>
they all agreed that <del>I</del> it was<lb/>
not his appendix that was crea-<lb/>
ting the trouble though the<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14157004"/>
5<lb/>
pain really caused him to limp.<lb/>
On Friday in the early after-<lb/>
noon Dr. Borden <del>of</del> <add>who is</add> the Army<lb/>
expert on appendecitis again<lb/>
examined him &amp; found the<lb/>
appendix sensitive &amp; brought<lb/>
him home in his Carriage<lb/>
&amp; ordered him to take his<lb/>
bed- He called that night<lb/>
at 10 o'clock found Dr. Reed<lb/>
in considerable pain though<lb/>
his temperature was not<lb/>
excessive &amp; his pulse good-<lb/>
All through the night he com-<lb/>
plained of pain &amp; had a rest-<lb/>
less night- Through out Saturday<lb/>
he was comfortable &amp; Dr. B<lb/>
thought he would be well<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14157005"/>
6<lb/>
enough to be operated on by<lb/>
the following Wednesday.<lb/>
Saturday night was a most<lb/>
restful one &amp; Sunday morning<lb/>
found him so bright that<lb/>
I told him I thought the<lb/>
little stay in bed had done<lb/>
him much good- His tem-<lb/>
perature was almost normal<lb/>
&amp; he insisted upon having<lb/>
some solid food for break-<lb/>
fast saying that he felt<lb/>
well enough to eat some<lb/>
waffles (his favorite Sunday<lb/>
morning bread) but of course<lb/>
I denied him anything<lb/>
but the liquid diet prescribed- He sat up in bed<lb/>
most of the day, read his<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14157006"/>
<del>4</del>7<lb/>
papers, talked of the improve-<lb/>
ments we were to make at<lb/>
our Summer home in the<lb/>
Spring, what we would<lb/>
plant in the garden etc.<lb/>
Took much pleasure in<lb/>
seeing his friends and<lb/>
indeed seemed more like<lb/>
himself than he had for<lb/>
weeks. That evening about<lb/>
eight o'clock I noticed<lb/>
that he <del>pulled</del> <add>tucked</add> the sheet<lb/>
snugly around him &amp; when I<lb/>
question him, he confessed<lb/>
that he felt chilly- I imme-<lb/>
diately phoned for Dr. Borden<lb/>
&amp; upon taking his temperature<lb/>
he found that it had gone<lb/>
up- Dr. Borden called in<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f14157007"/>
8<lb/>
Dr. J. R. Kean of the Army whose<lb/>
appartment was near ours &amp;<lb/>
they agreed that an operation<lb/>
was necessary <del>in</del> the <add>next</add> morning.<lb/>
I did not close my eyes<lb/>
in sleep that night and<lb/>
I feel that he did not either<lb/>
but the night passed in<lb/>
silence- I was not brave<lb/>
enough to speak and<lb/>
if he was in pain he<lb/>
gave no evidence of it-<lb/>
Early the next morning<lb/>
he was taken to the<lb/>
Army Hospital at Washing<lb/>
ton Barracks, but he in-<lb/>
sisted upon walking from<lb/>
his bed room to the front door<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f14157008"/>
<del>8</del> 9<lb/>
and stopped in the library<lb/>
sat down at his desk &amp;<lb/>
wrote out a check.</p>
<p>He was operated on at about<lb/>
noon- temperature &amp; pulse both<lb/>
normal- Just before going<lb/>
upon the operating table he<lb/>
took his dear friend Dr. Kean<lb/>
to one side &amp; said to him,<lb/>
&ldquo;Kean I am not afraid of<lb/>
the knife, but if any thing<lb/>
should happen I am leaving<lb/>
my wife &amp; daughter so little&rdquo;,<lb/>
and as he went under the in-<lb/>
fluence of the ether his last<lb/>
words were, &ldquo;so little, so little&rdquo;.<lb/>
The Drs. were surprised to<lb/>
find things in so serious<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f14157009"/>
10<lb/>
a condition, a rupture taking<lb/>
place during the operation-<lb/>
The after effects of the ether were<lb/>
most distressing and his <unclear></unclear><lb/>
gave way entirely. Dr. Borden said<lb/>
he had never seen a woman<lb/>
more hysterical-</p>
<p>I had been under treatment<lb/>
for nervousness for several months<lb/>
at the time that Dr. was taken<lb/>
ill and he realizing my con-<lb/>
dition prefered that I post-<lb/>
pone my visits till he was<lb/>
better able to controll himself,<lb/>
so I only saw him for<lb/>
just a moment, twice <del>while</del><lb/>
during the fatal week. Even<lb/>
those moments were thoughts<lb/>
of me, and his greeting<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f14157010"/>
11<lb/>
was, &ldquo;sweetheart this is no<lb/>
place for you&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And the second- &ldquo;Darling stay<lb/>
away till I send for you&rdquo;.<lb/>
That was all -- God alone<lb/>
knows what anguish it<lb/>
was to stay away, but Dr.<lb/>
Borden said he was too ill<lb/>
to take any risks.</p>
<p>I feel that I know <hi>so<lb/>
little</hi> concerning him that<lb/>
last week and when the<lb/>
end came I was so ill<lb/>
that <del>the Dr.</del> <add>a physician</add> was constantly<lb/>
with me- Our little daughter<lb/>
was taken into the room <del>for</del><lb/>
a few hours before his death<lb/>
but if he was conscious of<lb/>
his condition he did not<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f14157011"/>
12<lb/>
let her know it-</p>
<p>He had often told me<lb/>
that he did not like<lb/>
death-bed scenes and <hi>he</hi><lb/>
was spared that agony, con-<lb/>
sequently I have been willing<lb/>
to add the crushing sorrow<lb/>
of that week's separation to<lb/>
my heavy burdens feeling that<lb/>
in some slight way I shared<lb/>
them- The care &amp; devotions<lb/>
of his brother medical of-<lb/>
ficers was beautiful, and<lb/>
I know that all that med-<lb/>
ical skill &amp; faithful nur-<lb/>
sing could do not done<lb/>
for him- and as<lb/>
Bishop Lawrence of Mass.<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f14157012"/>
13<lb/>
so beautifully said to me,<lb/>
&ldquo;Let us feel that the<lb/>
Master had still greater<lb/>
work for him to do,<lb/>
and He took him&rdquo;-</p>
