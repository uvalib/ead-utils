<p>THE BALTIMORE NEWS, WEDNESDAY.</p>
<p>CAUSES YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>THE MOSQUITO RESPONSIBLE FOR<lb/>
SPREAD OF DISEASE.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Camp Lazear Experiments Seem Con-<lb/>
clusive On This Point--Infected<lb/>
Clothing Not Dangerous.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>It has been proved definitely that malaria<lb/>
is inseparably connected with a mosquito.<lb/>
The insect acts as the intermediate host in<lb/>
spreading this disease. There is now evi-<lb/>
dence that yellow fever is also caused in<lb/>
human beings by the mosquito, but a dif-<lb/>
ferent species--one which is not often<lb/>
found in the northern part of this coun-<lb/>
try. The mosquito known to physicians<lb/>
and other scientists as the anopheles<lb/>
causes malaria; that one known as culex<lb/>
fasciatus causes yellow fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first thought one might be tempted<lb/>
to characterize the experiments upon hu-<lb/>
man beings as unwarrantable,&rdquo; said a<lb/>
prominent doctor; &ldquo;but as everything was<lb/>
done with the full consent and full knowl-<lb/>
edge of the nature of the experiment on<lb/>
the part of the non-immunes who placed<lb/>
themselves at the disposal of the experi-<lb/>
menters, and considering the thousands of<lb/>
human lives which will be saved and re-<lb/>
lieved from suffering by these experi-<lb/>
ments, there can remain no honest reason<lb/>
for complaint on this score. This is espe-<lb/>
cially so in instances where the doctors<lb/>
who conducted these experiments experi-<lb/>
mented upon themselves. These are exam-<lb/>
ples of an unselfish devotion to the cause<lb/>
of humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assigned To Investigate Fever.</p>
<p>Drs. Jesse W. Lazear, Walter Reed (who<lb/>
is to lecture before the Medical and Chi-<lb/>
rurgical Society in Baltimore on Thursday<lb/>
night), James Carroll and Aristides Agra-<lb/>
mente, all of the Medical Department of<lb/>
the United States Army, were directed by<lb/>
Surgeon General Sternberg to investigate<lb/>
the cause of yellow fever, and were as-<lb/>
signed to Cuba. Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood,<lb/>
M. D., who is Military Governor of the<lb/>
Island of Cuba, assisted the above Com-<lb/>
mission in its studies of the cause of yel-<lb/>
low fever.</p>
<p>To avoid any possible source of infection<lb/>
to those individuals who were to be ob-<lb/>
served, a location for an ideal camp was<lb/>
selected in an open field, about one mile<lb/>
from Quemados, Cuba. Here an experi-<lb/>
mental sanitary station was established.</p>
<p>Died By The Experiment.</p>
<p>While unselfishly experimenting for the<lb/>
cause of the disease as produced by mos-<lb/>
quitoes, Dr. Jesse W. Lazear, one of the<lb/>
Commission and a Johns Hopkins man,<lb/>
died of yellow fever from the mosquito<lb/>
which was allowed to bite him. Twelve<lb/>
days after having been bitten he developed<lb/>
a fatal case of yellow fever. In his honor<lb/>
the station was then called Camp Lazear.</p>
<p>The personnel of this camp consisted of<lb/>
two medical officers, one immune and the<lb/>
other non-immune; one hospital steward,<lb/>
an immune; nine privates of the Hospital<lb/>
Corps, one of whom was immune, and an<lb/>
immune ambulance driver. Hospital tents,<lb/>
well drained, exposed to sunlight and<lb/>
properly floored, were provided, placed 20<lb/>
feet apart and numbered 1 to 7. The camp<lb/>
was established on November 20 last, and<lb/>
was strictly quarantined. No one was per-<lb/>
mitted to leave or enter the camp except<lb/>
the three immunes and the Commissioners.</p>
<p>Offered Themselves As Subjects.</p>
<p>Privates of the Hospital Corps, United<lb/>
States Army, offered themselves, volunta-<lb/>
rily and with full knowledge of the experi-<lb/>
ments, to be bitten by various species of<lb/>
mosquitoes which had been allowed to bite<lb/>
victims of fatal and dangerous cases of<lb/>
yellow fever at various times.</p>
<p>The temperatures and pulses were tested<lb/>
every three hours in Camp Lazear, in or-<lb/>
der that the earliest symptoms could be<lb/>
noted.</p>
<p>Four hospital aids who were bitten by<lb/>
the species of mosquito called culex fas-<lb/>
ciatus, 12 or 14 days after the insects had<lb/>
bitten yellow-fever patients, developed<lb/>
cases of yellow fever. The only cases of<lb/>
yellow fever which appeared were those<lb/>
bitten by these mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The precision with which the infection<lb/>
followed the bite of the mosquito fulfills<lb/>
the requirements of a scientific experi-<lb/>
ment.</p>
<p>From the above facts alone it was def-<lb/>
initely proved that this special mosquito<lb/>
causes yellow fever. But Drs. Reed, Car-<lb/>
roll and Agramente, in order to leave no<lb/>
doubt in the minds of the most skeptical,<lb/>
went further and adduced even more con-<lb/>
clusive proofs that the mosquito causes<lb/>
this dreaded disease, and that nothing else<lb/>
but the mosquito causes it.</p>
<p>The parasite which causes yellow fever,<lb/>
after it has been taken into the mosquito's<lb/>
stomach, requires a certain number of<lb/>
days to elapse before it is able to reinfect<lb/>
human beings. This period represents the<lb/>
time necessary for the micro-organism to<lb/>
pass from the mosquito's stomach to its<lb/>
salivary glands. This time is 12 days in<lb/>
summer weather and about 18 days in<lb/>
cooler weather.</p>
<p>After showing conclusively that yellow<lb/>
fever is conveyed by the culex fasciatus,<lb/>
they proved that this disease cannot be<lb/>
acquired in any other manner except (like<lb/>
malaria, which is also caused by the<lb/>
mosquito bite) by the injection of blood<lb/>
taken from the yellow-fever patients.<lb/>
Four of the doctors were subjected to<lb/>
this method and three of them had yel-<lb/>
low fever. These experiments were made<lb/>
by taking two cubic centimeters of blood<lb/>
from the veins in the forearm with a<lb/>
sterilized hypodermic syringe from the<lb/>
yellow-fever patient and inoculating the<lb/>
non-immune doctor with his full knowl-<lb/>
edge and consent.</p>
<p>The origin of epidemics of yellow fever<lb/>
has been frequently attributed to the un-<lb/>
packing of trunks and boxes that con-<lb/>
tained supposedly infected clothing, and<lb/>
thorough disinfection of all clothing and<lb/>
bedding from yellow-fever ports are re-<lb/>
quired by all countries, both at the ports<lb/>
of departure and of arrival. The mere fact<lb/>
that the individual has resided even a few<lb/>
days in an infected district has been suffi-<lb/>
cient to subject his baggage to rigid dis-<lb/>
infection by the sanitary authorities.</p>
<p>Tested Infection From Clothing.</p>
<p>Drs. Reed, Carroll and Agramente, in<lb/>
order to find out whether clothing and<lb/>
bedding which had been contaminated by<lb/>
the yellow-fever patients could convey<lb/>
this awful disease, tested by actual ex-<lb/>
periments upon themselves and other<lb/>
non-immune human beings this long-held<lb/>
theory. A small frame house called the<lb/>
&ldquo;Infected Clothing and Bedding Building&rdquo;<lb/>
was erected at Camp Lazear. It was<lb/>
tightly ceiled within with tongue and<lb/>
grooved boards and well battened out-<lb/>
side. It was provided with two small win-<lb/>
dows. All openings faced the south in<lb/>
order to prevent any circulation of air<lb/>
currents within the house. Permanent<lb/>
small meshed wire screens closed the<lb/>
windows and sliding glass sashes and<lb/>
heavy wooden shutters outside to pre-<lb/>
vent the entrance of sunlight. The disin-<lb/>
fecting qualities of sunlight could not<lb/>
thus be exerted.</p>
<p>Entrance into this house was also ef-<lb/>
fected from the south through a small<lb/>
vestibule. A solid door outside and a<lb/>
wire screen in the middle protected it;<lb/>
mosquitoes were thus effectually excluded.<lb/>
During the day and until after sunset<lb/>
this house was kept securely closed.</p>
<p>Three large boxes filled with sheets,<lb/>
pillow-slips and blankets, contaminated<lb/>
by contact with yellow fever patients and<lb/>
their discharges were placed inside. Many<lb/>
of these articles were soiled with black<lb/>
vomit.</p>
<p>Slept In Infected Beds.</p>
<p>One doctor and two of the hospital<lb/>
corps, all non-immunes, young Amer-<lb/>
icans, entered this building and deliber-<lb/>
ately unpacked these boxes. They handled<lb/>
and shook each article vigorously in order<lb/>
to disseminate all of the yellow fever<lb/>
agents about the building. They used<lb/>
the soiled pillows, sheets, blankets, etc.,<lb/>
to prepare the beds in which they slept,<lb/>
and all other articles were hung around<lb/>
the room.</p>
<p>This room was thus occupied each night<lb/>
by these three non-immunes for 20 days.<lb/>
From time to time fresh articles from<lb/>
yellow fever patients were sent inside.<lb/>
Their odor was sometimes so offensive<lb/>
that they had at times to come out in<lb/>
order to breathe freely.</p>
<p>Came Out In Perfect Health.</p>
<p>When these three were finally given<lb/>
their liberty they were in perfect health<lb/>
and remained so, in spite of their un-<lb/>
wholesome surroundings. Two new non-<lb/>
immunes entered this house for 20 days<lb/>
with equal success, and this experiment<lb/>
was repeated a third time, under even<lb/>
more disagreeable conditions.</p>
<p>Therefore Drs. Reed, Carroll and Agra-<lb/>
mente conclude that this disease cannot<lb/>
be transmitted through the agency of<lb/>
wearing apparel, or merchandise of any<lb/>
kind, bedding or anything inanimate.</p>
<p>To discover exactly how a house be-<lb/>
comes infected with yellow fever these<lb/>
famous investigators went further. They<lb/>
erected a second house like the Building<lb/>
No. 1, and to be known as Building No. 2.<lb/>
In this they placed the doors and windows<lb/>
upon opposite sides, in order to have thor-<lb/>
ough ventilation. Everything which en-<lb/>
tered No. 2 was carefully disinfected.</p>
<p>The Mosquitoes Did It.</p>
<p>Fifteen mosquitoes -- culex fasciatus --<lb/>
which had just bitten severe cases of yel-<lb/>
low fever, were set free in the large room<lb/>
of this building. A non-immune American<lb/>
entered the room where the mosquitoes<lb/>
had been freed and remained only 30 min-<lb/>
utes. During this time he was bitten about<lb/>
the face and hands by several insects. The<lb/>
following day he again entered and was<lb/>
again bitten. Three days later he devel-<lb/>
oped a severe case of yellow fever. There<lb/>
was no other source for his infection be-<lb/>
cause he had been strictly quarantined in<lb/>
Camp Lazear for thirty-odd days prior to<lb/>
his exposure in the mosquito building.</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear The Only Victim.</p>
<p>Now, what is especially important every<lb/>
one of those who was experimented upon<lb/>
in the above experiments and developed<lb/>
yellow fever recovered, owing to the early<lb/>
diagnosis and new methods employed in<lb/>
treating the disease. From the above ex-<lb/>
periments upon these few devoted and<lb/>
self-sacrificing doctors and nurses, Dr.<lb/>
Jesse W. Lazear, the first one bitten, was<lb/>
the only one who succumbed to the dis-<lb/>
ease. His death saved all of the others.</p>
<p>Conclusions Reached.</p>
<p>Doctors Reed, Carroll and Agramente<lb/>
publish the following conclusions in a pre-<lb/>
liminary report in the Journal of the<lb/>
American Medical Association:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1.) The mosquito known as culex fas-<lb/>
ciatus serves as the intermediate host for<lb/>
the parasite of yellow fever.</item>
<item>(2.) Yellow fever is transmitted to the<lb/>
non-immune individual by means of the<lb/>
bite of the mosquito that has previously<lb/>
fed on the blood of those sick with this<lb/>
disease.</item>
<item>(3.) An interval of 12 days or more after<lb/>
contamination appears to be necessary be-<lb/>
fore the mosquito is capable of conveying<lb/>
the infection.</item>
<item>(4.) The bite of a mosquito at an earlier<lb/>
period after contamination does not ap-<lb/>
pear to confer any immunity against a<lb/>
subsequent attack.</item>
<item>(5.) Yellow fever can be produced by<lb/>
subcutaneous injection of blood from a<lb/>
yellow fever patient taken during the first<lb/>
and second days.</item>
<item>(6.) An attack of yellow fever produced<lb/>
by the bite of the mosquito confers im-<lb/>
munity from the disease.</item>
<item>(7.) The period of development of the dis-<lb/>
ease after the mosquito bite varies from<lb/>
two to six days.</item>
<item>(8.) Yellow fever is not conveyed by the<lb/>
discharges of the patient.</item>
<item>(9.) A house is only infected with yellow<lb/>
fever when contaminated mosquitoes are<lb/>
present within its walls.</item>
<item>(10.) Yellow fever can be controlled by<lb/>
destruction of mosquitoes and protection<lb/>
of the sick from being bitten.</item>
