<salute>Dear Colonel Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thanks much for your note. I am<lb/>
delighted to see your editorial on the biography of<lb/>
Gorgas. I think you are quite right in coming to the<lb/>
defence of Reed. As a matter of fact, I was quite<lb/>
disappointed in the biography. But Heaven help me,<lb/>
having perpetrated one myself, I have compassion on<lb/>
biographers in general. The difference in point of<lb/>
view is that Mrs. Gorgas and Hendrick in combination<lb/>
have tried to make an ideal person out of their hero<lb/>
whereas I have merely tried to let Osler show what<lb/>
he was like by permitting the story to unravel itself.<lb/>
The fault in my method which the reviewers may justly<lb/>
criticize, and severely, is that I have taken too many<lb/>
pages to do this and few people will have the patience<lb/>
to read the story through to the end, or even to turn<lb/>
the pages.</p>
<p>I shall be very much interested to see how the two<lb/>
books sell, for they have come out at about the same<lb/>
time. The Osler volumes, being printed in England, are<lb/>
undoubtedly expensive over here, and the Oxford Press<lb/>
have not utilized or had at their command the ordinary<lb/>
medium of advertising such as Doubleday Page &amp; Co. have<lb/>
access to. It would be interesting to know at the end *<lb/>
of six months something about the comparison of the *<lb/>
sales, for after all the success must be measured by *<lb/>
readers rather than by reviewers.</p>
<p>Cushing's Osler was all sold out and a new printing was necessary<lb/>
The Gorgas-Hendrick biography was so widely condemned that it failed to sell<lb/>
There was no reprint of it &amp; the copyright was sold- It is now rarely <unclear>seen</unclear><lb/>
a <unclear>case reprint later (B)</unclear></p>
<p>But I didn't set out to write you about the Osler<lb/>
but merely to commend you on your admirable and timely<lb/>
editorial.</p>
<p>With great regards, I am as always</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Harvey Cushing</signed>

P.S. I wish to the dickens I had recalled that your<lb/>
office was in the Museum Building. Otherwise I would<lb/>
have looked in on you a few weeks ago when I was in<lb/>
Washington at the time of the Congress. I called<lb/>
on the General, but he was out at lunch; and when in<lb/>
the Library I was got hooked by the nose and spent<lb/>
the morning looking at some old books.<lb/>
