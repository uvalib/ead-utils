<salute>Dear Mother:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am writing by a candle in spite<lb/>
of the magnificence depicted above - to be sure a &ldquo;<unclear>facts</unclear><lb/>
<unclear>close</unclear> candell parafina Americana&rdquo; as I am infor-<lb/>
med. So I will not write much,</p>
<p>I tried to get to North River from Washington, &amp; indeed had<lb/>
my plans laid to go there Sunday - reaching you about mid-<lb/>
night, but had to leave for this place that day. And<lb/>
it was well I did so, &amp; had been very much<lb/>
better had I left 3 days earlier as a decidedly<lb/>
annoying complication has arisen by an assumption<lb/>
of some of my functions by Gen'l Ludlow, just before<lb/>
I arrived. It will come out all straight for me but<lb/>
I wish well it had been avoidable.</p>
<p>I wished much to see you. I hoped I could have stayed to<lb/>
the <unclear>downtrain</unclear> Wednesday, nearly three days.<lb/>
Well I am here for how long I cannot say. Until I<lb/>
complete the organization of the Quarantine &amp; Maritime<lb/>
sanitation in this Country. The work is hard &amp; doubt-<lb/>
ful, not only against the malign forces of nature - but the<lb/>
Jealousies: vanities &amp; general contrariness of men,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00724002"/>

&amp; of all things I like peace: Old Commodore Crom-<lb/>
well, Captain of the Party is the only man I have<lb/>
seen who is working without thought of himself.</p>
<p>Henry was fairly well- convalescent from Grippe - when<lb/>
I left N. O., on tomorrow <add>fortnight</add> <del>week</del>, Laura was not eating<lb/>
enough, but had not been sick. Ned, was well &amp;<lb/>
was to take his first lesson in the violin. Laura Sr. was<lb/>
well. She had a dreadful spell on her arrival at N. O.<lb/>
but had been very well for some time.</p>
<p>I spent one night Saturday - at Ned's house &amp; saw<lb/>
Helen &amp; Sylvia- I also waited there one night with<lb/>
Henry Carter a long time &amp; saw him for a little<lb/>
while, I went also to see Jim Baylor - of Caroline<lb/>
- whom I used to know &amp; like so well at the University.<lb/>
Now I am glad I had yellow fever, I would be here any-<lb/>
way &amp; otherwise I would be afraid. One has it but once.<lb/>
My garden in N. O. was just beginning to be interesting.<lb/>
Dear love to all at North River &amp; I judge that I will<lb/>
see you &amp; Laura &amp; the children there next <del>fall</del><add>summer</add>.</p>
<p>Again dear love, &amp; God bless you</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your Affec'ate son</salute>
<signed>H. R. Carter</signed>.
I am thinking how much work, good work much of it,<lb/>
your sons have done in the world. It is a privilege to<lb/>
have been able "to serve ones generation by the grace of God.<lb/>
