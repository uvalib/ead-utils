<salute>My dear Col. <unclear>Hench</unclear></salute>
</opener>
<p>Mrs Kean and I have been away<lb/>
on a charming visit to my old comrade<lb/>
<add>Col. <unclear>Berl</unclear></add> of World War I and on my return I find<lb/>
an <unclear>armful</unclear> of mail including your interest-<lb/>
ing letter of June 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> with its inclosures<lb/>
Also the excellent photographs of Major<lb/>
Walter Reed's diplomas- Several of the signa-<lb/>
tures on his M. D. from the University of Va.<lb/>
were the same as on mine fifteen years<lb/>
later, notably Dr. John Staige Davis in Prac<lb/>
tice of Medicine and Dr- James C. Cabell<lb/>
<add>in Surgery</add>. The picture of the Army Medical Museum<lb/>
looks a little drawn out to the left- This is<lb/>
evidently the South front and Reeds office<lb/>
was on the S. E. Corner on the second floor- That<lb/>
is when he became Librarian- Before that he was at the Army Med School on La. Avenue-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06413069"/>

Gen. Truby has been in Virginia for a couple<lb/>
of weeks but not near Washington. He has<lb/>
now come to Washington and is at Walter<lb/>
Reed Hospital for a check over- This will<lb/>
give him a convenient base to run around<lb/>
and see his friends and he telephoned<lb/>
today that he and Mrs. Truby would<lb/>
come to see us tomorrow afternoon.<lb/>
Gen Lawrence Reed will bring them in-<lb/>
He has planned to go to the War Col-<lb/>
lege (old Wash. Bks. to see if he can<lb/>
locate the room in which Walter<lb/>
Reed died. He will get the new Surg,<lb/>
Gen. to send him down that he will<lb/>
have due attention- I will see them<lb/>
before I mail this letter and so<lb/>
will add anything of interest that<lb/>
he may tell me in a P. S..</p>
<closer>
<seg>
P. S. They came but later than we expected<lb/>
them as they went first to see the Irelands<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06413070"/>
3<lb/>
and did not get here until 5.15 and<lb/>
Truby had to report back to the Hospital<lb/>
at 6, pm- I found him looking very<lb/>
well, tho. he drags his left leg a little-<lb/>
But he got a good report from the Hospital<lb/>
and has a blood pressure of 170 over 96<lb/>
which they told him was very good for<lb/>
his age. It is lower than mine which<lb/>
was 180 over 115 to 120 when Dr. <unclear>Healy</unclear><lb/>
came to see me last Tuesday and<lb/>
gave me my discharge as a patient.<lb/>
He is a fine young man and we are all<lb/>
pleased with him-<lb/>
It seems to me that you have things well<lb/>
started for the preservation of the building<lb/>
at Camp Lazear- It is a lucky accident<lb/>
that Dr. Finlay should have made some of<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06413071"/>
4<lb/>
Ac<lb/>
k<lb/>
his experiments at Finca Son Jos&eacute; as it<lb/>
connects him with that locality in addi-<lb/>
tion to the fact that Dr Finlay visited<lb/>
Camp Lazear repeatedly to verify the diag-<lb/>
noses of Reed's experimental cases-<lb/>
I have been reading his experimental<lb/>
cases and am quite impressed with<lb/>
that of Rev. E. <unclear>Urra</unclear> S. J which he treated<lb/>
at the pleasure <unclear>From</unclear> &lsquo;La Asuncion&rsquo; which<lb/>
I take to be the same as Finca San Jose<lb/>
in &ldquo;Los Quemados&rdquo;- I am very curious<lb/>
to know what your conclusion are as<lb/>
to his claim that the limitations of<lb/>
the Reed Board as to the limit of infection<lb/>
power of the patient on the mosquito and<lb/>
of the incubation period in men are too rigid-<lb/>
His discussion of the work of the Board in his sons<lb/>
book are very interesting- <unclear></unclear> is waiting<lb/>
Affectionately yours<lb/>
J. R. Kean<lb/>
