<salute>My precious Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I had al-<lb/>
ready begun a letter, this morning,<lb/>
and had written to the bottom of<lb/>
the fifth page, but upon the ar-<lb/>
rival of your letter, dated Dec.<lb/>
6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, I concluded to toss that one<lb/>
aside and begin anew. Not that<lb/>
I had written anything that I<lb/>
would not have you read, (for<lb/>
it was as affectionate as I<lb/>
could well make it) but simply<lb/>
because I am <add>of</add> opinion that I can<lb/>
write one more appropriate,<lb/>
under the present circumstan-<lb/>
ces. I scarcely know how to<lb/>
commence it, however, since so<lb/>
many conflicting <add>ideas</add> flood my mind<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01666002"/>
that I hardly feel myself able to reduce them to<lb/>
an intelligent narrative. When, 3 weeks ago, or more,<lb/>
you wrote that you had received a letter from one,<lb/>
whose name I will not mention, and that you felt it<lb/>
your duty to reply, lest his sensibilities should be<lb/>
aggrieved, you little thought, my darling E. that you<lb/>
were writing words that would sink deeply into<lb/>
my heart, and that <add>those words</add> <del>they</del> would be misconstrued to<lb/>
the extent which you say they have been. And<lb/>
I, in answering your letter, certainly did not sup-<lb/>
pose that I was inflicting &ldquo;more wounds tha<del>t</del>n<lb/>
you once thought you would <add>ever</add> submit to from<lb/>
any gentleman.&rdquo; That sentence, my darling, I<lb/>
have read, over &amp; over again, and, believe me when<lb/>
I tell you that the knowledge of the fact that I<lb/>
have so &ldquo;wounded&rdquo; you has caused me the deep-<lb/>
est pain &amp; contrition of heart; albeit you sup-<lb/>
posed that it would be a &ldquo;<hi>gratification</hi>&rdquo; to me to be<lb/>
made cognizant of the fact. This, of course, my darling<lb/>
Emilie, was not intended to be &ldquo;cutting.&rdquo; <add>Did</add> You believe<lb/>
what you said; that it would be a &ldquo;gratification&rdquo; to<lb/>
me? You also add; &ldquo;I do not see how after<lb/>
relating to you how much your letter <del>could</del><lb/>
had grieved me, you could repeat your re-<lb/>
proaches, even with redoubled energy&rdquo;! This<lb/>
sentence, also, bears upon its face the evidence<lb/>
that you <hi>felt</hi> and <hi>meant</hi> what you wrote.<lb/>
And yet, my darling, you will pardon me, if I beg<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01666003"/>
leave to differ with you, <del>and</del> however reluct-<lb/>
antly I may do so. &ldquo;I derive no pleasure from<lb/>
the censure that you are <hi>continually</hi> heaping<lb/>
upon me.&rdquo; Of course, my darling, you are aware<lb/>
of the force of that sentence. &ldquo;I am not ac-<lb/>
customed to harsh words&rdquo;:- the inference being<lb/>
that I am <add>ac</add>customed to use them towards you.<lb/>
&ldquo;I cannot take your reproofs, when I am<lb/>
innocent.&rdquo; &ldquo;Surely, if my home is not with<lb/>
you, you need not concern yourself how<lb/>
far I go from home.&rdquo; Were none of these<lb/>
words, my darling, meant to be &ldquo;cutting&rdquo;? Read<lb/>
them over again, &amp; see if you need ask, &ldquo;where<lb/>
<hi>is</hi> my Independence&rdquo;? If you have none<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01666004"/>
with you, at present, my darling, it is because<lb/>
you enclosed it <hi>all</hi> in your letter of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>,<lb/>
or else my knowledge of the definition of the<lb/>
word is very deficient. Indeed, although my<lb/>
letter was written in a plain style, I did<lb/>
not intend, my darling little Sweet-heart, to<lb/>
wound you at all. I attempted, as briefly &amp;<lb/>
correctly as I could, to give you an expression<lb/>
of my opinion of the subject then under dis-<lb/>
cussion. A subject which, looking at in the light<lb/>
that I then did, seemed to be of some im-<lb/>
portance, but which, to you, seemed &ldquo;trivial&rdquo;.<lb/>
Had I not loved you dearly, I should have<lb/>
never noticed the matter, &amp; had I entertained<lb/>
the remotest idea of breaking our engage-<lb/>
ment, I would have quietly permitted you to<lb/>
have <del>com</del> written to the unknown gentleman,<lb/>
&amp; upon your acknowledgement of the same, asked<lb/>
for a release. I little imagined <add>that</add> what I had<lb/>
intended as an expression of my affection would<lb/>
be construed into &ldquo;words of reproach.&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi>con-<lb/>
tinual</hi> reproach&rdquo;. But so it has been inter-<lb/>
preted, and upon my head I take all the<lb/>
blame. Would to God that the last month<lb/>
of my life could be blotted from memory!<lb/>
Oh! my darling, my precious Emilie, if I could<lb/>
really bring myself to the belief, that you<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01666005"/>
really intended to say that I am &ldquo;heaping cen-<lb/>
sure upon you <hi>continually</hi>,&rdquo; this letter<lb/>
would bear to you the request to release me<lb/>
from all claims, for Heaven knows, if thus you<lb/>
think, I could never be brave enough to look<lb/>
you in the countenance! Oh! my God! how<lb/>
little understood is my heart! and will I not<lb/>
go down to my last resting-spot still<lb/>
misunderstood? Were I but convinced that<lb/>
you believed that I had intentionally censured<lb/>
you &amp; that continually, I should be the<lb/>
most miserable man that ever breathed!<lb/>
As God is my Maker, &amp; as I expect to be<lb/>
judged, at the last Day, for my words, I<lb/>
declare that it was not my intention to<lb/>
grieve you, my darling, &amp; that what I wrote<lb/>
concerning your living in Baltimore &amp; the suc-<lb/>
ceeding sentences, was meant as the merest<lb/>
<hi>fun</hi>! You, my darling, have written<lb/>
much in Irony, &amp; have been much surprised<lb/>
whenever I misunderstood your words.<lb/>
Yet when I made use of <add>it</add>, this time, I did<lb/>
not think that you would seize upon<lb/>
it as the weapon with which to deal<lb/>
your blows! &ldquo;You need not concern your-<lb/>
self how far I go from home&rdquo;! Oh! Yes!<lb/>
my darling, I should always feel an in-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01666006"/>
terest in you and your whereabouts. I don't<lb/>
love one moment &amp; forget the next-and I had<lb/>
hoped that you would not object to my fol-<lb/>
lowing your course with a friendly eye, un-<lb/>
til you gave me unmistakably to under-<lb/>
stand that I &ldquo;need not concern myself.&rdquo;<lb/>
You have often expressed yourself as<lb/>
wonder<add>ing</add><del>ed</del> whether &ldquo;the Future will be simelar&rdquo;?<lb/>
I am sorry to see this, my darling, for you<lb/>
thereby strongly express a doubt in my<lb/>
future love and kindness. 'Tis strange<lb/>
that I have had no doubts on this point,<lb/>
simply because, I know that I could live<lb/>
happily with one who would return my<lb/>
love. I would not mislead you on this<lb/>
point, my darling Emilie. You must satisfy<lb/>
yourself that I will love &amp; protect you, be-<lb/>
fore you give yourself into my hands.<lb/>
I want no compulsion, my darling. Your<lb/>
act must be as free as the breath you <add>draw</add>!<lb/>
Although, my only happiness in life is your<lb/>
love, yet I had rather go through life<lb/>
alone and unknown than to marry a lady<lb/>
who had no confidence in my love. Oh! how<lb/>
it grieves me when I think that I have<lb/>
given you<del>r</del> cause to doubt me already!<lb/>
Well, Emilie darling, all that I can do is to<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01666007"/>
beg that you will forgive me and to try <del>and</del><lb/>
to forget the Past. Send back the letters<lb/>
which you would have me recall, that I may<lb/>
destroy <add>them</add>. I think our recent lesson should<lb/>
teach us to beware of writing what we<lb/>
do not mean- I promise faithfully to avoid<lb/>
everything that can possibly lead to any<lb/>
misunderstanding- I acknowledge that I am<lb/>
too quick in forming my opinions, and will<lb/>
endeavor to restrain myself in this re-<lb/>
spect. I will confide in you wholly,<lb/>
&amp; under no circumstances will I<lb/>
distrust you. May I hope that the same<lb/>
will be accorded me? Oh! on my knee<lb/>
to-night, I will pray that I may be forgiven<lb/>
for the wrong that I have done you- and<lb/>
that you may forget it- And <add>as</add> you<del>r</del> lay<lb/>
your pure, sweet cheek upon your<lb/>
pillow, tonight, know that there is one<lb/>
who loves you more dearly than all<lb/>
else in this world!</p>
<closer>
<salute>Good-night, my own darling,<lb/>
and believe me, as ever, your <hi>fond</hi><lb/>
and <hi>repentant</hi></salute>
