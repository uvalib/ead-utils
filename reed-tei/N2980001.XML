<p>Convincing proof of President<lb/>
Taft's remarkable statement can<lb/>
best be given by a brief summary of<lb/>
some of the work accomplished by<lb/>
the physicians to whom he paid his<lb/>
tribute:</p>
<p>Yellow Fever--The primary ob-<lb/>
ject of the war with Spain was the<lb/>
liberation of Cuba from Spanish dom-<lb/>
ination, but at the same time the<lb/>
United States hoped to accomplish a<lb/>
good deal in improving the sanitary<lb/>
condition of the island. Yellow fever<lb/>
had been continuously present in<lb/>
Havana since 1762. There had been<lb/>
numerous epidemics before 1762,<lb/>
yellow fever being introduced there<lb/>
as early as 1720. Between 1702 and<lb/>
1878 yellow fever appeared in the<lb/>
United States, according to Keating,<lb/>
one hundred and twelve times, reach-<lb/>
ing as far North as Nantucket Isl-<lb/>
and, Mass., where 259 persons died<lb/>
of it in 1763. Epidemics were fre-<lb/>
quent in New York and Philadelphia.<lb/>
In 1793 there were 4,041 deaths in<lb/>
Philadelphia, which had a population<lb/>
of 40,144. New York during earlier and<lb/>
later invasions has had 3,454 deaths.<lb/>
Bellevue Hospital was originally<lb/>
planned as a yellow fever hospital.</p>
<p>The most frequent and destructive<lb/>
epidemics were in the Southern States.<lb/>
It is estimated that the epidemic of<lb/>
1878 cost this country $100,000,000 in<lb/>
addition to lives lost. In Memphis<lb/>
there were 18,500 cases with 5,000<lb/>
deaths. In New Orleans and in some<lb/>
other Southern cities yellow fever was<lb/>
epidemic the following years since<lb/>
1878: 1879, 1880, 1883, 1889, 1897, 1898,<lb/>
1899 and 1905. According to the best<lb/>
figures obtainable there must have been<lb/>
500,000 cases of yellow fever in the<lb/>
United States from 1793 to 1900, with a<lb/>
mortality of 100,000.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes Spread Yellow Jack.</p>
<p>Havana was the city from which the<lb/>
United States was most frequently in-<lb/>
fected. When the Americans took pos-<lb/>
session in 1899, the work of sanitation<lb/>
was at once started. Major (now Colo-<lb/>
nel) Gorgas of the Medical Corps of the<lb/>
Army was in charge. Cases soon began<lb/>
to appear in the army and when immi-<lb/>
grants began to come in in large num-<lb/>
bers yellow fever there became preva-<lb/>
 lent. One-third of the officers on the<lb/>
staff of Gen. Leonard Wood died of yel-<lb/>
low fever. In the summer of 19<unclear>00</unclear> the</p>

<p>Yellow Fever Commission of the United<lb/>
States Army was organized, consisting<lb/>
of the following medical officers of the<lb/>
United States Army: Major Walter<lb/>
Reed, Dr. James Carroll, Dr. Jesse W.<lb/>
Lazear and Dr. Aristides Agramonte.<lb/>
By a series of well planned and scien-<lb/>
tifically conducted experiments this<lb/>
commission demonstrated to the world<lb/>
that yellow fever is transmitted from<lb/>
one person to another only by a certain<lb/>
species of mosquito, and cannot be<lb/>
transmitted in any other way. Major<lb/>
Gorgas at once began working along<lb/>
the lines outlined by the commission:<lb/>
First, the destruction of all mosqui-<lb/>
toes, and especially mosquitoes in the<lb/>
vicinity of yellow fever patients; sec-<lb/>
ond, the protection of yellow fever<lb/>
patients from the mosquitoes, and<lb/>
third, the protection of non-immune<lb/>
subjects from mosquitoes.</p>
<p>This work was started in February,<lb/>
1901, and after September, 1901, no more<lb/>
cases occurred in Havana or Cuba until<lb/>
1905, when it was again banished by the<lb/>
army physicians during the second in-<lb/>
tervention. Only once since 1899 has yel-<lb/>
low fever gained a foothold in the United<lb/>
States, in 1905, when it was wiped out<lb/>
of New Orleans and vicinity by Dr.<lb/>
White of the Public Health and Marine<lb/>
Hospital Service.</p>
<p>Discovery of Hook-Worm.</p>
<p>Hook-Worm.--Capt. (now Major) Bai-<lb/>
ley K. Ashford, Medical Corps, U. S.<lb/>
Army, demonstrated to the world that<lb/>
the tropical anaemia so prevalent in<lb/>
Porto Rico was caused by a small in-<lb/>
testinal worm known as the hook-worm.<lb/>
In 1899 Dr. Ashford established a hos-<lb/>
pital there for hurricane victims. Fully<lb/>
three-fourths were suffering from an-<lb/>
aemia, due to hook-worm. A commis-<lb/>
sion was appointed consisting of Dr.<lb/>
Ashford, Dr. W. W. King, U. S. Pub-<lb/>
lic Health and Marine Hospital Service,<lb/>
and Dr. Pedro Gutierrez, health officer<lb/>
at Bayamon. About 300,000 cases were<lb/>
treated, of whom over 40 per cent. were<lb/>
entirely cured and the remainder re-<lb/>
lieved. The average death-rate in the<lb/>
island for the first five years of the<lb/>
work was 33.48 per 1,000, and for the last<lb/>
five years 23.33 per 1,000.</p>
<p>Sanitation of Panama Canal.--The<lb/>
French failed to complete the Panama<lb/>
Canal because of the very high mortality<lb/>
among employees from yellow fever and<lb/>
malaria. They could not live or work<lb/>
there. When the Americans went there<lb/>
Col. Gorgas went with them, and the<lb/>
following extract from an article by Dr.<lb/>
William Osler relates the result:</p>
<p>Dr. Osler on Panama Sanitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The digging of the Panama Canal<lb/>
was acknowledged to be a question of<lb/>
the health of the workers. For four cen-<lb/>
turies the Isthmus had been a white<lb/>
man's grave, and at one time during<lb/>
French control of the Canal the mor-<lb/>
tality reached 170 per 1,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Month by month I get the reports,<lb/>
which form by far the most interesting<lb/>
sanitary reading of the present day. Of<lb/>
more than 54,000 employees (about 13,000<lb/>
of whom are white) the death rate per<lb/>
1,000 for March was 8.91, a lower per-<lb/>
centage, I believe, than in any city in<lb/>
the United Kingdom and very much<lb/>
lower than in any city in the United<lb/>
States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Work of Sanitation During the<lb/>
Second Intervention in Cuba.--When the<lb/>
American army was withdrawn from<lb/>
Cuba May 20, 1902, together with the<lb/>
sanitary chiefs and the medical officers<lb/>
of the army, a relapse of sanitary work<lb/>
throughout the island occurred. Havana<lb/>
became infected in 1905 with yellow<lb/>
fever from New Orleans. In a short<lb/>
time yellow fever was widespread<lb/>
throughout the island and remained so<lb/>
until the second intervention. Then,<lb/>
under the able direction of Major (now<lb/>
Colonel) Kean of the Army Medical<lb/>
Corps, sanitary matters were again<lb/>
regulated and yellow fever once more<lb/>
put to flight. Major Kean then recog-<lb/>
nized that to prevent such a recurrence<lb/>
there must be a national health depart-<lb/>
ment. He prepared the sanitary laws<lb/>
of Cuba now in force, and as long as<lb/>
they are observed Cuba can never re-<lb/>
lapse into its former deplorable sani-<lb/>
tary condition.</p>
<p>Small-Pox--By compulsory vaccina-<lb/>
tion of the inhabitants of Porto Rico,<lb/>
Cuba and the Philippines by the army<lb/>
medical officers small-pox has been prac-<lb/>
tically wiped out. Not a single death<lb/>
has occurred from small-pox in Porto<lb/>
Rico since the civil government was es-<lb/>
tablished; the occurrence is much less<lb/>
frequent in Cuba than in the United<lb/>
States, and the disease occurs infre-<lb/>
quently among the Filipinos.</p>
<p>President Taft, as Governor of the<lb/>
Philippines, established a Department<lb/>
of Public Health on a scale to cope<lb/>
successfully with the devasting epi-<lb/>
demics of plague and cholera which had<lb/>
marked the history of those islands.<lb/>
He also established the laboratories of<lb/>
the Bureau of Science at Manila, which<lb/>
have assisted greatly in the study of<lb/>
tropical diseases. He also established<lb/>
a leper colony at Culion which promises<lb/>
to be the means of stamping out this<lb/>
terrible disease. The civil hospital in<lb/>
Manila is another monument to Gov.<lb/>
Taft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;SPANISH WAR AIDED<lb/>
MEDICAL RESEARCH.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">&ldquo;Brought New Problems Which<lb/>
Army Doctors Solved,&rdquo;<lb/>
Says Dr. Siglar</hi>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When President Taft told of discov-<lb/>
eries concerning tropical diseases made<lb/>
by American physicians since the Span-<lb/>
ish war he placed his finger on a signifi-<lb/>
cant fact,&rdquo; said Dr. Henry Burr Siglar,<lb/>
No. 24 State street, Manhattan, yester-<lb/>
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No concentrated thought had been<lb/>
paid to many mysterious diseases of the<lb/>
<unclear>tropics. The Spanish war changed all</unclear><lb/>
this. Yellow fever in Cuba, the hook<lb/>
worm in Porto Rico, leprosy in the Phil-<lb/>
ippines and other dread complaints be-<lb/>
came our heritage. Immediately we<lb/>
had taken Cuba we were face to face<lb/>
with the problem of cleansing it. Not<lb/>
only was sanitation enforced, but the<lb/>
army physicians gave battle to the<lb/>
ancient plague of yellow fever in its own<lb/>
lair, and the theory that the fever<lb/>
originated from the bite of a certain<lb/>
kind of mosquito was confirmed. Once<lb/>
having been settled for all time, the<lb/>
remedy for the epidemics that had swept<lb/>
the island was comparatively plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Walter Reed, a surgeon in the<lb/>
United States Army, and others demon-<lb/>
strated the theory at the risk of their<lb/>
lives. Dr. Reed built a little, ill-venti-<lb/>
lated frame house in Cuba near the vil-<lb/>
lage of Quemados, used bed clothing<lb/>
from Havana hospitals where yellow<lb/>
fever patients had died, and his five<lb/>
companions, enlisted men, wore night-<lb/>
clothes in which patients had expired.<lb/>
Everything was done to make yellow<lb/>
fever probable, with one exception--wire<lb/>
screens were put in the windows, through<lb/>
which no mosquitoes could enter. None<lb/>
of these heroes contracted fever. Then<lb/>
another house was built in two sections.<lb/>
One was screened, the other was not.<lb/>
Seven men lived in each section for<lb/>
seven weeks. Of <unclear>tt</unclear>hose in the screened<lb/>
section none became ill, but five of those<lb/>
in the unscreened section came down<lb/>
with the disease. It was a complete<lb/>
demonstration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon our shoulders had been placed<lb/>
a burden that older people had tired of<lb/>
and had borne indifferently. The army<lb/>
medical men did their best. Rich men<lb/>
saw the necessity of great and well en-<lb/>
dowed laboratories where students free<lb/>
from the cares of making a living could<lb/>
fight the battle against disease success-<lb/>
fully. Such institutions as the Rocke-<lb/>
feller Institute followed. Not only our<lb/>
own diseases were taken up, but also<lb/>
those of our colonies. The most success-<lb/>
ful feat there has been the discovery<lb/>
of the cerebro-spinal meningitis serum,<lb/>
which has reduced the mortality from<lb/>
per cent. in this disease.&rdquo;</p>
