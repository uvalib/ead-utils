<salute>My Dear Doctor Kelly:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just returned from a long western trip,<lb/>
and find the complimentary copy of your admirable little book entitled<lb/>
&ldquo;Walter Reed and Yellow Fever.&rdquo; I have glanced over it, and promise<lb/>
myself the pleasure of a most careful reading in the near future.<lb/>
It was very kind of you to have this book sent to me. I should<lb/>
certainly have purchased it otherwise. I congratulate you on having<lb/>
done an excellent and most careful piece of work, and I am glad that<lb/>
Doctor Reed had so able and so enthusiastic a biographer. Very few<lb/>
people -- possibly none outside of the medical profession -- are in po-<lb/>
sition to appreciate the tremenduous effects of Doctor Reed's work and<lb/>
the careful manner in which it was performed, and the genius of the<lb/>
man himself, better than I. As you may not know, I was closely in<lb/>
touch with the work from its very conception. Doctor Lazear called<lb/>
on me and talked mosquitoes with me before he went to Cuba. Reed and<lb/>
Carroll came frequently to my office and studied mosquitoes -- one after-<lb/>
noon Coquillett and I have them regular class work on the characters<lb/>
used in distinguishing the different species. After Reed achieved<lb/>
his first results he wrote me a long letter, which I shall always pre-<lb/>
serve, in which he described his work and in which his enthusiasm<lb/>
glowed. One of his expressions I remember was &ldquo;And now, thanks to<lb/>
Howard and kerosene, we have yellow fever under control.&rdquo; I shall<lb/>
always think, moreover, with peculiar gratification that it was my<lb/>
story of Reed and his work at that dinner at Graham Bell's that start-<lb/>
ed the resolution for the Reed memorial. It was an interesting and<lb/>
eventful dinner. Some of the best men of this country were there, and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02850002"/>
my friend, James Fletcher, from Canada. Although it was a large din-<lb/>
ner, as always happens at Doctor Bell's, the conversation after dinner<lb/>
was directed by him into single channels, and among other people of<lb/>
whom he asked questions, he asked me to tell the story of Reed. I<lb/>
have always hoped that it was the enthusiastic way in which I stated<lb/>
the subject that started the strong feeling among those present, most<lb/>
of whom knew only the newspaper comments.</p>
<p>Reed was a great man, and a fine man, and one of the most de-<lb/>
lightful, sincere and clean personalities I ever met.</p>
<p>With renewed thanks.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
