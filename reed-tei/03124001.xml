<salute>My dear Miss Mallock:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just returned from New York, where I had a confer-<lb/>
ence with Dr. Armstrong and Miss Franklin of the Metropolitan<lb/>
Life Insurance Co. As you doubtless know they are preparing a<lb/>
film strip to accompany the pamphlet you wrote for them on Wal-<lb/>
ter Reed. At Mrs. Reed's suggestion I left with them all the<lb/>
pictures she sent me, some of which they are to use.</p>
<p>While in the City I went to the Seripps-Howard Newspaper<lb/>
Syndicate. They had asked me to tell them of the work we have<lb/>
been carrying on for Kissinger, and they are very eager to is-<lb/>
sue a series of articles with the aim of bringing about that<lb/>
long-deferred Congressional action. Their representative, Miss<lb/>
Saunders will prepare the articles as soon as I am ready.</p>
<p>In the meantime I am writing up a lecture on &ldquo;The Conquest<lb/>
of Yellow Fever&rdquo; to accompany sets of lantern slides which we<lb/>
hope will be rather widely used here<del>s</del> in the City Schools (under<lb/>
the direction of the Museum of Natural History), and on the<lb/>
Pacific Coast (under Dr. Hunter's direction. As soon as this<lb/>
lecture is completed I plan to talk with the Metropolitan peo-<lb/>
ple and with Miss Saunders. I shall place at their disposal any<lb/>
pictures and other material in my possession, unless you think<lb/>
that would interfere with your plans for the book you are to<lb/>
write. It had seemed to me that all four of these lines of<lb/>
activity are rather independent of each other, and could be<lb/>
made mutually helpful.</p>
<p>I am wondering, therefore, if it would be convenient for<lb/>
you to come to the Metropolitan Building about the middle of<lb/>
this month. I am to have there my set of lantern slides, and<lb/>
they have a lantern. Would you favor the plan of asking Miss<lb/>
Saunders and Miss Franklin to join us, or would it be better<lb/>
for me to see you first? My one desire now is to get that<lb/>
pension bill through Congress early in December.</p>
<p>Did I write you of the very interesting series of letters<lb/>
I have been getting from Margaret Deland (author of &ldquo;Old Chester<lb/>
Tales&rdquo;? She is deeply interested in our campaign. She has invi-<lb/>
ed Mrs. Peabody and me to her home to discuss ways and means.</p>

<salute>Cordially yours,</salute>
