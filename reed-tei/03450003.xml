<salute>My dear <hi>Hutch</hi>:</salute>
</opener>
<p>We shall be delighted to have Mr. and Mrs. Swartz come here for a<lb/>
general examination. I have phoned the Kahler for a medium priced room with<lb/>
twin beds and bath beginning Tuesday morning, February 22. I have made a<lb/>
definite appointment at the Clinic for them and would be glad if they would<lb/>
phone me upon their arrival at the hotel. They can phone me at home, and if<lb/>
I am not at home, phone the Clinic. I shall be glad to meet them and get<lb/>
them started that morning. I am taking the liberty of writing them a note.<lb/>
Two days will hurry things considerably, but we can hurry things up by having<lb/>
them report without breakfast, etc. I am having both of them registered in<lb/>
Dr. Logan's section, and I also will be on the lookout for them. Since my<lb/>
own section is devoted to special work I thought it best to have them regis-<lb/>
tered in a general section although I will want to see that they get along<lb/>
as fast as possible. It might be best for them to plan to stay three or<lb/>
four days rather than two.</p>
<p>As far as expense is concerned, that is difficult to say. In confidence,<lb/>
it costs the Clinic about forty dollars for each patient that comes in the<lb/>
front door, so that a hundred dollar charge which is the maximum average for<lb/>
a man of ordinary means to have a very thorough examination doesn't reap very<lb/>
many proceeds when you realize how many men are apt to see him, how many labora-<lb/>
tory tests there are, etc., but I am sure that they will be satisfied with the<lb/>
charge, whatever it is. He doesn't have to worry about paying it all when<lb/>
he leaves if he doesn't want to. He can pay something down and pay the rest<lb/>
month by month. Dr. Logan and I will make sure that he is satisfied.</p>
<p>Why can't you come out either with them or preferably before them?<lb/>
The room is waiting for you at the house unless Mother happens to arrive sooner<lb/>
than we expect, in which case I will share part of my bed with you, if you<lb/>
promise not to look over my shoulder at my wife. How about meeting us in New<lb/>
York as I wrote you?</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that Lord Dawson can't come. Would there be any advantage<lb/>
in my seeing him? You have my other letter by now. I agree that rather than<lb/>
have the affair go off half right it would be better to wait and have it go<lb/>
off the way you want it.</p>
