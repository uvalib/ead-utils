<salute>Dear Jack:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of October 19th. just received.</p>
<p>(1): You are correct in assuming that B&eacute;ranger-F&eacute;raud (Trait&eacute;<lb/>
th&eacute;orique et clinique...(1890) p. 30, in citing Du Tertre <hi>re</hi> epidemic<lb/>
St. Lucia (1665) gives no specific reference by volume or page, and<lb/>
cites no authority other than Du Tertre. I hope that Miss Brown and<lb/>
I can, <hi>eventually</hi>, get some satisfactory data on this reference, but,<lb/>
of course, had not tried to <add>do so</add> up to the <unclear>[unclear]</unclear> quite recent time when I got<lb/>
vol.iii of du Tertre. Prior to seeing his text, I had, of course,<lb/>
expected to get a definite and satisfactory reference from him. Since,<lb/>
however, you say that this reference can be disregarded if necessary,<lb/>
I shall continue to concentrate on things more essential.</p>
<p>(2) By the way, <add>(and merely as a matter of curiosity)</add> <hi>re</hi> Lassis (ii. p. 57) :La Roche doesn't seem to<lb/>
greatly admire him, stating (vol.ii. p. 70) &ldquo;Especially, am I not<lb/>
prepared to admit on so equivocal an authority as Lassis,&rdquo; (who did<lb/>
not share La Roche's views on contagion from what follows<add>)</add>. LaRoche<lb/>
apparently did not quote Lassis <hi>re</hi> epidemic Paris (1822), although he<lb/>
gives his &ldquo;Calamit&eacute;s&rdquo;... (quoted by Augustin for this epidemic) in his<lb/>
bibliography. As I wrote you before, none of Lassis' publications (I<lb/>
only know of two, (ch. La Roche) are listed at any Library here.</p>
<p>(3) I am enclosing tentative library card <hi>re</hi> Book of the Jew, <unclear><add><hi>(iii.i.p. 60)</hi></add></unclear><lb/>
for which you have orange or pink bibliographic card. We got the ref-<lb/>
erence by a fortunate accident, while looking up something else--which<lb/>
we didn't get! <hi>Re</hi> this Book of the Jew, it <del>can</del> <add>could</add> only be seen by our<lb/>
going to Boston or Philadelphia. Do you think it is important enough<lb/>
for me to write <del>both places</del> to one of these places and ask for a trans-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0321024"/>
-2-<lb/>
transcription of the passage, or better yet, a photostat, containing<lb/>
the prescription for &ldquo;xekik&rdquo;--&ldquo;blood-vomit?&rdquo; Of course, its just a<lb/>
medical and literary curio, but it <hi>is</hi> <add>a curio.</add></p>
<p>Miss Brown and I are working &ldquo;very hard and very long,&rdquo; as there<lb/>
is still quite a lot to do at this end of the line. She's spending<lb/>
the night with me as, to-morrow being Sunday, we can not only work<lb/>
this evening, but get an early start in the morning. Lord! what a<lb/>
<hi>mass</hi> of material Father read in connection with the book<add>!</add>--ever so much<lb/>
more than we've been over, indeed, as we are only giving a bibliography<lb/>
of author's mentioned in his work, and Father read many other books<lb/>
which are not directly cited, indeed, took careful notes on some of<lb/>
them.</p>
<p>Sunday, October 21, 1928.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the biographic data, <hi>re</hi> Father, received<lb/>
by special delivery last night. As you say, it can be so altered as<lb/>
to leave out what is objectionable and misleading, which is the best<lb/>
we can hope for it. I only trust the beastly thing hasn't gone to<lb/>
press in its present form, as I'd hate to have the Nobel Prize and the<lb/>
entire credit <add>for the findings</add> of the Reed Board bestowed on Father, after the MS had<lb/>
been given me for correction!</p>
<p>Miss Brown and I str<del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del><add>a</add>ightened up a lot of long verbatim quota-<lb/>
tions last night (in the bound I. H. B. books). Its slow work, but<lb/>
I'll send them back as soon as I can. Just got Mendieta's Historia<lb/>
Eclesiastica Indiana (for Section iii, part i--the Americas) the other<lb/>
day (its been lost) and we started verifying its refs. this A. M.</p>
<p>Hoping you've had a pleasant week-end, <del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> plenty of golf (in al-<lb/>
most as good company as you yourself afforded!) a good rest, and &ldquo;lurid<lb/>
literature&rdquo; enough to make you forget your editorial labors,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>
<signed>Laura A. Carter</signed>
Love to the Suaans.<lb/>
