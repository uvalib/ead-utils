Colonel J. F. Siler<lb/>
3434-34th Place N.W.<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Siler:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It has disappointed me that I was not able to attend last year's meeting<lb/>
of the Walter Reed Memorial Association. As you know, I had just returned<lb/>
from one European trip and was preparing to go back to Stockholm.</p>
<p>Because of my absences from the Clinic this year, I will not be able to<lb/>
make more than one more trip away from the Clinic. I must speak in<lb/>
New York on October 11, in Pittsburgh on October 18 and between that<lb/>
time will be visiting my son at New Haven (Yale Medical School) and my<lb/>
daughter at Wellesley. Because of this trip, I will not be able to<lb/>
go east during November. I wondered whether you were planning to have<lb/>
a meeting of the Walter Reed Memorial Association in November and whether<lb/>
any items were coming up that should require my presence. If there are<lb/>
any important things being brought up and if you do want me, would it<lb/>
be just as convenient to have the meeting in October? The only day that<lb/>
I could conveniently come to Washington would be Wednesday, October 17.<lb/>
I could leave Boston the evening of the 16th, get to Washington the morning<lb/>
of the 17th, and leave that evening for Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>I myself have no special items to bring up at present. I have helped<lb/>
several writers recently who were writing something in connection with<lb/>
Walter Reed's 100th birthday, among them Mrs. Mary Standlee of the Walter<lb/>
Reed Hospital, and more recently a New York physician who arranged some<lb/>
sort of a Walter Reed celebration at Bellevue Hospital.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hench and I are going again to Cuba in January and I hope during my<lb/>
visit to try once more to revive the Cubans' plans to protect Walter Reed's<lb/>
Building No. 1. Until I go there in January, I will have nothing to report<lb/>
to the Walter Reed Memorial Association.</p>
<p>If you believe that it is not necessary for me to come this fall and if you<lb/>
prefer to have the meeting in November, that will be certainly all right<lb/>
with me. I would appreciate it greatly if you would telegraph me collect<lb/>
on receipt of this letter so that I can make my pullman connections either<lb/>
from Boston directly to Pittsburgh, or from Boston by way of Washington.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M.D.</signed>
