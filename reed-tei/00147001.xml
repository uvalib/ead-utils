<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am back again in Edinburgh.<lb/>
I reached here from Glasgow a little before<lb/>
ten last night and came at once to<lb/>
Mrs Magills and I am now in my old<lb/>
room. My plan was to take an<lb/>
excursion to Dundee to-day, but I<lb/>
found that I had a great many<lb/>
things to do and I am a little tired<lb/>
of sight seeing anyhow, so I gave<lb/>
up the trip. I reached Glasgow<lb/>
yesterday about noon and went<lb/>
to the Post Office at once and mailed<lb/>
a letter to you. Then I went with<lb/>
Norris and Knapp and took lunch<lb/>
and afterward visited the University<lb/>
of Glasgow and went to the <unclear>Heniterian</unclear><lb/>
Museum of Anatomy which is in one<lb/>
of the <del>P</del> buildings of the University.<lb/>
The university buildings are very fine.<lb/>
We also went to the cathedral which<lb/>
is one of the sights of the place.<lb/>
Yesterday happened to be Glasgow Train<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00147002"/>
day which is one of the old local<lb/>
holidays. We went out to Whitevale<lb/>
where the people were having their<lb/>
so-called fun. It was the oddest<lb/>
sight I ever saw. There was an<lb/>
enclosure full of merry-go-rounds<lb/>
swings and shows of all kinds<lb/>
and packed with people mostly<lb/>
drunk. There were at least twenty<lb/>
five merry-go-rounds. They each had<lb/>
an orchestrian and every now and<lb/>
then they blew steam whistles to<lb/>
attract attention. These things have<lb/>
not only the circular motion but<lb/>
also an up and down motion.</p>
<p>Then there was a long string of little shows<lb/>
which gave performances lasting about<lb/>
half an hour charging a penny or two.<lb/>
Between each performance the company<lb/>
came out on a kind of balcony and<lb/>
gave a sample of their performance<lb/>
before the crowd, meanwhile an orchestrian<lb/>
played, the managers howled swung rattles<lb/>
blew horns and made every possible noise<lb/>
to attract attention to their own shows.<lb/>
The whole thing made a din that was<lb/>
indiscribable. I wanted to see Glasgow<lb/>
in its every day garb as it is said to be<lb/>
a very busy bustling city but I had to<lb/>
make the best of it as I found it. I had<lb/>
never given Glasgow credit for being so<lb/>
large a city as it is. Its population is 750,000<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00147003"/>
and it is the second city in Great Britain.<lb/>
It is larger than Liverpool and <del>three</del><lb/>
twice <del>times</del> as large as Edinburgh.<lb/>
I will leave early tomorrow for<lb/>
London.</p>
<p>2 Queens Square Place<lb/>
Queens Square<lb/>
Bloomsburg<lb/>
London, W.C.</p>
<p>July 23.</p>
<p>The above is the situation of my London<lb/>
lodgings. I reached here on Monday night<lb/>
and stayed that night at the Midland<lb/>
Grand Hotel. Yesterday morning I started<lb/>
out in search of lodgings and finally hit upon<lb/>
this place. It is on a little offset from<lb/>
Queens Square and is as quiet as the<lb/>
country, and is very cheap. I get the<lb/>
room for eight shillings a week and<lb/>
the landlady gives me breakfast charging<lb/>
me just for what I eat. I get lunch<lb/>
and dinner elsewhere. This is a better<lb/>
plan than boarding, as it would be<lb/>
impossible to come home to all meals.<lb/>
I am afraid that this letter will<lb/>
miss the boat. I thought it sailed<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00147004"/>
on Thursday but I find it is today.<lb/>
However I will close and hurry<lb/>
and mail it in the hope that it<lb/>
will go. I will write more about<lb/>
London next <del>week</del> letter</p>
<p>Love to all</p>
