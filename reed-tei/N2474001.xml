<p>Surgeon General Sternberg's Circular.</p>
<p>We note with interest the fact that<lb/>
Surgeon General Sternberg's circular <hi>does<lb/>
not carry the mosquito hypothesis quite<lb/>
so far</hi>, in connection with yellow fever, as<lb/>
have done so many of his less experi-<lb/>
enced but more optimistic subordinates.<lb/>
He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The recent experiments made in Havana by the<lb/>
medical department of the army having proved that<lb/>
yellow fever, like malarial fever, is conveyed chiefly<lb/>
and probably exclusively by the bite of infected<lb/>
mosquitoes, <hi>important changes in the measures used</hi><lb/>
for the prevention and treatment of this disease<lb/>
have become necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presumably, Dr. Sternberg does not re-<lb/>
fer to the case of the individual patient<lb/>
when he speaks of &ldquo;important changes<lb/>
in the measures used for the prevention<lb/>
and treatment of this disease.&rdquo; It has<lb/>
not transpired that the symptoms of the<lb/>
patient have undergone any important<lb/>
modification since the announcement of<lb/>
the mosquito theory, and we assume,<lb/>
therefore, that the yellow fever victim<lb/>
will be handled pretty much in the future<lb/>
as he has been in the past. It is easy to<lb/>
see, however, that an adoption of this<lb/>
theory will necessarily involve radical<lb/>
amendments in the treatment of the mal-<lb/>
ady itself. Indeed, this seems to be the<lb/>
meaning of the next paragraph in the<lb/>
circular:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as yellow fever is concerned, infection of<lb/>
a room or building simply means that it contains<lb/>
infected mosquitoes--that is, mosquitoes which have<lb/>
fed on yellow fever patients. Disinfection, there-<lb/>
fore, means the employment of measures aimed at<lb/>
the destruction of these mosquitoes. The most ef-<lb/>
fective of these measures is fumigation, either with<lb/>
sulphur, formaldehyde, or insect powder. The<lb/>
fumes of sulphur are the quickest and the most ef-<lb/>
fective insecticide, but are otherwise objectionable.<lb/>
Formaldehyde gas is quite effective if the infected<lb/>
rooms are kept closed and sealed for two or three<lb/>
hours. The smoke of insect powder has also been<lb/>
proved useful; it readily stupefies mosquitoes, which<lb/>
drop to the floor and can be easily destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, there is to be an end<lb/>
to the foolish and mischievous supersti-<lb/>
tions of the past; to most of the bar-<lb/>
barities of quarantine, maritime and in-<lb/>
land; to the brutal paralysis of commerce,<lb/>
and the horrors of the shotgun cordon.<lb/>
<hi>The Southern States will--at l&eacute;ast in time<lb/>
--rid themselves of the swarms of petty<lb/>
local officials, salaried chiefly to the end<lb/>
of working material injury to the tax</hi>-<lb/>
payers. Business, travel, the transporta-<lb/>
tion of the mails, &amp;c., will be conducted<lb/>
on lines that run parallel with enlight-<lb/>
ened civilization. <hi>Yellow fever will be<lb/>
taken out of politics and handed over to<lb/>
the custody of science. Surely</hi>, a blessed<lb/>
and most welcome consummation!</p>
<p><hi>To such of our esteemed contemporaries</hi><lb/>
--and these are chiefly Southern contem-<lb/>
poraries, as is natural enough, since the<lb/>
North and West take only an academic<lb/>
interest in the subject--to such of these<lb/>
<hi>as have seen fit to ridicule or to antag-<lb/>
onize Dr. Sternberg's postulate, we beg<lb/>
to suggest that the Surgeon General has<lb/>
at no time declared the mosquito to be<lb/>
either the original cause of yellow fever<lb/>
or its only possible vehicle of transmis-<lb/>
sion</hi>. Neither, as we understand him, does<lb/>
he prophesy that the conditions now<lb/>
known to prevail at Havana, where yel-<lb/>
low fever is indigenous, will necessarily<lb/>
be exactly reproduced in this country,<lb/>
where it is exotic. But it has been dem-<lb/>
onstrated that yellow fever is always<lb/>
communicable by mosquitoes, and that it<lb/>
is never communicated by personal con-<lb/>
tact; and upon these ascertained facts<lb/>
the Surgeon General is abundantly war-<lb/>
ranted in setting up the propositions we<lb/>
have quoted from his circular.</p>
