<salute>My dear Dr. Finlay,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciate your frank letter of August 6. I am sorry that<lb/>
you feel that Mr. Cornwell did not get a good likeness of your father,<lb/>
particularly because of the fact that he is one of the two most import-<lb/>
ant figures in the painting.</p>
<p>We, of course, know that the painting is not literally correct<lb/>
from the historical standpoint but we felt that no picture which pre-<lb/>
sented a photographic and literal representation of any one incident in<lb/>
the yellow fever story could possibly tell anything like the whole truth.</p>
<p>For example, the inoculation of Carroll's arm which took place<lb/>
in a small laboratory could not be depicted in that little building in-<lb/>
asmuch as so few persons could be placed in the painting. Reed, of course,<lb/>
was not present, but certainly he was present in spirit. The scene which<lb/>
we originally conceived--that of your father presenting the mosquitos'<lb/>
eggs to the Yellow Fever Commission would leave out Major-General Wood.<lb/>
As we now understand it, Wood's cooperation in getting the money and allow-<lb/>
ing the experiments on human beings to take place was of primary importance</p>
<p>Then again, the original conception would have left out any credit<lb/>
due to the soldiers who heroically submitted themselves for experimentation,<lb/>
the most outstanding of which were Kissinger and Moran.</p>
<p>In other words, Dr. Finlay, we feel that this painting is more true<lb/>
to the spirit of the Yellow Fever Investigation than any literal picture<lb/>
might have been. It is an arrangement of portraits commemorative of as<lb/>
many of the people involved as could be used with a maximum of artistic<lb/>
license. Some of our critics have suggested several names that might well<lb/>
have been included except that there was a limit to the number that could<lb/>
be artistically handled in the composition of the painting.</p>
