President R. C. Hutchison<lb/>
Washington and Jefferson College<lb/>
Washington, Pa.<lb/>
<salute>My dear President Hutchison:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter, sent to me in Baltimore, has been<lb/>
forwarded to me here where I am spending my summer vacation.</p>
<p>I am delighted to know that the memory of the late<lb/>
Dr. Jesse Lazear, who was an alumnus of Washington and<lb/>
Jefferson College, is to be honored by naming a chemistry<lb/>
building after him. Unfortunately, owing to other appoint-<lb/>
ments in October, I cannot be with you on October twenty-<lb/>
sixth when the building is to be dedicated. Dr. Lazear<lb/>
sacrificed his life that others might live.</p>
<p>COPY</p>
<p>During the time (1895 - 1900) when Doctor Lazear was<lb/>
working at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, I was living in the<lb/>
hospital and knew him well and greatly admired him because of<lb/>
his high ideals and pleasing personality. He had taken his<lb/>
A. B. degree at Johns Hopkins University in 1889 and his<lb/>
M. D. degree at Columbia University (College of Physicians<lb/>
and Surgeons) in 1892. He had then served as interne in<lb/>
Bellevue Hospital, New York City, for two years, after which<lb/>
he pursued post graduate studies in Europe (especially in Paris)<lb/>
for one year. On his return to America in 1895, he became<lb/>
Assistant Resident Physician (service of Professor Osler)<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03570003"/>
-2-<lb/>
in the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In the summer of 1896, he<lb/>
married and began private practice in Baltimore, but<lb/>
acted also (until 1900) as assistant in the teaching of<lb/>
Chemical Microscopy in the Johns Hopkins Hospital and as a<lb/>
member of the Out-Patient Staff of the hospital.</p>
<p>In February, 1900, he left for work in the medical<lb/>
service of the U. S. Army, going to Columbia Barracks, near<lb/>
Havanna, Cuba. He was a member of the group (headed by Dr.<lb/>
Walker Reed) that undertook the study of the cause of Yellow<lb/>
Fever. He volunteered to be one of those who allowed them-<lb/>
selves to be bitten by a certain mosquito that had bitten<lb/>
yellow fever patients. Dr. Lazear developed the disease and<lb/>
died of it at Quema doo, Cuba, on September 25th, 1900.</p>
<p>He had written a paper entitled &ldquo;Pathology of<lb/>
Malarial Fevers, Structures of the Parasites and Changes<lb/>
in Tissue,&rdquo; which was published (after his death) in the<lb/>
Journal of The American Medical Association for Oct. 13th,<lb/>
1900.</p>
<p>In the Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin (1900,<lb/>
Vol.XI, p. 290) will be found an obituary notice written by<lb/>
the late Dr. William S. Thayer.</p>
<p>In the same journal in the following year (1901,<lb/>
Vol. XII), an appeal was made for subscriptions for a memorial,<lb/>
the committee consisting of Dr. William Osler, Dr. Stewart<lb/>
Paton, and Dr. William S. Thayer.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f03570004"/>
<p>-3-</p>
<p>In the Bulletin in 1902 (Vol.XIII, p. 25), it was<lb/>
stated that the fund raised as a memorial would be used as<lb/>
a permanent scholarship for the study of tropical diseases<lb/>
or as a library fund.</p>
