<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been a poor corres-<lb/>
pondent lately as I have been<lb/>
on a visit to my son in Rich-<lb/>
mond and on my return last<lb/>
Friday had, before I could<lb/>
clean my disk, an attack of<lb/>
paroxysmal <unclear>auricular fihillatine</unclear><lb/>
to which I am subject for now<lb/>
5 or 6 years and which, Tho -<lb/>
not very dangerous, leaves me<lb/>
quite weak and good-for-nothing<lb/>
for some days- My son Dr. Robert<lb/>
H. Kean (who is not an M. D. but a<lb/>
Ph. D. in Chemistry) drove me up to,<lb/>
Charlottesville for the Moran dinner<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06284095"/>
2<lb/>
we had perfect weather and were<lb/>
home again by midnight, after<lb/>
a very pleasant time. There were<lb/>
26 present including your brother<lb/>
and Mr. Clemons the librarian-<lb/>
Moran had made Dean Jordan<lb/>
who presided, promise not to call<lb/>
on him for a speech. Dr. Jordan<lb/>
gave a brief outline of the yellow<lb/>
fever episode which I followed<lb/>
by an informal talk filling in<lb/>
the points which he did not<lb/>
touch on- When I got to the<lb/>
volunteering of Moran &amp; Kissinger<lb/>
I said that Moran had exacted a<lb/>
promise that he would not be<lb/>
called on for a speech, but if<lb/>
he kept his seal (as I had done)<lb/>
I was sure he would not object<lb/>
to answering any questions made<lb/>
by his hosts-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06284096"/>
3.<lb/>
So they started in to ask them and<lb/>
he, after he got started, secured<lb/>
really to enjoy it and talked<lb/>
freely and at length until it was<lb/>
time to bring the <unclear>dinner</unclear> to an<lb/>
end-</p>
<p>Mrs Kean forwarded to me in Rich-<lb/>
mond your two letters and I<lb/>
sent you on the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> a telegram<lb/>
to your mother's address, suggest-<lb/>
ing that you eliminate the statement<lb/>
on page 3 that Dr. Finlay was &ldquo;slightly<lb/>
<hi>touched</hi>&rdquo;. Such an intimation in a<lb/>
public address would, I feel sure,<lb/>
be bitterly resented by the Cuban<lb/>
people and would undo all<lb/>
our efforts to re-establish good feeling<lb/>
between the Cuban doctors and the pro-<lb/>
fession in this country- Also I<lb/>
do not think it was true of him<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06284097"/>
4<lb/>
at the time that Reed knew him-<lb/>
and I first knew him- Some ten<lb/>
years after, his mind began to fail<lb/>
from <unclear>senile dementia</unclear> and he was<lb/>
retired on his 75<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> birthday Dec. 3.<lb/>
1908- with a handsome pension &amp;<lb/>
the title of Honorary President of the<lb/>
National Board of Health &amp; Charities-<lb/>
I think we should be careful to<lb/>
treat his memory with great respect.</p>
<p>Did you read in my address at<lb/>
Belroi on the dedication of Reed's<lb/>
birthplace the account of the <unclear>dinner</unclear><lb/>
given by the Medical men of Havana<lb/>
to Dr. Finlay on Dec. 22, 1900- To cele-<lb/>
brate the confirmation by the Reed<lb/>
Board of the Finlay theory of the trans-<lb/>
mission of yellow fever by the Stego-<lb/>
myia mosquito? It is also told in my letter<lb/>
Was there more to this letter??<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06284098"/>
5<lb/>
to Moran of which I think Mr Clemons<lb/>
gave you a photostat copy-<lb/>
I have been much interested in<lb/>
your quotations from Lazear's letters<lb/>
to his wife and am delighted that<lb/>
you are in touch with her and that<lb/>
she has been willing to help you.</p>
<p>Your five box with the diary<lb/>
and other papers came last Saturday<lb/>
26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I suppose the extracts you have<lb/>
photostated are all right- Can you not<lb/>
eliminate the reference to Col. V. E. Wood<lb/>
the chief <unclear>Commissary</unclear> who was afraid<lb/>
to ride over with us to Capt. Page's <unclear></unclear><lb/>
&ldquo;on account of the danger to his family&rdquo; and<lb/>
my rather unkind remark to Gen. Lee that<lb/>
the only danger was that he might fall<lb/>
off his horse- Gen. Lee had a poor opinion<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06284099"/>
6.<lb/>
of officer who could not ride, and<lb/>
a still poorer one of those who were<lb/>
afraid- He was'nt afraid of anything or<lb/>
any body and so could not understand<lb/>
people who were- In the list of those<lb/>
in Marianao who had yellow fever the <unclear>&amp;</unclear><lb/>
after the names of some means that they<lb/>
were fatal cases- as Long fellow in his<lb/>
fine poem <hi>Moriturti Salutamus</hi> refers to<lb/>
as those against whose names<lb/>
The fatal asterisk of death is set-<lb/>
I read over yesterday the entries for<lb/>
1901-2 in the next volume of my<lb/>
diary- There is'nt much, as things<lb/>
moved rapidly and I think<lb/>
it would be easier to copy<lb/>
out extracts than to send the<lb/>
volume, which is a thick one<lb/>
and has many posted-in snap<lb/>
shots of my young children etc-<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06284100"/>
7<lb/>
I will go over it again however<lb/>
in the near future before decid<lb/>
ing- I must congratulate you again<lb/>
on your discovery &amp; identification<lb/>
of Building No.1- It is perfect<lb/>
and will, I am sure satisfy<lb/>
every <unclear>&amp; Keptie-</unclear> It is surprising<lb/>
that after 40 years a wooden shack<lb/>
like this would have survived<lb/>
the termites and decay of a tropical<lb/>
climate- I think your plan of<lb/>
buying it and giving it to the<lb/>
Cubans is fine if it is well enough<lb/>
preserved to justify preservation-<lb/>
You did not know when you wrote<lb/>
if Dr. Cooke would be present at<lb/>
the dedication last Saturday. I hope<lb/>
he was there and I am keen to<lb/>
hear now he impressed you and<lb/>
how you find Kissinger compares<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06284101"/>
8<lb/>
with Moran- I have not seen him<lb/>
since 1901 but I have the impression<lb/>
that he has gone into the hero<lb/>
business rather heavily- Dr Cooke<lb/>
has never shown any disposition to<lb/>
exploit his experience <unclear>at all</unclear>, nor has<lb/>
Captain England-</p>
<p>This is a rather disconnected letter<lb/>
I am afraid as I have had many<lb/>
interruptions since I began it-<lb/>
I hope however that you will count<lb/>
it as an answer to your very interest-<lb/>
ing ones and will be good enough<lb/>
to send me a full account of the<lb/>
celebration- It is wonderful how<lb/>
many threads of information you<lb/>
have brought together in your<lb/>
<unclear>arduous</unclear> researce- With congratulations<lb/>
and all good wishes I am.</p>
