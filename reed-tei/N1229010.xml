<p>__________________________________________________</p>
<p>DR. H. R. CARTER<lb/>
CLAIMED BY DEATH</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Former Assistant Surgeon<lb/>
General of Health Service<lb/>
Dies at Age of 73.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>DR. HENRY R. CARTER.</p>
<p>Dr. Henry R. Carter, 73 years old,<lb/>
former Assistant Surgeon General of<lb/>
the United States Public Health<lb/>
Service, and considered one of the<lb/>
foremost medical and sanitary spe-<lb/>
cialists in the country, died at the<lb/>
Westmoreland apartments, 2122 Cali-<lb/>
fornia street, today after a lingering<lb/>
illness.</p>
<p>Entered Service in 1879.</p>
<p>He was born in Clifton Plantation,<lb/>
Carolina County, Va., Auugst 25, 1852.<lb/>
He was commissioned in the United<lb/>
States Marine hospital service, now<lb/>
the public health Service. May<lb/>
5, 1879. He served as chief quar-<lb/>
antine officer of the Island of Cuba<lb/>
from January, 1899, until August,<lb/>
1900, and as chief quarantine officer<lb/>
of the Isthmian Canal commission<lb/>
from May, 1904, until February, 1905,<lb/>
when he became director of hospitals<lb/>
of the Isthmian Canal commission,<lb/>
serving in this capacity from March,<lb/>
1905, until September, 1909. He served<lb/>
at different times as sanitary super-<lb/>
visor to the Peruvian government and<lb/>
as a member of the international<lb/>
health board of the Rockefeller Foun-<lb/>
dation up until the time of his death.<lb/>
He retired July, 1920.</p>
<p>Among the most notable of his sani-<lb/>
tary and scientific achievements were<lb/>
the determination of the period of ex-<lb/>
trinsic incubation of yellow fever, a<lb/>
foundation on which the brilliant work<lb/>
of Walter Reed and his commission<lb/>
rested and for which Dr. Carter was<lb/>
nominated for the Nobel prize by the<lb/>
__________________________________________________<lb/>
distinguished English physician and<lb/>
sanitarian, <del><unclear>Maj.</unclear></del><add>Sir</add> Ronald Ross.</p>
<p>He was the founder of the present<lb/>
maritime quarantine system of the<lb/>
United States. Dr. Carter served in<lb/>
and dominated many outbreaks of yel-<lb/>
low feved epidemics in the Southern<lb/>
States, including that of MacHenry,<lb/>
Miss, the first outbreak of this disease<lb/>
which was controlled during the Sum-<lb/>
mer months<unclear>;</unclear> inaugurated the quaran-<lb/>
tine systems of Cuba and the Canal<lb/>
ports.</p>
<p>He enunciated the principles relat-<lb/>
ing to the bearing of the impounding<lb/>
of great bodies of waters on the pro-<lb/>
duction of malaria, a matter in which<lb/>
the economic future of many parts of<lb/>
our Southern States is bound up.</p>
<p>He inaugurated control measures<lb/>
for malaria in the extra cantonment<lb/>
areas of Army camps in malarial<lb/>
regions during the World War. He<lb/>
was a member of many scientific<lb/>
bodies relating to medicine and<lb/>
hygiene, both American and foreign.<lb/>
He formulated the doctrine of the<lb/>
control of the yellow fever bearing<lb/>
mosquito as the sole method necessary<lb/>
for the elimination of endemic centers<lb/>
of this disease.</p>
<p>Rites on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He was intimately associated with<lb/>
Gen. Gorgas and Col. Walter Reed<lb/>
throughout the greater parts of their<lb/>
careers, particularly in the work,<lb/>
study and control of yellow fever. It<lb/>
is doubtful if modern science records<lb/>
a like example of men of kindred<lb/>
sympathies and almost common birth<lb/>
whose labors in the same field of<lb/>
endeavor yielded such notable results.</p>
<p>The funeral services will take place<lb/>
__________________________________________________<lb/>
at 10 o'clock Wednesday morning at<lb/>
the Westmoreland, and later at St.<lb/>
Margaret's Church. Archdeacon<lb/>
Sterling Claiborne of Sewanee, Tenn.,<lb/>
and Rev. Dr. Smith of St. Margaret's<lb/>
Church will conduct the funeral serv-<lb/>
ices. Relatives, friends and officers<lb/>
of the service will accompany the<lb/>
body on the noon train Wednesday to<lb/>
Ashland. Va., its final resting place,<lb/>
beside his wife, who died a number of<lb/>
years ago.</p>
