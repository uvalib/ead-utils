<p>Carter does not see the need to provide weekly updates as she is still waiting for Frost to resume work on the manuscript. She also fills him in on her activities since early August.</p>

<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>After my return to Washington early in August, at which time,<lb/>
as I then wrote you, I had hoped and expected the final editing on<lb/>
Father's book would be resumed, I was looking forward to again writing<lb/>
to you regularly as to the progress of the work. Shortly thereafter, however,<lb/>
while spending some time in Baltimore with the Frosts, Dr. Frost told me<lb/>
that--although he intended resuming the final editing of the History of<lb/>
Yellow Fever as soon as he possibly could--he was not then in a position to<lb/>
take up the work, as other things had accumulated during his absence in<lb/>
Europe and <unclear>said</unclear> that you were perfectly aware of this fact.</p>
<p>In view therefore of Dr. Frost's statement that he had informed you<lb/>
as to the status of the work of the final editing, I hardly felt that it was<lb/>
<add>un</add>necessary to take up your time by writing regularly as to what Miss Brown<lb/>
and I were doing, although we have been having a very busy time.</p>
<p>The reference cards being already, for the most part, verified and<lb/>
revised as carefully as possible, we have been, in the main, concentrating our<lb/>
efforts on the library cards in the endeavor to settle various technical points<lb/>
as to clearness and form. Their accuracy, of course, Miss Brown had established<lb/>
long since. In this work we again had the great good fortune to have the help<lb/>
of Dr. Martel, Chief of the Catalogue Division of the Library of Congress, who<lb/>
is, as you know, an outstanding authority on things of this sort. He went over<lb/>
the last 3&sol;5 of the cards with us and we hope to have his advice upon the<lb/>
others as soon as Dr. Frost can let us have them. Dr. Martel told us that the<lb/>
cards were in excellent form and really needed no alterations from a librarian's<lb/>
standpoint. This, of course, I owe to Miss Brown. He, nevertheless, made some<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fc0326057"/>
some<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
very valuable suggestions as to several changes in the form of some of these<lb/>
cards, which Miss Brown has already carried out, and which, we think, will make<lb/>
them clearer to those readers of the History of Yellow Fever who wish to consult<lb/>
our original sources.</p>
<p><hi>Re</hi> our illustrative material, I had hoped to be able to discuss the matter<lb/>
at some length with Dr. Frost,in order to decide on the best way in which to<lb/>
present it, before again taking up the matter with Mr. Bushnell of the Smithsonian<lb/>
Institution and <del>those of</del> the specialists in this line of work to whom he had<lb/>
promised to introduce me. Dr. Frost was, however, too busy during my stay in<lb/>
Baltimore for me to even attempt to begin the discussion of this subject. There<lb/>
will, however, be plenty of time later to attend to any minor changes (if such are<lb/>
deemed advisable) in our present material <add>for illustrations</add> without in <unclear>a<add>ny</add>way</unclear> holding up the com-<lb/>
pletion of the MS.</p>
<p>Miss Brown and I came to &ldquo;Dunlora&rdquo; a few days ago, bringing with us<lb/>
duplicate<add>s of</add> cards and other material in the possession of Dr. Frost in order to<lb/>
continue the work here. I am hoping each day to hear that Dr. Frost has been<lb/>
able to resume the final editing. Of this, of course,, he will advise you as<lb/>
soon as (or sooner than) he does me. When once he has time for it, we know how<lb/>
rapidly, as well as <add>how excellently!</add><del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> he will &ldquo;put things through.&rdquo; I am so<lb/>
very glad that you spoke to him about writing a biographic sketch of Father to<lb/>
preceed the History!</p>
<p>With all manner of good wishes, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>
