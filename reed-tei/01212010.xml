<salute>My dear Doctor Baker:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It was a pleasure to get your<lb/>
note of the 18 inst. rec'd yesterday and<lb/>
I could almost see &ldquo;Miss Baker&rdquo; telling her<lb/>
&ldquo;little <unclear>tory bout</unclear> me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I knew that your son was at Oxford. I wrote<lb/>
you when he rec'd the scholarship. From<lb/>
Osler's account there were far better<lb/>
places to study medicine than Oxford<lb/>
<del>wd</del> at the time he went there as<lb/>
Regins Professor. He was trying to in-<lb/>
troduce changes in both methods &amp; cur-<lb/>
riculum when I last saw him.</p>
<p>Yes I am down &amp; but for Laura would be<lb/>
out, I retired: went on the retired list, on<lb/>
<del>July 20/192</del>. May 5 1920 at the end of <hi>41</hi><lb/>
years <add>active</add> service. I was due the previous year<lb/>
but was kept on on account of the War. I<lb/>
went then to Peru, (Indeed went down in Feb-<lb/>
ruary on leave without pay status) &amp; stayed<lb/>
there as Consultor Sanitario for 22 months<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01212011"/>
2<lb/>
months- Substituting General Gorgas<lb/>
<del>wuld</del> (at his request) until his death &amp;<lb/>
thereafter in charge for the Peruvian<lb/>
Government of a rather extensive epi-<lb/>
demic of Yellow Fever &amp; a larger but<lb/>
less intense one of Plague.</p>
<p>Last Fall. I was doing some work for the<lb/>
Aluminum Company of America- ma-<lb/>
king a malaria-survey of <del>our of</del> a large<lb/>
pond of one of their hydro-electric plants<lb/>
in N. Carolina when I had an attack of<lb/>
Angina Pectoris &amp; lay 13 hours under<lb/>
a dog-wood bush before I could get<lb/>
any nitro-glycerine, This was the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of<lb/>
August - &amp; I stayed in hospital there<lb/>
(at Badin N. C.) until Oct 8- having<lb/>
two other attacks in the interior: Thence to<lb/>
Hopkins where I stayed until Novem 15.<lb/>
Thence one here, where I was confined<lb/>
for 3 1/2 months to bed &amp; then to one floor to<lb/>
July 10: Then I went to Kingston Jamaica<lb/>
to attend the Conference of Tropical<lb/>
Medicine<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01212012"/>
3<lb/>
Medicine &amp; Hygiene there. Thence on my re-<lb/>
turn trip to Panama where I spent<lb/>
2 weeks at my old &ldquo;stamping ground.&rdquo;<lb/>
thence have via Carthagena: Sta. Marta,<lb/>
&amp; Havana, getting back, Septem 8.</p>
<p>I stood the trip well. was carried aboard<lb/>
ship in a chair - as I had to give a promise<lb/>
not to go up more than <hi>3</hi> stair steps-<lb/>
but once aboard I minded the ship<lb/>
no more than I would a hotel, although we<lb/>
caught the tail end of a hurricane on<lb/>
our return - off Cape San Antonio.</p>
<p>I am down &amp; can do no more field work. &amp;<lb/>
but for Laura's help could do no more of any<lb/>
King. I am, since Jan/22, supposed to be<lb/>
writing a history of yellow fever for the<lb/>
Internat'l Health Board (Rockefeller<lb/>
Found'n), but have been abable to do very-<lb/>
little on it since my attack. I have a-<lb/>
bout 25 lbs of notes still to write up, but<lb/>
in addition have to go to the Congressional<lb/>
Library for data, lacking from time to<lb/>
time<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01212013"/>
4<lb/>
time. This I could not do at my former<lb/>
quarters - because I was on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> floor; <del>with</del><lb/>
&amp; with no elivator. Here <del><unclear>was</unclear></del> we have an<lb/>
elevator &amp; I can get in &amp; out. &amp; with a<lb/>
taxi can get to the Library- No one <unclear>are</unclear><lb/>
a member of Congress: ahead of a Depart. or<lb/>
a newspaper man. can take book,<lb/>
<hi>out</hi> of the Library, but they too have an<lb/>
elevator &amp; I can read there, I am pur-<lb/>
posing to begin again <unclear>then</unclear> about Oct<lb/>
15, I will not live long enough to<lb/>
complete the book- I was 73 on Aug 25.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
but if I can hold on for 6 months longer<lb/>
even as I am, (, I have &ldquo;let down&rdquo; mentally I<lb/>
think a good deal &amp; am on the watch<lb/>
for senility as is both Laura &amp; a medi-<lb/>
cal friend of mine), I should be able to<lb/>
complete sect iii thereof. &ldquo;The Place of<lb/>
Origin of Yellow Fever&rdquo; which<del>,</del> if I<lb/>
can finish rightly &amp; finally, so that<lb/>
no one else will have to repeat my re-<lb/>
search, will content me &amp; be worth doing.<lb/>
The next man can then begin were I<lb/>
left off.</p>
<p>It</p>
<pb n="5" id="f01212014"/>
<p>5</p>
<p>It is not only with past things I have been<lb/>
occupied however, I am <hi>consultant</hi><lb/>
for the I, H. B, in all matters connected<lb/>
with yellow fever work- You know that<lb/>
they have untertaken a campaign to,<lb/>
if possible eleminate this infection<lb/>
from the Earth. This is a magnificent<lb/>
conception &amp;, while I will not live to see it<lb/>
done, yet there is a fair <del>possibility</del><add>prospect</add> of its<lb/>
success &amp; I thank God, &amp; am proud that I<lb/>
had a hand in its inception &amp; have<lb/>
borne my part in <del>its</del> the work for<lb/>
its instution. But for the problem<lb/>
that Africa sets us. I would have<lb/>
written &ldquo;certainty&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;fair<lb/>
<del>prospect</del> prospect&rdquo; above, I offered, &amp;<lb/>
wanted (recommended myself) to take<lb/>
charge of the work in West Africa.<lb/>
when I got back from S. America in 1922<lb/>
but was not accepted on account of my<lb/>
physical condition. I judge that it<lb/>
would have killed me. but if I could<lb/>
have had 12 months life there or even 9<lb/>
months<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01212015"/>
6 6<lb/>
months it had been worth <unclear>ten</unclear> men's<lb/>
lives. However I can still help a little,<lb/>
especially since I have quizzed old Sir<lb/>
James Fowler: Stephins: Alfred, Horne &amp; le-<lb/>
Fann - all West Coast of Africa men,- at<lb/>
Kingston, I would however give every<lb/>
thing I have, except my immortal<lb/>
soul, if I could spend the next 3 or<lb/>
even 2, years in the Gulf of Guinea-<lb/>
from the Gold Coast to the mouth of the<lb/>
Congo.</p>
<p>I am very ungrateful however- A<lb/>
man who has been able to do field work<lb/>
to with in 21 days of his 72<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> birth day &amp;<lb/>
work of some value, though less, after<lb/>
his 73<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> surely cannot complain that<lb/>
the good Lord has not given him<lb/>
time enough on earth to do all requir-<lb/>
ed of him, or all that he could claim that<lb/>
he had a right to do, &amp; I <hi>am</hi> thank-<lb/>
ful &amp; grateful.</p>
<p>One thing only I have the highest rest-<lb/>
pect for the late David <unclear>ben Jesse</unclear>-<lb/>
as a part &amp; a pious one. but he is all<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01212016"/>
B7<lb/>
all wrong when he says that a man's<lb/>
live after 70 is &ldquo;labor &amp; sorrow&rdquo;. I<lb/>
confess that I have been handicapped since<lb/>
67 by a <unclear>sano-iliac</unclear> relaxation &amp; since <del>/</del> 72 by<lb/>
my heart. yet,- (leaving out 3 months &amp; 1/2<lb/>
when I lay with a raised <unclear>foot</unclear> of the bed &amp; in<lb/>
pain from time to time) that have been<lb/>
few hours of the day-. six days a week-<lb/>
that I did not fill, with something <del>in-<lb/>
teresting</del> always interesting &amp; some-<lb/>
times useful. I have no kick coming<lb/>
except against Washington landlords<lb/>
I pay $175. for this apartment, <del>of which</del> <add>4 rooms</add> un-<lb/>
furnished- of which I suppose 75 is for<lb/>
the elevator as I paid only $100. for the previous<lb/>
one. If I am living after section iii is<lb/>
finished I will leave Washington-&amp; <unclear>got</unclear><lb/>
to Charlottesville or some such place. At<lb/>
present I must have access to the Congression-<lb/>
al Library.</p>
<p><del>My fundamen</del> The Rockefeller people<lb/>
tell me that I should have begun the<lb/>
history earlier- I could not have done so &amp;<lb/>
cleaned the West Coat of South America,<lb/>
P&eacute;ru<lb/>

8 <del>5</del><lb/>
P&eacute;ru &amp; Ecuador, of yellow fever, my<lb/>
fundamental error was in being<lb/>
born in 1851 instead of 1872 It is<lb/>
<hi>Alas</hi> irremediable</p>
<p>I am however content with the life I have<lb/>
had &amp; thank God for the opportunities,<lb/>
&amp; the inclination, He gave me to do<lb/>
do work useful to other men.</p>
<p>This is a rather crazy letter &amp; you<lb/>
think I am a little senile- It is sure-<lb/>
ly <unclear>garrulous</unclear> enough; yet I have not<lb/>
written to an old friend for so long<lb/>
that this should be a partial excuse<lb/>
for it.</p>
<p>Commend me to Mrs Baker &amp; to Mrs<lb/>
Waller - that was my little "Miss Baker<lb/>
- Helen was her name, &amp; to <unclear>Gerathmey</unclear> &amp;<lb/>
to old Field, Take much love to your<lb/>
self whom I have always held as es-<lb/>
