<salute>My dear Mr. Pogolotti:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I hope by now you have received the photographs and my other letter.<lb/>
I certainly appreciated receiving the maps, and I hope you have received some money<lb/>
from Mr. Moran to pay for the cost of them. If not, let me know, and I will send<lb/>
you some.</p>
<p>As I wrote you, I have been very, very busy these last six weeks, and have<lb/>
not been able to do anything much on the yellow fever story. I am going to medical<lb/>
meetings for two weeks, and thereafter will be able to get at it, and as I promised<lb/>
you, will certainly send the whole thing when finished, sometime this Summer.</p>
<p>I am sorry indeed to hear that you have been suffering with bronchial astha,<lb/>
and I wish that you had told me this, as we could discuss the matter more thoroughly<lb/>
in person than by mail. It is almost impossible to give any definite advice by mail.<lb/>
We differentiate between asthmatic bronchitis, which we consider to be an infection,<lb/>
and bronchial asthma, which we consider to be an allergic reaction, somewhat similar<lb/>
to hay fever. If you have not already done so, I would suggest that you put yourself<lb/>
in the hands of a physician who is particularly interested in allergy. Your family<lb/>
physician may know who that might be. If not, you can find out by calling the secretary<lb/>
of the local medical society or the Academy of Medicine. This physician will give you<lb/>
a complete examination for allergy. This is a rather difficult and complicated thing,<lb/>
involving a number of skin tests and other tests. He will doubtless check your nose and<lb/>
throat and sinuses, to see if you have any infection therein. He will probably advise<lb/>
the use of iodides or ephedrin pills. In some cases of bronchial asthma, we use<lb/>
epinephrin spray in a solution of 1:100. The patient inhales as he sprays the back of<lb/>
the throat.</p>
<p>I know of no booklet or pamphlet for laymen, and hesitate to suggest that you,<lb/>
a layman, read a medical textbook. However, if the library has Tuft's textbook on<lb/>
&ldquo;Clinical allergy&rdquo;, published by Saunders, might be useful.</p>
<p>If you are unable to get satisfactory results there, may I suggest that at<lb/>
some time you come up here. It isn't nearly as far as you think, and we should be<lb/>
delighted to &ldquo;give you the works&rdquo;.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
