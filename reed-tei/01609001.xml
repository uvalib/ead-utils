<salute>Miss Lawrence,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I will con-<lb/>
clude a day of unremitting<lb/>
application to my studies by<lb/>
replying to your last letter.<lb/>
This shall be to me an hour<lb/>
of rest and enjoyment. For a<lb/>
while, at least, I will shake<lb/>
off &ldquo;dull care&rdquo; and roam &ldquo;fancy<lb/>
free.&rdquo; Should you experience one<lb/>
tenth the pleasure in reading<lb/>
the pages before you, that I<lb/>
I do in writing them, I shall be<lb/>
more than satisfied.</p>
<p>Your letter came to hand<lb/>
last Saturday- I opened it and read<lb/>
it once, yes, twice; yea thrice;<lb/>
and each successive <del>time</del> reading<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01609002"/>
fresh pleasure brought. Nature<lb/>
has witholden blessings from<lb/>
you! Say you thus, Miss Law-<lb/>
rence? Oh! wonderful mistake!<lb/>
Nature has been lavish with<lb/>
her gifts to you, and not the<lb/>
least among those bestowed, is<lb/>
<add>the</add> faculty of expressing your<lb/>
thoughts in exquisitely beauti-<lb/>
ful language. So blessings to<lb/>
you! Why, were I not too<lb/>
modest and did I not know<lb/>
that you would be the first<lb/>
to upbraid my effort, I<lb/>
could fill a dozen pages with<lb/>
an enumeration of your gifts:<lb/>
talents of no common order;<lb/>
which you have had the<lb/>
faithfulness and wisdom to<lb/>
improve, till, today, they<lb/>
<add>shine forth as brightly as the</add> stars in Heavens gal-<lb/>
axy; albeit with a radiance<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01609003"/>
calm and pure. To this I bear<lb/>
emphatic testimony- Dull as I<lb/>
am and shall ever be, feeble<lb/>
as are my words, slow as is<lb/>
my tongue, I doubt not but<lb/>
that I could grow eloquent<lb/>
with such a theme. Modesty,<lb/>
intelligence, refinement, piety<lb/>
and beauty -- are these not<lb/>
jewels fit to deck any<lb/>
crown? Alas! when I recur to<lb/>
your letter and its contents,<lb/>
I feel almost constrained to<lb/>
lay aside my pen and wait<lb/>
for some inspiration to fit<lb/>
me for the task of replying.<lb/>
Think not that my words are<lb/>
shallow compliments, for such<lb/>
is foreign to my nature.I<lb/>
feel what I say, and you<lb/>
must pardon me if I speak<lb/>
too plainly. But what shall<lb/>
I say to the words of your letter?<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01609004"/>
If I mistake not, you wondered<lb/>
that you had not discovered<lb/>
that I was a poet. Well there is<lb/>
nothing strange about your<lb/>
failure so to do. <hi>I a poet</hi>?<lb/>
In vain the search. <hi>You</hi> are<lb/>
the one more deserving of<lb/>
such a title, since you com-<lb/>
bine a fervid imagination<lb/>
with high and holy thoughts;<lb/>
while I am a miserable<lb/>
rhymster. 'Tis true</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>I may have sung in simple rhyme,</l>
<l>And <hi>longed</hi> to soar above,</l>
<l>Up in the pure, etherial clime</l>
<l>Where bards delight to rove.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But when I fain would plume my <add>wings</add></l>
<l>And spread them to the winds,</l>
<l>An impulse bids me leave such things</l>
<l>To better, nobler minds.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="5" id="f01609005"/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Like some young bird I seek in vain</l>
<l>To bear myself on high;</l>
<l>My fruitless efforts end in pain,</l>
<l>I walk, but cannot fly.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>I must accept e'en adverse fate,</l>
<l>For oh! too well I know it,</l>
<l>Although in humble verse I prate,</l>
<l><hi>I'll never be a poet</hi>.</l>
</lg>
<p>No! No! don't tell me that<lb/>
I am a poet, for I have a<lb/>
great respect and love for<lb/>
poets, as a class, and I<lb/>
should much regret to be<lb/>
compelled to change my pres-<lb/>
ent opinion of them. Call me<lb/>
a worthless rhymster, and<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01609006"/>
I shall be happy and contented.<lb/>
And yet, from this worthless<lb/>
rhyming, strange as it may<lb/>
seem, I derive genuine, heart-<lb/>
felt pleasure, such as I ex-<lb/>
perience from no other men-<lb/>
tal occupation. Whether I am<lb/>
cheerful or sad, let me but<lb/>
convert my feelings into<lb/>
verse, however poor it would<lb/>
be in another's estimation, to<lb/>
me it is sweet indeed.<lb/>
When I have tossed off a<lb/>
few lines, I feel removed<lb/>
from my sadness, the load<lb/>
is lifted from my breast;<lb/>
my vision is clearer; my heart<lb/>
beats with a freer impulse;<lb/>
my spirits rise, and<lb/>
I am &ldquo;myself again&rdquo;.<lb/>
Though temporal af-<lb/>
fairs stand knocking at the<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01609007"/>
portal; ready to rush in and<lb/>
renew the battle; I escape them<lb/>
for a moment, and looking,<lb/>
with vision undaunted, up to<lb/>
my home above, I seem to<lb/>
hear a voice, whose sound is<lb/>
like the music of rippling<lb/>
waters, whispering to me,</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Each silent prayer expressed on <add>earth,</add></l>
<l>Will reach thy Father's ear;</l>
<l><hi>He</hi> knows thy sorrow, sees thy mirth,</l>
<l>Records thy falling tear.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But bear the burden meekly on,</l>
<l>Until the night be past,</l>
<l>A joyous, <hi>brighter</hi> day will dawn,</l>
<l>And bring thee Home at last.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Then standing on high Heaven's hills,</l>
<l>Thou'lt backward turn thy gaze,</l>
<l>And smiling at thy mortal ills,</l>
<l>Join in the hymns of praise</l>
</lg>
<pb n="8" id="f01609008"/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>That roll around thy Maker's throne,</l>
<l>Like surges on the shore;</l>
<l>&ldquo;The battle fought, the Victory won,</l>
<l>And sin and death are o'er.&rdquo;</l>
</lg>
<p>Now, I confess that in the<lb/>
foregoing lines, others would<lb/>
see nothing to admire; they<lb/>
would call it a mere jargon<lb/>
of words miserably put to-<lb/>
gether; nor could I blame<lb/>
them for arriving at so just<lb/>
a decision, and yet <hi>to me</hi>, the<lb/>
lines are pleasant, not from<lb/>
any merit of their own, but<lb/>
on account of the emotions<lb/>
that fill my bosom at the<lb/>
time of writing them: the thoughts,<lb/>
yea, the hopes that lift me<lb/>
up above the &ldquo;things of time,&rdquo;<lb/>
and bring to me a more vivid<lb/>
realization of &ldquo;things to come.&rdquo;<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01609009"/>
These emotions are mine and<lb/>
only mine; which another<lb/>
would not appreciate<lb/>
unless placed in the<lb/>
same position and in the same<lb/>
frame of mind; and to such an<lb/>
one as would question me as<lb/>
to their merit, or would freely<lb/>
criticise them, I could truthfully<lb/>
reply;</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Ah! friend, did you but know</l>
<l>What feelings fill my breast,</l>
<l>You would not chide me so,</l>
<l>Your question ne'er had pressed.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>You see no merit, 'tis true,</l>
<l>Couched in this simple line;</l>
<l>Cau's't thou my bosom view?</l>
<l>Dos't know what I opine?</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Thou need'st not at me mock,</l>
<l>Harsh words fright not my heart;</l>
<pb n="10" id="f01609010"/>
<l>I've steeled it as the rock,</l>
<l>Against your poisoned dart.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Leave me to mine own soul,</l>
<l>Take back your words of jest,</l>
<l>And learn that thoughts, though dull,</l>
<l>Are <hi>music</hi> to the breast</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Of him who gave them birth</l>
<l>From out his aching brain;</l>
<l><hi>He</hi> only knows their worth,</l>
<l>Or counts them as his <hi>gain</hi>.</l>
</lg>
<p>&ldquo;Enough! Enough!!, &rdquo;I hear<lb/>
you cry, and I heartily agree<lb/>
with you. I know it would<lb/>
have been more in accord-<lb/>
ance with modesty to have<lb/>
refrained from ver-<lb/>
sification in this<lb/>
letter, especially since<lb/>
you had intimated that I<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01609011"/>
was a poet; but as there were<lb/>
certain meanings which I wished<lb/>
to convey, I have adopted this<lb/>
as the best method by which<lb/>
I could make plain my thoughts,<lb/>
and, at the same time, clearly<lb/>
prove that I am not a poet.<lb/>
Could I believe that you would<lb/>
look upon it as an effort<lb/>
at display, my letter would<lb/>
never be posted. But I have<lb/>
no fears on this point. Nor<lb/>
would I have you think that<lb/>
I have been searching over<lb/>
<add>my</add> store-house and have brought<lb/>
forth the fruit of other days.<lb/>
What I send you in this letter,<lb/>
belongs to the inspiration of<lb/>
the present hour. I do not<lb/>
keep these mementoes of my<lb/>
feelings. I am too wise for that;<lb/>
lest some one would find in<lb/>
them a fitting mark for blighting<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01609012"/>
criticism. I should never have en-<lb/>
trusted my purelide productions<lb/>
to your well-balanced judgement,<lb/>
had I not known that you would<lb/>
be very lenient in your criticism.<lb/>
But my letter is growing volumi-<lb/>
nous and I must hasten its termina-<lb/>
tion. A word about my <hi>dream</hi>, &amp;<lb/>
I am done. What shall I say? &ldquo;My<lb/>
tongue cleaves to the roof of my<lb/>
mouth and my right hand forgets<lb/>
its cunning.&rdquo; The substance of my<lb/>
dream, I dare not tell; of whom I<lb/>
dreamed, I am free to confess, since<lb/>
it was none other than <hi>yourself</hi>.<lb/>
Am I not candid? In return, dis-<lb/>
close the name of the person, of<lb/>
whom you dreamed, for you<lb/>
say it is one in whom I am<lb/>
interested. Who can it be?<lb/>
Praying that your letter will sat-<lb/>
isfy <hi>my</hi> much-awakened curiosity,</p>
<closer>
<salute>I remain, very truly,<lb/>
your friend.</salute>
