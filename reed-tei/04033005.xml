<salute>Dear Mrs. Blakely:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here we are, back in Havana once more,<lb/>
after the most eventful trip I can recall, to God's<lb/>
Country, since I became a tropical tramp some forty<lb/>
years ago. I thought I had a fairly decent mental<lb/>
picture of what our all-out war effort meant on the<lb/>
home front, as we could visualize it from this &ldquo;Gem of<lb/>
the Sea&rdquo;, but I was very far off. A little over a month<lb/>
in God's Country convinced me, as no word picture could,<lb/>
of the profound change in American life and thought that<lb/>
this world conflict has brought about. While I was a<lb/>
patient at Walter Reed Hospital I saw many examples of the<lb/>
cruel results of armed conflict in the maimed and dismember-<lb/>
ed physical wrecks among the youth of our land. It made my<lb/>
heart bleed and left me with an impression so profound that<lb/>
to forget it would be impossible.</p>
<p>By the same token, neither Elida nor your<lb/>
humble servant can ever forget your hospitality and kindness<lb/>
to my better half while se was a guest at the Hostess House<lb/>
over which you preside with such dignity, tact and efficiency.<lb/>
I want you to know that we are both most grateful to you. If,<lb/>
in the coming years, you should decide to visit Cuba, it would<lb/>
indeed be a privilege to reciprocate in part your kindness and<lb/>
consideration to us both during the eleven days I was a patient<lb/>
at the Hospital. Elida has always been timid but from the very<lb/>
first day she lost her timidity with you. Your winning ways,<lb/>
inherent and natural, disarmed her completely.</p>
<p>Please remember us kindly to Miss Louhi, when<lb/>
and as you may see her. She was an excellent disciple of yours.<lb/>
Also, should an opportunity present itself, please remember me<lb/>
to General Marietta.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute>
