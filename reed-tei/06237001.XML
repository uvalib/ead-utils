<p>I am directed by the Surgeon General to acknowledge receipt<lb/>
of your letter of June 15 asking for information with reference to<lb/>
John R. Kissinger, formerly a private, Hospital Corps. U.S. Army.</p>
<p>The records of this office show that John R. Kissinger en-<lb/>
listed in the Hospital Corps. U.S. Army, November 15, 1898, at Indian-<lb/>
apolis, Ind., having previously served in Co. &ldquo;D&rdquo;. of the 157th<lb/>
Indiana Volunteer Infantry.</p>
<p>While serving at Columbia Barracks, Cuba, he volunteered for<lb/>
duty at Camp Lazear, the experimental camp which Major Walter Reed,<lb/>
Surgeon, U.S. Army, the head of US Board for the study of yellow<lb/>
fever had established for the purpose of experimenting in inocula-<lb/>
tion. <hi>He was, from the report of Dr. Reed, the first volunteer to <add>?</add><lb/>
be bitten by an infected mosquito at that camp</hi>. He was first bitten<lb/>
on November 20, 1900, and the result of this bite being negative.<lb/>
was again bitten on December 5th, in consequence of which he suf-<lb/>
fered an attack of yellow fever of moderate severity.</p>
<p>Upon recovery from this attack, he was, for his courageous conduct<lb/>
in this matter promoted Acting Hospital Steward on recommendation of<lb/>
the Chief Surgeon of the Department, and also presented with a gold<lb/>
<unclear>watch</unclear> and chain and a sum of money, by authority of the Military Gov-<lb/>
ernor of Cuba. The gold watch, suitably inscribed, was publicly pre-<lb/>

sented to him by the Chief Surgeon of the Division of Cuba, and in the<lb/>
presence of the Medical Officers and Hospital Corps Detachment at<lb/>
Columbia Barracks. He was also given three months furlough. His<lb/>
application therefor being endorsed by Major Walter Reed as follows:<lb/>
&ldquo;This application meets with my most earnest approval. Acting Hos-<lb/>
pital Steward Kissinger volunteered on November 20, 1900, without<lb/>
hope of any pecuniary reward, but solely for the benefit of humanity<lb/>
and medical science, to be infected by mosquitoes that had purposely<lb/>
been contaminated by biting cases of yellow fever. In this way he<lb/>
contracted, on Dec. 8, 1900, a well pronounced attack of yellow fever<lb/>
from which he is now convalescing. The moral courage exhibited by this<lb/>
soldier in submitting himself to experimentation is unsurpassed in the<lb/>
annals of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer of this letter was associated with these experiments<lb/>
in an <unclear>administrative way, as</unclear> the funds given by General Leonard Wood<lb/>
for <unclear>conducting them was</unclear> placed in his hands for disbursement. As<lb/>
Chief Surgeon of <unclear>the Military</unclear> Department in which the experiments <unclear>were</unclear><lb/>
being conducts, he had also personal knowledge of the facts connected<lb/>
with these experiments and is therefore in a position to state of his<lb/>
personal knowledge that Private Kissinger submitted to these experi-<lb/>
<unclear>&check;</unclear> ments without any expectation or desire for financial reward and the<lb/>
watch and small sum of money (about $100), which was given a number of<lb/>
months afterwards,  was of the nature of a testimonial rather than<lb/>
a reward. His case is a very deserving one and this office hopes<lb/>
that he may receive the financial assistance, of which it is understood<lb/>
he is in great need.</p>
<p>The President of the United States in a special message dated</p>
<p>This statement of Reed's<lb/>
should be publisted in your<lb/>
book as I dont know if<lb/>
has ever been publisted. It<lb/>
clears up the &ldquo;reward&rdquo; claims</p>
<p>The Statement P. 98 Sen. Doc.<lb/>
is too brief.</p>

<p>The White House, Dec. 5, 1906, called the attention of Congress to the<lb/>
propriety of recognizing the services of the men who took part in the<lb/>
yellow fever experiments. His message was printed in Senate Document<lb/>
No. 10, 59th Congress, Second Session.</p>
<p>Mr. Higginson's letter is returned herewith.</p>
