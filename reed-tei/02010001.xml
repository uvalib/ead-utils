</opener>
<p>In compliance with Par. 15 and 16, Special Orders No. 51, Ad-<lb/>
jutant General's Office, March 2, 1900, I have the honor to submit<lb/>
the following report embodying my investigation concerning the prac-<lb/>
tical use of Electrozone in the City of Havana, together with the<lb/>
results of tests made to determine the germicidal value of this<lb/>
fluid.</p>
<p>The plant established in Havana by the Chief Engineer of that<lb/>
Department was put into practical operation during the month of July<lb/>
1899. The method used for the electrolysis of sea water is that<lb/>
known as the Woolf system, and may be briefly described as con-<lb/>
sisting of eight (8) circular, open, wooden vats arranged in pairs<lb/>
and each capable of holding 1000 gallons of sea water. For each<lb/>
of the vats there are provided 52 positive and 53 negative elec-<lb/>
trodes; the former consisting of an alloy of platinum and iridium<lb/>
and the latter of zinc. As stated, these circular vats are con-<lb/>
nected in pairs and both receive, at all times when in operation,<lb/>
the same strength of electric current. For the four pairs of<lb/>
vats, therefore, four dynamos are provided.</p>
<p>These vats having been filled at 7 A.M. with sea water, a cur-<lb/>
rent having a strength normally of 3000 amperes, with a voltage of<lb/>
12-13, is passed through the water for the space of 2 1&sol;2 hours.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02010004"/>
2<lb/>
At the end of this time, 200 gallons (20%) are drawn from each vat<lb/>
and passed into two open wooden receiving tanks which stand on the<lb/>
street below. 200 gallons of sea water are then pumped into each<lb/>
vat to supply the place of that removed, and, at the expiration of<lb/>
30 minutes, 200 gallons are again passed from each vat into the re-<lb/>
ceiving tank. This is repeated throughout the day's run.</p>
<p>It is stated that by this procedure there is produced and main-<lb/>
tained an average strength of 100 grains of available chlorine to<lb/>
the gallon (0.16%) which would appear to be the strength desired.</p>
<p>The plant is, at present, at work <add>during</add> eight hours of the day, turn-<lb/>
ing out, as stated by the Asst. Supt. 24,000 gallons of Electrozone<lb/>
having a strength of 80-100 grains of available chlorine per gal-<lb/>
lon. The capacity of the plant, if run during the 24 hours, is<lb/>
said to be 100,000 gallons, of the strength above indicated.</p>
<p>From the receiving tanks, each of a capacity of 5000 gallons,<lb/>
the disinfectant is drawn off into closed distributing carts at all<lb/>
hours of the day and night, and carried to various parts of the<lb/>
city for sewage, street and household disinfection. I was inform-<lb/>
ed by Col. Black, Chief Engineer, that at present about 12,000 gal-<lb/>
lons are used daily for sewer disinfection and about 8,000 gallons<lb/>
for street sprinkling, those streets being selected for daily sprink-<lb/>
ling which are located in the old part of the city, where yellow<lb/>
fever has been more prevalent during past years.</p>
<p>For the purposes of sewer disinfection, certain water-tight<lb/>
receptacles, having a capacity of several hundred gallons, are pro-<lb/>
vided in connection with the sewers and from these by means of a <unclear>1&sol;2</unclear><lb/>
inch opening a small stream of Electrozone is allowed to flow into<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02010005"/>
3<lb/>
the sewer. By this method, disagreeable odors have been entirely<lb/>
abated and a certain degree of disinfection supposedly obtained.</p>
<p>As regards household disinfection, I was informed by Major W.<lb/>
C. Gorgas, Chief Sanitary Officer, that about 4000 gallons of Elec-<lb/>
trozone were being daily used for the purpose only of cleaning and<lb/>
disinfecting the floors of such houses as were selected for disin-<lb/>
fection, bichloride of mercury solution being relied upon for the<lb/>
disinfection of walls, etc. It will thus be seen that Electrozone<lb/>
is being put to practical use in the city of Havana for three pur-<lb/>
poses, viz: street sprinkling, sewer disinfection and the disinfec-<lb/>
tion of floors.</p>
<p>After a consideration of the germicidal value of this fluid,<lb/>
I will again refer to its use for these several purposes.</p>
<p>I will here state that, at the time of my first visit to the<lb/>
plant, (3 P.M. March 11th) I was impressed with the fact that al-<lb/>
though a certain standard of strength as regards available chlorine<lb/>
was supposed to be obtained, this was not arrived at in actual prac-<lb/>
tice. At my request, the Asst. Supt. kindly tested, by the arse-<lb/>
nious acid test, the fluid contained in two vats; with the result<lb/>
that while one gave .319% of available chlorine, the other contain-<lb/>
ed only .073%. A test of the fluid contained in the two distrib-<lb/>
uting tanks gave for No. 1, .071% of available chlorine, while that<lb/>
contained in tank No. 2 gave .060%. A second test of the fluid<lb/>
contained in tank No. 1, made a half hour later, gave ?142% of a-<lb/>
vailable chlorine.</p>
<p>The varying strength of Electrozone, as regards its available<lb/>
chlorine, will be best shown by the results of the tests that were<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02010006"/>
4<lb/>
made, from time to time, with the fluid contained in the distrib-<lb/>
uting tanks.</p>

</p>
<p>Thus in observations extending over a period of ten days, the<lb/>
amount of available chlorine varied from .142% to .021%, or from<lb/>
82.9 grains to 12.2 g. per gallon. The arsenious acid method was<lb/>
used in determining the available chlorine.</p>
<p>As it will be later shown that the disinfectant value of Elec-<lb/>
trozone depends upon the amount of its available chlorine and that<lb/>
the latter is rapidly lost from the solution, it can be inferred<lb/>
that the fluid in actual daily use must have varied markedly in<lb/>
its disinfectant quality.</p>
<p>Through the courtesy of Col. Black I was enabled on March 20th<lb/>
to make a practical test as to the amount of available chlorine<lb/>
which could be produced by the electrolysis of sea water under the<lb/>
Woolf system, and on March 27th to test the capacity of the entire<lb/>
plant during a three hours' run.</p>
<p>For the first test, one vat only was selected for observation,<lb/>
although, of course, the same strength of chlorine was probably<lb/>
produced in its companion vat, but sufficient time could not be<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02010007"/>

given to the estimation of the strength of both vats. The condi-<lb/>
tions were favorable to the best results, as the electrodes had<lb/>
been thoroughly cleansed and were in good working order. The re-<lb/>
sult of this trial is given in the following table:</p>

</p>
<p>It was observed that during this trial the strength of current<lb/>
supplied to the three remaining pairs of vats varied from 500 to<lb/>
1800 amperes. A test of the fluid in two of these made at 3 P.M.<lb/>
gave only .070% of chlorine. This fluid was being passed into the<lb/>
distributing tanks for general distribution.</p>

</p>
<p>During this trial a heavy rain storm was prevailing, which in-<lb/>
terfered with the filling of two of the vats, and hence the test<lb/>
with these covered a two hours' run only. A small amount of rain<lb/>
water entered the several vats, but not enough, it is believed, to<lb/>
warrant any alteration of figures. On the contrary, the result<lb/>
obtained in set No. 4 was higher than it would otherwise have been<lb/>
owing to a, leakage of about 200 gallons that occurred during the<lb/>
test. So that the results obtained in Sets Nos. 2 and 3 may be<lb/>
taken to fairly represent the capacity of the entire plant during a<lb/>
three hours' run under the most favorable conditions of preparation<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02010010"/>
7<lb/>
therefor. It will be seen that the avilable chlorine obtained<lb/>
amounted to .150% and .170% respectively; in other words, that 8000<lb/>
gallons of Electrozone having a chlorine strength of .160% and 93.47<lb/>
grains per gallon, can be manufactured every three hours, or a pos-<lb/>
sible 24,000 gallons in a nine hours' run.</p>
<p>This result cannot be obtained, however, in the regular course<lb/>
of daily work, since much time must be given especially to cleaning<lb/>
electrodes ; so that practically 2 vats are thrown out of use every<lb/>
fifth day. I believe that it would be more correct to say that the<lb/>
plant can produce during a nine hours' run, 24,000 gallons of Elec-<lb/>
trozone having a strength of .150% or 87.63 grs. of chloride per gl.</p>
<p>I was informed by one of the gentlemen on duty in the Chief<lb/>
Engineer's office, who was present during the test, that theoreti-<lb/>
cally, a current of 3000 amperes should produce 20 grs. of chlorine<lb/>
per gallon per ampere <unclear><del>per</del></unclear> hour. A calculation made at the end of<lb/>
the 3 hours' run showed, however, that only 12 grs. of available<lb/>
chlorine had been obtained per ampere hour.</p>
<p>THE GERMICIDAL VALUE OF ELECTROZONE.</p>
<p>Electrolysed sea water or Electrozone is a clear liquid having<lb/>
a decided odor of chlorine. Its sp. gr. appears to be the same as<lb/>
that of the sea water from which it is made, viz: 1027. It bleach-<lb/>
es both blue and red litmus paper. This effect is brought about<lb/>
more slowly by solutions containing .050% of available chlorine, but<lb/>
takes place at once by solutions having a chlorine strength of .100%<lb/>
to .250%. Its reaction appears to be neutral. Repeated transfers<lb/>
of small quantities of this fluid to nutritive media showed that it<lb/>
was sterile. In order to ascertain how long the current must flow<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02010011"/>
8<lb/>
to bring about the destruction of the bacteria present in sea water,<lb/>
plates on agar were made from the sea water with which the vats<lb/>
were filled at intervals of 5 minutes for the first hour and then<lb/>
at 10 minute intervals during the second hour. The strength of<lb/>
current at the beginning of the observation was 500 A. with 11.5 V.<lb/>
After 5 minutes it had reached a strength of 2500 A., 11.5 V. and<lb/>
after 7 minutes 3000 A., 13.5 V. This strength was thereafter con-<lb/>
tinued during the experiment. The material for plating was taken<lb/>
midway between the electrodes and the edge of the vat and at a depth<lb/>
of about 10 inches. The result obtained is given below:</p>

number of bacteria per cc. of Havana Harbor water was less than had<lb/>
been anticipated, a second observation was made after the lapse of<lb/>
one week. This test gave 2158 colonies to the cc. of sea water,<lb/>

<p>The foregoing observations embraced in tables V to VIII, dem-<lb/>
onstrate that while solutions containing .050% and .100% of availa-<lb/>
ble chlorine possess to a certain extent germicidal qualities, these<lb/>
<pb n="13" id="f02010014"/>
11<lb/>
solutions cannot be considered as efficient disinfectants. In or-<lb/>
der to bring about the more prompt destruction of the test bacte-<lb/>
ria, solutions containing .150% to .250% of available chlorine must<lb/>
be used. It must also be borne in mind that Electrozone is a very<lb/>
unstable preparation, and that it rapidly loses its chlorine con-<lb/>
tent, upon which its germicidal value would appear to depann.<lb/>
This is shown in the following table:</p>
<p><hi>TABLE IX</hi>.</p>

</p>
<p>In the first two observations, the sample of Electrozone was<lb/>
contained in dark colored bottles, tightly closed with a cork stop-<lb/>
per; in the 3d it was contained in a Squibbs chloroform bottle with<lb/>
ground glass stopper and kept in an ice box until re-examined; while<lb/>
in the 4th observation the fluid was purposely left in an open veal.</p>
<p>To what the instability of this preparation is due, even when<lb/>
kept tightly stoppered in vessels, I am unable to state. It may<lb/>
be attributed either to further oxidation of organic matter present<lb/>
in the solution, or more probably to recomposition of the chemical<lb/>
constituents. At any rate, this unstableness of Electrozone is<lb/>
fully appreciated by the officer in charge of the plant, and hence<lb/>
an effort is made to use the fluid as soon after its manufacture as<lb/>
possible. Since, however, it is manufactured in open vats and<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f02010015"/>
12<lb/>
stored in open tanks, it cannot fail to continually lose its chlo-<lb/>
rine strength, and hence to reach its destination with lessened<lb/>
germicidal value.</p>
<p>By reverting now to table I, it will be seen that the strong-<lb/>
est preparation of Electrozone found in the distributing tanks dur-<lb/>
ing a period of 10 days contained .142% of available chlorine, a<lb/>
percentage which was to some extent lessened before its application<lb/>
as a disinfectant. I have already shown that a less chlorine con-<lb/>
tent than .150% cannot be relied upon for prompt disinfection. A<lb/>
solution containing .250% of available chlorine is to be desired.<lb/>
Even a solution of this strength would, after 3 to 6 hours, fall<lb/>
approximately to one containing .200% of chlorine. It follows<lb/>
that the Electrozone heretofore used in Havana has not possessed<lb/>
sufficient chlorine strength to have rendered it an efficient and<lb/>
reliable disinfectant for practical work.</p>
<p>In order to further test the disinfectant value of Electrozone,<lb/>
the following experiments were made:</p>
<p><hi>Experiment I</hi>. Equal parts of Electrozone (.130% chlorine)<lb/>
and a thin watery sewage containing more than 5,000,000 bacteria to<lb/>
each cc. were mixed. An agar plate made with one loop of the mix-<lb/>
ture gave after 1 minute 25 colonies, after 5 minutes 10 colonies,<lb/>
and after 1 hour 4 colonies. A bouillon transfer made after 24<lb/>
hours gave a growth of non-spore-bearing bacilli.</p>
<p><hi>Experiment II</hi>. Equal parts of electrozone )?250% chlorine(<lb/>
and thin sewage were mixed, with the following results: Plate after<lb/>
1&sol;2 minute, 8 colonies. Plate after 2 minutes, 2 colonies. Plate<lb/>
after 30 minutes, 16 colonies. Bouillon transfer after 24 hours<lb/>
gave a growth of non-spore bearing bacilli.</p>
<pb n="15" id="f02010016"/>
<p>13</p>
<p>The foregoing experiments show that while these examples of<lb/>
Electrozone, when mixed in equal parts, did not completely steril-<lb/>
ize the sewage, the number of bacteria were promptly and markedly<lb/>
reduced.</p>
<p><hi>Experiment III</hi>. Electrozone (.150%) chlorine) was mixed with<lb/>
a sample stool in the proportion of 1 part to 1; 2 parts to 1; 3<lb/>
parts to 1 and 4 parts to 1 of the stool. The latter was made by<lb/>
adding 10 grams of solid feces to 30 cc. of urine and the two thor-<lb/>
oughly mixed with a glass rod. Some escape of fine gas bubbles<lb/>
to the surface of the liquid was observed. Plates made after 2,<lb/>
6 and 24 hours gave numbrous colonies of the colon bacillus in all<lb/>
of the mixtures.</p>
<p><hi>Experiment IV</hi>. To a sample stool consisting of 10 grams of<lb/>
feces and 40 cc. of urine, well stirred, were added 150 cc. of Elec-<lb/>
trozone containing .280% of available chlorine. There was prompt<lb/>
evolution of numerous fine gas bubbles which collected as a layer<lb/>
at the surface with temporary bleaching of the amber color of the<lb/>
mixture. A test for the available chlorine in the latter after<lb/>
three hours gave .035%. Plates made after 3, 12 and 24 hours gave<lb/>
numerous colonies.</p>
<p><hi>Experiment V</hi>. Semi-solid feces 10 grams, urine 20 cc. and<lb/>
Electrozone (.370% chlorine) 300 cc., or in the proportion of 10<lb/>
pints of this stronger Electrozone to 1 pint of stool, were mixed.</p>
<p>Bouillon transfers made after 5 minutes, 6 hours and 24 hours gave<lb/>
a good growth. Agar plates made after 16 and 24 hours gave numer-<lb/>
ous colonies of non-spore-bearing bacilli.</p>
<pb n="16" id="f02010017"/>
<p>14</p>
<p>The foregoing experiments would indicate that where there is<lb/>
much organic matter present, and especially in the form of parti-<lb/>
cles of moderate size, the chlorine content of Electrozone (.370%<lb/>
chlorine) is entirely exhausted prior to the complete disinfection<lb/>
of the mixture.</p>
<p>Where, however, this stronger Electrozone is brought in con-<lb/>
tact with thoroughly decomposed fecal matter, the disinfection may<lb/>
be complete after a comparatively short interval, as shown in the<lb/>
following experiments:</p>
<p><hi>Experiment VI</hi>. To a thoroughly decomposed sewage (20,000,000<lb/>
of bacteria to the cc.) consisting of fecal matter 1 part and urine<lb/>
30 pts. was added varying proportions of electrozone (?250% chlo-<lb/>
rine) from 1 to 1 to 6 to 1 of sewage. The solution made with 1<lb/>
pt. of sewage to 5 and 6 parts of Electrozone were rapidly bleached<lb/>
with much frothing. Transfers made to sterile bouillon after two<lb/>
hours interval gave no growth in any of the mixtures.</p>
<p><hi>Experiment VII</hi>. To 1 part of fluid sterile feces, with which<lb/>
a bouillon culture of the typhoid bacillus had afterwards been mix-<lb/>
ed, was added 4 parts of Electrozone (.250% chlorine.) Plates made<lb/>
after 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes showed no colonies. In other words<lb/>
in order that these stronger solutions of Electrozone may bring a-<lb/>
bout the complete disinfection of sewage the organic matter must be<lb/>
in a state of extremely fine suspension, which we do not ordinarily<lb/>
find in the practical disinfection of sewage or stools. In all of<lb/>
the foregoing experiments, although disinfection was not accomplish-<lb/>
ed in the majority, the obnoxious odors of all were promptly sup-<lb/>
pressed by the addition of Electrozone.</p>
<pb n="17" id="f02010018"/>
<p>15</p>
<p>Returning now to the practical use of Electrozone in the City<lb/>
of Havana, I may say that the small quantity allowed to enter the<lb/>
sewers could only act as a deodorizer, and in no sense of the word<lb/>
as a disinfectant. Could the several sewers of the city be filled<lb/>
with this solution and kept full for the period of 24 hours, com-<lb/>
plete disinfection would hardly be accomplished. It is idle then<lb/>
to speak of this agent as a disinfectant for the sewage of the city.</p>
<p>As a surface disinfectant for walls and floors, the stronger<lb/>
solution (.250% to .450% chlorine) will undoubtedly be found effec-<lb/>
tive, but not the weaker solutions heretofore used. For covering<lb/>
the surface of material recently removed from sewers, before it can<lb/>
be carted away, it will acomplish good by surface disinfection and<lb/>
the removal of foul odors.</p>
<p>As regards the matter of street disinfection by sprinkling, it<lb/>
must be remembered that under Col. Black's supervision the streets<lb/>
of Havana, as far as I was able to judge, are kept in a remarkably<lb/>
clean condition and quite free of all surface refuse. Under these<lb/>
circumstances, far more efficient disinfection is effected by direct<lb/>
sunlight than could be expected from the use of any disinfectant<lb/>
solution. Hence I can but think that the sprinkling of streets<lb/>
with Electrozone is entirely superfluous, except for the purpose<lb/>
of allaying dust.</p>
<p>It only remains to compare the disinfectant qualities of Elec-<lb/>
trozone with solutions of other hypochlorites, such as those of so-<lb/>
dium and calcium containing the same equivalent of available chlrn.</p>
<p>Since my return from Havana, I have been engaged in this com-<lb/>
parison, making use of the same method for determining the availa-<lb/>

<p>An examination of the foregoing observations (Tables X-XV)<lb/>
will serve to show that while the solutions of sodium hypochlorite<lb/>
(Labbaraque's solution) of equal chlorine percentage, were just as-<lb/>
effective in germicidal action as Electrozone, the solutions of<lb/>
chlorinated lime were much less efficient in their disinfecting<lb/>
qualities; a solution containing 0.250% of available chlorine re-<lb/>
quiring not less than 10 minutes to destroy staphylococcus pyogenes<lb/>
aureus and 35 minutes to kill anthrax spores.</p>
<p>In seeking an explanation in this marked difference in action<lb/>
between solutions of electrolysed sea water and those of bleaching<lb/>
powder, I think that we must take into consideration the difference<lb/>
in the comparative bleaching action of these two solutions. Elec-<lb/>
trozone bleaches instantly; solutions of chlorinated lime, on the<lb/>
contrary, bleach slowly. In other words, the chlorine content of<lb/>
Electrozone would seem to exist as a very unstable hypochlorite, or<lb/>
as free chlorine, which would account not only for its prompt bleach-<lb/>
ing action, but also for the instability of this fluid. On the<lb/>
other hand, calcium hypochlorite is a more stable compound and gives<lb/>
<pb n="21" id="f02010022"/>
19<lb/>
off its chlorine slowly.</p>
<p>If, however, to the solutions of chlorinated lime there is add-<lb/>
ed a small quantity of an acid, such as dilute hydrochloric acid,<lb/>
so as to set free its chlorine and bring the latter into solution,<lb/>
while still preserving the alkilinity of the fluid, then we find<lb/>
that its bleaching effect is just as prompt as solutions of Elec-<lb/>
<unclear>trozone</unclear>. Not only this, but its germicidal action is just as ef-<lb/>
fective as Electrozone having the same chlorine content.</p>

<p>It will be seen therefore that chloride of lime to which hy-<lb/>
drochloric acid has been added, in the proportion of 40 parts by<lb/>
weight of the acid to 100 parts of lime, has been rendered by the<lb/>
liberation of its chlorine, as effective in disinfectant qualities<lb/>
as Electrozone. As care was taken to preserve the alkalinity of<lb/>
the solution, its germicidal action could not be attributed in any<lb/>
way to free hydrochloric acid, but only to the chlorine remaining<lb/>
in solution as free chlorine.</p>
<p>Since chloride of lime and hydrochloric acid are agents that<lb/>
can be readily <unclear>procuried</unclear> in large quantities and easily stored for<lb/>
use, it does not seem inappropriate to compare the cost of this<lb/>
disinfectant with the cost of Electrozone. The latter preparation,<lb/>
I was informed by Col. Black, was manufactured at a cost of <unclear>1 2<del>1</del>10</unclear><lb/>
mills per gallon; and that to manufacture an electrozone of 0.250%<lb/>
chlorine strength would cost about 2.6 - 2.8 mills per gallon.<lb/>
It must be remembered that in making this estimate no account has<lb/>
been taken of the original cost of the plant, amounting to $75,000,<lb/>
nor of the interest on this sum ($4,500 per annum), nor of<lb/>
<pb n="23" id="f02010024"/>
21<lb/>
the depreciation of the depreciation of the Plant, generally com-<lb/>
puted at 10% per annum. Only the actual daily operating expenses<lb/>
<unclear>)</unclear>$37.00 per day) have been considered.</p>
<p>It is believed that the following calculations will closely<lb/>
approximate the relative cost of chlorinated lime and Electrozone<lb/>
as disinfectants:</p>
<p>To</p>
<p>
<table rows="2" cols="2">

</p>
<p>7000 grains of chloride of lime containing 35%, or 2450 grains of<lb/>
available chlorine, would make 16.78 gallons of a disinfectant,<lb/>
having a strength of 0.250% or 146 grains of chloride per gallon.<lb/>
Deducting 1.78 gallons as loss of chlorine in making the prepara-<lb/>
tions, we have:</p>

</p>
<p>or at a cost of 3.17 mills per gallon, or for 24,000 gallons a cost<lb/>
of $76.08 per diem.</p>
<p>Since July 1, 1899, to March 31, 1900- 234 working days- the<lb/>
total expenditure would have been $17,802.00 for sufficient chlo-<lb/>
ride of lime and hydrochloric acid to have supplied a disinfectant<lb/>
having 146 grains of available chlorine per gallon.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have the following:</p>
<p>

22<lb/>
supplying daily for 234 working days 24,000 gallons of Electrozone,<lb/>
having no particular standard of strength as regards available<lb/>
chlorine, but certainly of a less strength (see table I) than .150%.</p>
<p>It seems fair to conclude therefore, that had the ganitary, au-<lb/>
thorities of Havana resprted to chloride of lime as the disinfect-<lb/>
ant, instead of Electrozone, the work of disinfection would have<lb/>
been more thoroughly carried out and the Insular funds would have<lb/>
been richer by sixty nine thousand, two hundred and thirty one dol-<lb/>
lars ($69,231)</p>
