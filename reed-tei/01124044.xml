<salute>Dear Doctor:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I desire to make a statement concerning the case of Jas. E.<lb/>
Roudabush, a consular passenger, whom we were forced to take on board ship<lb/>
at Puerto Barrios by the American Consul against both the will of the Cap-<lb/>
tain and myself. Upon examining patient I saw he was physically unfit to<lb/>
make voyage, although he had no temperature and gave no history of any past<lb/>
illness. A small macular lesion was noted on glans penis at junction of<lb/>
mucus membrane with gland which made me suspicious of venereal disease.<lb/>
Patient was rejected for passage and Purser carried him back to American<lb/>
Consul, who said we must either carry patient or ship would be fined. So<lb/>
patient was placed in room to himself on aft deck where he was treated and<lb/>
taken care of until he was removed from ship in Havana; the patient being<lb/>
in more or less of a stupor all the time, I was unable to get any satis-<lb/>
factory history from him, which made the diagnosis of the case all the more<lb/>
complicated. It was only the last day while on board the ship that patient<lb/>
told me he had fever eleven days and diarrhea five days before leaving<lb/>
Barrios. At no time during the three days' voyage from Barrios to Havana<lb/>
did patient's temperature go over 99 1/2 except evening of arrival at Havana<lb/>
it registered 101.</p>
<p>His pulse was always very weak and rapid, registering from 110 to<lb/>
144. He had a lethargic facial expression and his skin a yellowish lemon-<lb/>
like color, becoming a deeper yellow each day. There was an incontinence<lb/>
of urine and feces. Upon pressure over the abdomen there was severe pain<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01124045"/>
- 2 -<lb/>
over entire bowels, but no masses were felt. There was no nausea or vomiting<lb/>
until last day of voyage. As to treatment, I gave very little medicine as I<lb/>
thought patient's condition was one where comfort and supportive measures<lb/>
should be used instead of drugs. Quinine was administered the second day as<lb/>
was a mixture of paregoric and bismuth to check the diarrhea. Cold fruit<lb/>
drinks and ice cream was given patient as nourishment in hopes that he would<lb/>
gain strength.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Havana our ship was quarantined for two hours while<lb/>
it was being decided as to what disposition would be made of patient. Our<lb/>
agent at Havana had him removed from ship to Las Animos Hospital at seven<lb/>
o'clock, P. M., and we were informed that he died at eigh thirty o'clock<lb/>
same evening, cause of death being given as malarial fever.</p>
<p>Assuring you that every attention was accorded Jas. A. Roudabush<lb/>
that was possible while he was ill upon this vessel, I beg to remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>

Ship's Doctor</signed>.
