<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Miss Brown and I have put in another very satisfactory<lb/>
week's work--not our customary seven-day-week, however, as, for the<lb/>
first time since our association, we spent the week-end out of town, in<lb/>
Virginia. I feel that this brief experience of &ldquo;out of doors&rdquo; sho<del>i</del><add>u</add>ld be<lb/>
of benefit to the book as well as to ourselves.</p>
<p>We had a piece of <hi>very</hi> good luck this week in the arrival of<lb/>
another copy of Villalba's epidemiology at the Library of the Surgeon Gener<lb/>
al. Mr. Neumann had ordered a duplicate copy as soon as it seemed use-<lb/>
less to search longer for the missing one, but none of us had any idea<lb/>
that his correspondent in Spain could get hold of a copy so quickly, as<lb/>
they are said to be very rare. The edition just received is not the<lb/>
same as the one <add>that</add> Father consulted, but I doubt if there be much difference.<lb/>
Mr. Neumann also very kindly called us up at the Library of Congress as<lb/>
soon as the book was received, reserving it for us in the interim. We<lb/>
are &ldquo;digging in&rdquo; on Villalba then in order to let Dr. Frost have the veri-<lb/>
fied references as soon as possible. I am delighted at the arrival of<lb/>
this book before Father's MS goes to press, as we have been able to find<lb/>
no reference to any copy in America save the missing one at t<del>j</del><add>h</add>e Surgeon<lb/>
General's Library.</p>
<p>Most of our remaining work is being done at the Library of Con-<lb/>
gress amd at my apartment, but we still ha<del>b</del><add>v</add>e a table at the Library of t<del>j</del><add>h</add>e<lb/>
Surgeon General and, as in the present instance, the co-operation and help<lb/>
<add>there</add> given us could be secured nowhere else. Also, I am glad for the sake of<lb/>
its staff that we could get through the very large mass of literatire we<lb/>
went over there when they were less busy than they are now after <del>tje</del><add>the</add> op-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0322066"/>
-2-<lb/>
workers.</p>
<p>It was delightful to get a glimpse of you S<del>im</del><add>un</add>day night, only<lb/>
I wish it had not had to be such a brief one. I hoped against hope<lb/>
that you might have a spare moment before you left Washington and<lb/>
shall continue to hope for better luck next time. It seemed very nat<del>i</del><add>u</add>ral<lb/>
to see you here, reminding me of the wonderful talks between yourself<lb/>
and Father to which I was priveleged to listen, and of all that our as-<lb/>
sociation with yourself and the Foundation meant to both of us.</p>
<closer>
<salute>With very best wishes, I remain<lb/>
Most truly yours,</salute>

<seg>
P. S. Your letter of November 12th. <del>j</del><add>h</add>as just reached me. It was very<lb/>
thoughtful of you to remember my troubles about Villalba, but the arrival<lb/>
of the copy from Spain will, I feel sure, put an end to our difficulties im<lb/>
that line. We're going to have a splendid bibliography when we get through<lb/>
and, thank Heaven! the bulk of it is done, though there are still some<lb/>
things I am very anxious to clear up. Villalba was one of our main dif-<lb/>
ficulties, however, so I trust he is an <unclear>omen</unclear> as to the rest!<lb/>
