ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been away on a vacation and have just<lb/>
read your letter of January 22nd. I had a package of<lb/>
&ldquo;Mile Posts&rdquo; which I had put away and which I am sending<lb/>
you under separate cover. I understand that no Alumni<lb/>
Bulletins are available. I think there are about fifty<lb/>
booklets in the package I am sending you and hope they<lb/>
will help you in what you are trying to do.</p>
<p>Our film turned out fairly well. If you wish,<lb/>
I will be glad to send it to you so that you can see the<lb/>
parts I had copied from still pictures. It was my inten-<lb/>
tion to have some extra footage made for you but either<lb/>
no extra footage was made or the extra footage was used<lb/>
in the film. I did not put it together myself. If you<lb/>
want to see it, you could indicate what scenes you would<lb/>
like to have and I will have them made for you. Scenes<lb/>
in the film were taken by quite a number of persons and<lb/>
some of them are not good, but since it is all we have<lb/>
I had them included. It makes a fairly good historical<lb/>
record, nevertheless.</p>
<p>I am glad to read your remarks about the<lb/>
&ldquo;special edition&rdquo;. After we received your wire I was a<lb/>
little apprehensive less you were made too uncomfortable.<lb/>
Consequently, I am glad you had a laugh out of it. I<lb/>
realize that I will have to be on my guard for what may<lb/>
happen.</p>
<p>With best wishes, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
