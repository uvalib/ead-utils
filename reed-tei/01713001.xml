<salute>My own, little darling;</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is eve-<lb/>
ning ere I begin my letter,<lb/>
but you must not, on that<lb/>
account, darling, suppose<lb/>
that I have forgotten the<lb/>
promise to write you<lb/>
punctually, which I made<lb/>
when I left. The reason I<lb/>
did not write, this morning,<lb/>
was due to the fact that, on<lb/>
arriving, at the Point, I found<lb/>
a letter from an acquain-<lb/>
tance in Brooklyn, stating<lb/>
that his wife was quite<lb/>
sick &amp; urgently requesting<lb/>
me to call, at once. Although<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01713002"/>
much exhausted in body &amp;<lb/>
mind, I went down, as<lb/>
soon as I had finished<lb/>
my Breakfast &amp; did not<lb/>
return till after six o'clk<lb/>
this evening. You can easily<lb/>
imagine, at the present time,<lb/>
that I do not feel very<lb/>
much refreshed, after my ad-<lb/>
ditional journey of to-day-<lb/>
Still I cannot, nor will I<lb/>
close my eyes without writ-<lb/>
ing a few words to my own<lb/>
little love. As I wrote you<lb/>
on Saturday night, I did not<lb/>
make connection at Baltimore<lb/>
with the New York Train, and<lb/>
hence had to spend the day<lb/>
in Baltimore. I went to Bar-<lb/>
num's Hotel &amp; was agreeably<lb/>
surprised to find that it<lb/>
was a very elegant Hotel,<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01713003"/>
with a very enticing Bill<lb/>
of Fare, to which I paid<lb/>
my very best respects. I<lb/>
took quite a jaunt over<lb/>
the City before dinner &amp;<lb/>
was much more favorably<lb/>
impressed with the extent<lb/>
&amp; beauty <add>of the town</add> than on any pre-<lb/>
vious visit- Indeed, it <add>is</add> a<del>s</del><lb/>
very much larger city than<lb/>
I had supposed &amp; has<lb/>
some very pretty streets-<lb/>
And much to my surprise,<lb/>
in conversing with a gen-<lb/>
tleman, who resides there, I<lb/>
find that rents &amp; <add>expenses of</add> living<lb/>
are quite moderate. In fact<lb/>
rents are very much cheap-<lb/>
er than in the little town<lb/>
of Norfolk- So that when<lb/>
we do finally conclude to<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01713004"/>
resign our commissions<lb/>
&amp; tell &ldquo;uncle Sam&rdquo; goodbye,<lb/>
we will certainly give the<lb/>
preference to Baltimore-<lb/>
After my walk, I found it<lb/>
necessary to refresh myself<lb/>
with sleep, as I had ob-<lb/>
tained but very little during<lb/>
my trip up the Bay- So, even<lb/>
after retiring, it was long<lb/>
before I could slumber, so<lb/>
much was I thinking of you,<lb/>
my own, sweet Emilie. And<lb/>
when I did, at last, fall asleep,<lb/>
<del>I</del> it was but to dream of<lb/>
you. Oh! what would I not<lb/>
give, this night, to see your<lb/>
darling face! All, all that<lb/>
I possess- Pardon this short<lb/>
note, but I am so fatigued, I can<lb/>
write no more- Will write again,<lb/>
on Thursday.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Ever, your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
