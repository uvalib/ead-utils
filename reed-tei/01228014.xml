<salute>Dear La-u-ra:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciate more than I can tell you the time and<lb/>
pains you take to write me concerning your father. Your letter,<lb/>
however, brought mixed feelings, for I am greatly distressed to<lb/>
discover that he is suffering and has lost ground.</p>
<p>I look back with much satisfaction on our trip last<lb/>
summer, when he received in part personal recognition for the<lb/>
distinguished services and contributions he has made to mankind,<lb/>
but one of the joys of life is to feel that I have had a place<lb/>
in the friendships of your father's great heart. As you know,<lb/>
I have always had the highest admiration for his nobility of<lb/>
character, as well as his extraordinary habit of mind. I know<lb/>
no one whose mental processes were so alert, so keen, so crit-<lb/>
ical, and whose judgments were so sure and logic so convincing.<lb/>
His personality surrounded him as an aura which had a particular<lb/>
appeal to me, and I recall almost verbatim certain conversations<lb/>
which were both stimulating and inspiring.</p>
<p>I did not start this letter with the intention of<lb/>
writing a eulogy, but these thoughts just naturally come out,<lb/>
and I am always glad to give them voice. I was in Washington<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01228015"/>
2<lb/>
Sunday and saw Mrs. Goldberger and Mrs. McCoy, and learned<lb/>
from them that things were not going well. I would have<lb/>
stopped in, but was advised not to do so in view of all the<lb/>
circumstances. If, however, I can be of any service at any<lb/>
time, command me and you know I will gladly serve.</p>
<p>My wife joins me in everything.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>

Miss Laura Armistead Carter,<lb/>
2212 Columbia Street, N. W.,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
I wrote this letter this morning - now comes your<lb/>
telegram which tells of the end. Death is a shock<lb/>
even though it is a release - I feel that I<lb/>
have suffered a personal loss, but what must<lb/>
your feelings be. My words cannot <unclear>assurge</unclear> your<lb/>
grief - How you will miss <unclear>these</unclear> noble soul.<lb/>
I wish I could be of some use. Tell me.<lb/>
With best of love<lb/>
M. M.<lb/>
