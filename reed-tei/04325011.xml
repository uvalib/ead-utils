<p>Hench will send Siler a large number of reprints of his paper on Reed, to be distributed at military medical facilities. He suggests small changes in the inscription for the plaque memorializing Reed's place of death. Hench is delighted that a bill has been introduced in Congress to honor Reed.</p>

Colonel J. F. Siler<lb/>
1835 Eye Street N.W.<lb/>
Washington 6, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Siler:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am very sorry not to have sent to Walter Reed Hospital the<lb/>
copies of the yellow fever story. Somehow I thought we had done that<lb/>
but in checking up on matters, I find that I sent a supply to General<lb/>
Kean's son. I recall some weeks ago having a letter from someone at<lb/>
Walter Reed requesting a number of reprints, or maybe it was a letter<lb/>
from you.</p>
<p>The reason I am so confused in the matter is that for ten weeks<lb/>
I have been keeping away from my desk, working very hard trying to finish<lb/>
a detailed report of our recent work and I am far behind in my correspon-<lb/>
dence. I do have a fairly large supply of these reprints and will, within<lb/>
the next few days, send you 500 or 600 copies.</p>
<p>I think the inscription for the plaque is quite satisfactory.<lb/>
It is very simple and of course necessitates a knowledge of the reader<lb/>
as to who Walter Reed was. I suppose that anything else in <unclear>superfluous</unclear><lb/>
but I wondered whether a slight addition might be appropriate: &ldquo;Walter<lb/>
Reed, the <unclear>Conquoror</unclear> of Yellow Fever, died....&rdquo; or something like this:<lb/>
&ldquo;Walter Reed, great physician and benefactor of mankind, died...&rdquo;<lb/>
You will see what I mean and whatever you and the other members and<lb/>
General Kean decide is quite all right with me. The trouble is that<lb/>
although a certain segment of the world knows Walter Reed, I imagine that to<lb/>
even a lot of the new members of the enlisted Army he is merely a name and<lb/>
they probably don't even know he was a physician.</p>
<p>I do hope that you have completely recovered.</p>
<p>I am delighted to know that a bill has been introduced in Congress<lb/>
to memorialize Walter Reed. If there is anything I can do to help along,<lb/>
be sure to let me know. If there is a special hearing on this and my voice<lb/>
is needed. I shall try to help but I imagine the matter is in excellent hands<lb/>
and everyone in Congress knows who Walter Reed was.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Always Sincerely,</salute>
