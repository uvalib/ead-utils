Proposed Polyclinic at<lb/>
Akron, Ohio.<lb/>
/LC<lb/>
<dateline>
<date value="1919-08-06">August 6, 1919.</date>
</dateline>
Dr. Edwin C. Shaw,<lb/>
533 <unclear>Second</unclear> National Building,<lb/>
Akron, Ohio.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Shaw:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In answer to your letter of August 1/19, received to-day,<lb/>
I would say</p>
<p>(1) As to the desireability of the proposed Polyclinic:<lb/>
There is no question as to the advantage of concentrating medical<lb/>
relief into one place except (a) for towns so large that parts of<lb/>
them are too distant from any one place for all people to conve-<lb/>
niently come to it and (b) where there is some industrial, or<lb/>
other, establishment, which requires a special place of relief ad-<lb/>
jacent to itself. If neither of these conditions obtain at Akron,<lb/>
a concentration of the different kinds of sick-relief is advisable--<lb/>
possibly obstetrical relief may be an exception.</p>
<p>(2) As to the practicability of the proposed Polyclinic, I<lb/>
do not know enough as to the conditions a<hi rend="superscript">+</hi> Akron to answer.</p>
<p>The use of a clinical clerk for the routine history and a<lb/>
stenographer for the (physician's) special questioning and the find-<lb/>
ings of his examinations will greatly lessen the time of the medi-<lb/>
cal examinations. In general physicians are willing to give a mod-<lb/>
erate amount of their time for strictly professional work of the<lb/>
kind that (as I understand) you propose at this Polyclinic, without<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00818102"/>
-2-<lb/>
charge. That matter, however, is to be settled locally. If you<lb/>
take in pay patients, physicians should be paid. The Manager of<lb/>
the institution, naturally, should be paid.</p>
<p>The addition of a dispensary where medicines are furnished<lb/>
and hospital accomodations for such patients as need them will pre-<lb/>
vent the work from being limited to diagnosis. If it be impracti-<lb/>
cable--it may well be--to concentrate the hospital relief of Akron<lb/>
at one place, it may be practicable to make arrangements for such<lb/>
hospitals as you have to receive as patients from the Polyclinic<lb/>
such as need hospital relief.</p>
<p>The concentration of the services of the different medical and<lb/>
surgical specialists at one place should be an unending advantage to<lb/>
the sic and, I am sure, an advantage to the physicians as well.<lb/>
This is what is arrived at at the large hospitals of the larger cities.</p>
<p>With best wishes for the success of whatever plan you agree on,<lb/>
I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
Assistant Surgeon General H. R. Carter,<lb/>
U. S. Marine Hospital,<lb/>
Baltimore, Md.<lb/>
