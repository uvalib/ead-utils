<title>Letter from Thurman B. Rice to Philip Showalter Hench, April 13, 1948</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>In connection with Hench's efforts to learn more about Reed's 1900 Indianapolis lecture, Rice sends Hench a list of hotels in the city at that date. He also encloses a letter from Rice to Fletcher Hodges, a friend and long-time Indianapolis resident, which includes Hodges' reply to Rice. Hodges has crossed out some of the hotels on the list.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Enclosed you will find a <xref id="f04214032">list</xref> of hotels to be found in Indianapolis<lb/>
as of 1900. The list was prepared by the reference department of<lb/>
the Indianapolis Public Library. Also you will find a <xref id="f04214022">letter</xref> which<lb/>
I wrote to a physician friend of mine who lived in Indianapolis from<lb/>
the time of his birth and was a young man in 1900. He came from a<lb/>
very old and prominent family and was in position to know more about<lb/>
the subject matter under discussion than anyone I know. You will<lb/>
note the note which he has written at the bottom of my own letter.</p>
<p>He tells me and I think that he is quite correct in all probability,<lb/>
that the hotels which he has marked out are clearly out of the ques-<lb/>
tion. Those that he checked are rather prominent hotels. There is<lb/>
one instance where he has put one check mark over two names, the<lb/>
Hotel English and the Hotel Oneida. I think probably that he meant<lb/>
for the check to be after the Hotel English. I am inclined to think<lb/>
that he meant to draw a line through the Hotel Oneida and just neg-<lb/>
lected to do so. I believe I am correct when I say that the Oneida<lb/>
was somewhat questionable. Maybe that is because I am associating<lb/>
the name of the hotel with the communistic and rather free love com-<lb/>
munity of Oneida, New York, of those times. The name Oneida as late<lb/>
as 1900 was somewhat associated with free love sex colonies and so I<lb/>
doubt if it was considered a high class hotel at that time. I might<lb/>
be entirely wrong in this thinking.</p>
<p>Every one of the hotels which he has checked has long since gone the<lb/>
way of all the earth with the exception of the Hotel English, and I<lb/>
understand it is rather soon to be torn down. I would be strongly in-<lb/>
clined to doubt if the register lists have been preserved that far back,<lb/>
or would be available. You might try the English Hotel, however. Almost<lb/>
certainly the register lists of all the others are lost.</p>
<p>I shall be very happy if this has been of any use to you. I assure you<lb/>
that you will be quite welcome to the use of the cut showing the room<lb/>
in which Walter Reed read his paper. We did have an original photo-<lb/>
graph and we might find it again, or I suppose we might find one from<lb/>
another source. I shall continue to be on the lookout for it.</p>
