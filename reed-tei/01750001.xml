<salute>My own precious wifie, dear;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yesterday, I received<lb/>
two sweet, but unsatisfactory letters from my<lb/>
little lovie, or at least <hi>one</hi> of them left out<lb/>
some information which I very much de-<lb/>
-sired to get- What kind of a darling little<lb/>
woman are you, any how, my lovie? But<lb/>
I will explain all. In your letter of July<lb/>
31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> you tell me that you have heard from<lb/>
your necklace, but that it had not arrived-<lb/>
In your darling letters of Aug. 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; aug. 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
you don't say one word about your neck-<lb/>
lace having arrived, so of course I concluded<lb/>
that my little darling hadn't got it yet;<lb/>
and this made <add>me</add> very uneasy lest my lovie<lb/>
had lost it in the mails, &amp; I well knew<lb/>
how great her disappointment would be.<lb/>
This being the case, I went, at once, to the<lb/>
telegraph office &amp; informed Mr Lucas that<lb/>
up to Aug. 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, nothing had been heard<lb/>
from the necklace and that it was probably<lb/>
lost, &amp; asked him to please investigate through<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01750002"/>
the Post Office Department. Lo! &amp; behold, this mor-<lb/>
ning, when I met Mrs Harrison, she greeted me<lb/>
with, &ldquo;Well Doctor, I heard from Mrs. Reed, yes-<lb/>
-terday, &amp; she is very much pleased with her<lb/>
necklace-&rdquo; Of course, lovie, this surprised me<lb/>
very agreeably, &amp; on looking at the letter, I found<lb/>
it dated august 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, the very same day on<lb/>
which you wrote to your old mantee, and<lb/>
stranger still, this afternoon, I got a tele-<lb/>
gram from Mr Lucas, in reply, stating that<lb/>
you acknowledged its receipt <hi>august 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi></hi><lb/>
&amp;were much pleased. Now, lovie, dear, after<lb/>
all this, old mantee almost feels hurt,<lb/>
that his little wifie should tell others about<lb/>
her necklace, yet she has neglected to write<lb/>
him one word about it- I'll really have<lb/>
to give you a good whipping, my precious<lb/>
wifie, if you treat me this way again- You<lb/>
told Mrs. H. that you had sent me a pat-<lb/>
-tern of the necklace, but as it was not<lb/>
in the letter of august 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> or 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, I guess<lb/>
my little wifie forgot all about it. I'll<lb/>
have to excuse you, this time, Emilie, lovie,<lb/>
but if you do not acknowledge the re-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01750003"/>
ceipt of the two checks I have sent you,<lb/>
I shall certainly think that you have lost<lb/>
all interest in your poor old Arizona<lb/>
&ldquo;hubby-&rdquo; Now, my darling wifie, as I am<lb/>
pretty sure that you have forgotten to<lb/>
say anything about the checks, please, on<lb/>
receipt of this, sit down &amp; acknowledge them<lb/>
if you only write a dozen lines- I am<lb/>
so glad that the necklace came to hand<lb/>
safely, my darling wifie, and that you consider<lb/>
it so pretty. I have given myself many<lb/>
moments of uneasiness about it, during<lb/>
the past week, and was afraid that <add>if</add> you ever<lb/>
did get it, that it would not please you;<lb/>
that is, providing it is the same pattern<lb/>
as Mr Mills; although I must confess that<lb/>
on a second &amp; third sight of it, each time<lb/>
it looks prettier- Now I &ldquo;finks&rdquo; I have given<lb/>
my little wifie a real good scolding for<lb/>
treating her mantee so, and love her heart,<lb/>
I guess the truth of the matter is that<lb/>
she wrote her dear old mantee a letter<lb/>
which never came, explaining all; and &ldquo;pec&rdquo;<lb/>
she &ldquo;knowledged the old tecks too&rdquo; if so,<lb/>
lovie, dear, all &ldquo;Ise dot&rdquo; to say is &ldquo;<hi>Boodigs-</hi>&rdquo;!<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01750004"/>
Poor, little precious, I &ldquo;pec&rdquo; she is sad enough,<lb/>
even though she has got her present, at<lb/>
the long time her old mantee must stay in<lb/>
Arizona, and I shouldn't be much surprised to<lb/>
see a lovely little woman, with wings, come<lb/>
sailing over the Rocky mountains with a small<lb/>
boy strapped to her back, &ldquo;a la Indian&rdquo;, &amp; alight<lb/>
in the centre of the parade. You know you<lb/>
said, my darling wifie, that if I didn't come till next<lb/>
spring, that you would <hi>fly</hi> to old Arizona- Now<lb/>
lovie, dear, abandon at once all thoughts of<lb/>
returning to this dreadfully isolated territory-<lb/>
Doesn't my own little darling remember when<lb/>
we were accomplishing that tedious, weary,<lb/>
old journey to Otero that &ldquo;hubby&rdquo; asked her<lb/>
if she could ever be induced to return to<lb/>
Arizona and that she forcibly replied, <hi>&ldquo;Never&rdquo;!</hi><lb/>
Well I guess you would now say, my<lb/>
lovie, &ldquo;<hi>hardly ever</hi>&rdquo;! But mantee knows how<lb/>
much happier &amp; more comfortable his precious<lb/>
wife &amp; son will be at home than here, and<lb/>
he has made up his mind on the subject,<lb/>
and now only looks forward to next May, as<lb/>
the time when he will fold his tents &amp;<lb/>
steal to his little darling's arms. <hi>August</hi><lb/>

Page 4 -- is about passed &amp; there are only left<lb/>
4 months to Jan. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. Then I shall employ in<lb/>
diligent study, both of Spanish &amp; of my pro-<lb/>
-fession, for it is very probable that I<lb/>
will get my 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Examination soon after my<lb/>
return East, and I don't propose to be caught<lb/>
napping -- my precious wifie must spend her<lb/>
time in visiting friends &amp; painting &ldquo;pretties&rdquo;, and<lb/>
<hi>playing on the piano</hi>! Now, love your heart, I<lb/>
&ldquo;finks&rdquo; you are the sweetest, brightest little<lb/>
&ldquo;oomsey&rdquo; that ever lived! In your letter to Mantee<lb/>
you said that <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>40 was no inducement, as all<lb/>
the <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>133 was yours -- and that was very true &amp;<lb/>
very &ldquo;feetning&rdquo;; but bless my life, in Mrs. H's.<lb/>
letter, I find that my little precious is hard<lb/>
at work, just &ldquo;pawing the ivories&rdquo; -- all of which<lb/>
is <hi>just too sweet</hi> for anything! Trying to steal<lb/>
a march on ugly old mantee, as usual, &amp;<lb/>
caught in the attempt. &ldquo;<hi>Boodigs</hi>&rdquo;! by the<lb/>
dozen, lovie! Well since you <hi>have</hi> begun,<lb/>
&amp; now have such an excellent opportunity,<lb/>
please, lovie, dear, do persevere &amp; learn to<lb/>
play something for your old mantee, and he<lb/>
will give you more than <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>40, a month, and<lb/>
you will never have to have any more<lb/>
little girls &amp; boys; or rather I should say,<lb/>
&ldquo;hardly ever&rdquo;! &ldquo;Boodigs&rdquo;, lovie, by the <hi>quart</hi>!<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01750006"/>
You perceive, my precious wifie, that I am<lb/>
entirely conversant with &ldquo;pinafore&rdquo; and so are<lb/>
&ldquo;his sisters &amp; his cousins &amp; his aunts&rdquo;. By the way,<lb/>
you never told me what you thought of the<lb/>
performance you saw in Washington. Did it<lb/>
come up to your expectations, and make my<lb/>
prettie lovie shake her &ldquo;ittle wibs&rdquo; with laughter?<lb/>
Won't you have an opportunity of wit-<lb/>
-nessing theatrical performances in Norfolk<lb/>
this winter?- I am sorry that Mrs. Vaughan will<lb/>
go down to the city so early in the Fall; and<lb/>
think it would be wise for you, my dar-<lb/>
-ling, to remain at Grand-ma Reed's till<lb/>
the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> or Middle of October. But suit Yourself.<lb/>
Tuesday, aug. 26- As I begin to write, my lovie,<lb/>
I hear the shrill bark, oft repeated, of a<lb/>
squirrel chirping away for dear life in<lb/>
the Ca&ntilde;on abaft the edifice- Don't you re-<lb/>
member how mantee and old &ldquo;spin up the<lb/>
Creek&rdquo; used to quietly steal down &amp; peep<lb/>
over the edge of the rocks and catapompher-<lb/>
-icate the festive squirrel as he pensively<lb/>
lay on the boulder, dreaming sweet dreams<lb/>
of Captain Adam's pigeon-box? And how<lb/>
we used to bring them home &amp; skin them<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01750007"/>
and eat them for breakfast? Ah! the second<lb/>
joint of the juicy leg of the squirrel is a<lb/>
savory morsel to the palate that daily<lb/>
feeds on bovine flesh! Beef, my dear<lb/>
wife, still holds its supreme sway <add>at</add><lb/>
Fort Apache, unchallenged by the modest<lb/>
mutton or winsome pork- Indeed, I would<lb/>
walk all the way to Turkey Creek Hill, to-day,<lb/>
as hot as it is, to just have the pleasure<lb/>
of wrapping my tongue about a piece of<lb/>
nice sugar-cured, juicy ham! The Com-<lb/>
missary containeth none of the latter, and but<lb/>
few other things that tempt an appete. Dr<lb/>
McP. &amp; I were just saying, this morning, that<lb/>
we would have to haul over our rods &amp; lines<lb/>
&amp; tempt the wary trout from his summer<lb/>
lair. <del>Perhaps</del>, Now that W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>, the conqueror,<lb/>
alias, old &ldquo;swing on the pivot&rdquo;, has been re-<lb/>
-lieved as Quartermaster &amp; Lt. Kingsbury<lb/>
appointed, perhaps affairs commissarian<lb/>
&amp; quartermasterian, will be better regula-<lb/>
-ted- In fact the late 2.M. with the alder-<lb/>
manic stomach &amp; the blouse <hi>too short aft</hi>,<lb/>
was inclined to be too <hi>desidiose</hi> to be a<lb/>
very successful Quartermaster. Come, haul down<lb/>

Page 4 -- is about passed &amp; there are only left<lb/>
4 months to Jan. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. Then I shall employ in<lb/>

<pb n="9" id="f01750009"/>
Page 9. Well, my little lovie, I have never<lb/>
been so completely knocked down the<lb/>
&ldquo;back-stairs&rdquo;, so to speak, as I was by<lb/>
the news that you, my precious, were <hi>lear-<lb/>
-ning</hi> to <hi>dance</hi>! &ldquo;I <hi>never</hi> did&rdquo;! or rather &ldquo;<hi>hardly</hi>,<lb/>
ever&rdquo;! why what can have &ldquo;<hi>awakened</hi>&rdquo; you?<lb/>
I certainly can't tell, unless it be that you<lb/>
have, at last, come to the conclusion that dan-<lb/>
-cing, (especially square dances) is not very dif-<lb/>
-ficult to learn &amp; is quite useful, at times,<lb/>
in helping to pass away the time- Although I<lb/>
am <hi>very glad</hi> to hear that you are really<lb/>
&ldquo;tipping the light fantastic,&rdquo; yet what surprises<lb/>
me is that Ma Reed doesn't interfere and break<lb/>
up your performances- I always did know that<lb/>
my pretty little wifie <hi>could</hi> dance, if she would<lb/>
only try, but mantee never could get you<lb/>
to skip around with him. And papa's boy<lb/>
dances too! Love his precious life, papa<lb/>
is delighted to hear that he continues <add>so</add><lb/>
well &amp; is improving so rapidly in talking.<lb/>
I can hardly bring myself to believe that<lb/>
he can really <hi>talk</hi>- Why, he will be such<lb/>
a <hi>big</hi> boy by the time that papa comes,<lb/>
that old &ldquo;bad daddies&rdquo; &amp; papa won't know<lb/>
each other- Give him a hundred kisses every<lb/>
day for me, my sweet Emilie, &amp; talk to him often<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01750010"/>
of his absent papa- Let him play with<lb/>
the pretty apples, mama, but don't let him<lb/>
eat the green ones- Have you any fruit<lb/>
this summer, at Harrisonburg, my lovie?<lb/>
I do hope that you will get a chance<lb/>
at a plenty of peaches, apples &amp; other<lb/>
nice fruits -- and of the nice &ldquo;skip-along&rdquo;<lb/>
grapes in Murfreesboro, during the late<lb/>
fall- You must eat some of those for your<lb/>
poor old mantee- He thought the little<lb/>
flower that his little darling sent was<lb/>
mighty sweet &amp; that it was very loving in<lb/>
his precious wifie to send it- He had fully<lb/>
intended to send a nice pretty <hi>pink</hi> mor-<lb/>
-ning glory for his little <hi>pink</hi> of a lovie,<lb/>
but when he went out, this morning, they had<lb/>
every one closed &amp; withered- But a pretty one<lb/>
shall come in his next- The rainy season is<lb/>
about over, lovie, &amp; the hot sun dries up every thing<lb/>
very early in the morning- Now, lovie, I have written<lb/>
10 <hi>big</hi> pages, which equal <hi>20</hi> small ones, &amp; contain every-<lb/>
thing I can think about- Mrs. Harrison says she will write<lb/>
you by the next mail- She &amp; Mrs. H. send very much love-<lb/>
The latter says she wishes she could be up the Country with you<lb/>
to learn to paint wooden plates. Best love to Ma, two sister An-<lb/>
nie, Nita &amp; all- Kisses &amp; love and a hundred &ldquo;<hi>Boodigs</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
for both of my little darlings- Love &amp; think of old mantee<lb/>
a heap- Ever, my precious wife,</p>
