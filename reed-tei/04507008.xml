Dr. Philip S. Hench.<lb/>
Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Rochester. Minn.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>A few days ago, I spoke to Dr. Nogueira and, after a long con-<lb/>
versation he made me feel sure that the monument was to be named<lb/>
&ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo; and the caseta will keep its name of Building No. 1.<lb/>
Then after that, I went to see Architect Garc&iacute;a Meit&iacute;n, who is an<lb/>
old school-mate of mine, and he showed me the plan of the monument<lb/>
where it was wrtten &ldquo;Monument of Camp Lazear&rdquo; and he also made me<lb/>
feel sure that it was going to be that way. Further more, I went<lb/>
to see Engeneer Dominguez, also an old friend, and he told me the<lb/>
same thing.</p>
<p>I have been talking to friends of mine that are working at the<lb/>
Health Department and they all have told me just the same. By<lb/>
all that I could find out, I feel that it is completly the truth,<lb/>
that the monument wil be named Camp Lazear and the caseta, Building<lb/>
No. 1.</p>
<p>I am enclosing a <xref id="f04507009">drawing</xref> that I made of the plan that Garc&iacute;a Meit&iacute;n<lb/>
showed to me.</p>
<p>When I talked to Dr. Nogueira, I told him that I was sorry to see<lb/>
that the monument was not to be named &ldquo;Cuban-American etc... as it<lb/>
was your original idea, and I also made him know that I believed<lb/>
that you were the author of the idea and, at the same time, that<lb/>
you had discovered the caseta, and that you deserved to have a<lb/>
prominent part in every thing concerning the monument. On account<lb/>
of what he said, it looks to me, that he is a sincere friend of<lb/>
yours. Then I suggested to him that something should be done in<lb/>
the monument to make everybody know the principal part that you<lb/>
had had in it and I gave him the idea of writing your name in<lb/>
bronze with a saying that it all was due to your idea and your<lb/>
finding the caseta and, at the same time, who were you. He answered<lb/>
that he had in mind something like that and that after a short<lb/>
time he was going to do it.</p>
<p>As I think that you can be anxious to have news of this question<lb/>
I am sending you this letter right away, though I promise to <unclear>write</unclear>-<lb/>
giving you more details and being more careful with my english.<lb/>
I feel afraid that you can not understand some parts of my letter.<lb/>
My wife joins me in sending our best regards to Mrs. Hench and you<lb/>
and to the part of your family that we don't know, your children.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours</salute>
