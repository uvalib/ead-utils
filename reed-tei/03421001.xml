Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
MAYO CLINIC,<lb/>
Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your very kind letter dated July 6th reached me a few days<lb/>
ago, delay in receiving same being due to deficiency in address. Since<lb/>
my brief talk on the radio on January 18th, I have received over 250 fan<lb/>
letters. Most of them were addressed to me here in Havana but many came<lb/>
thru Lowell Thomas and the NBC Studios in Rockefeller Center, the few<lb/>
words I had to say being on Lowell Thomas' program and from the Studios<lb/>
of the NBC in Radio City. They appear to have my &ldquo;number&rdquo; at the Gen-<lb/>
eral Post Office here, by this time. Most of the letters were addressed<lb/>
to John J. Moran, Havana, Cuba. All letters showing my full name were<lb/>
promptly delivered to me, in as much as I happen to be the only &ldquo;John J.<lb/>
Moran&rdquo; listed in the telephone directory. It is pertinent to note here<lb/>
that there are a number of Morans listed in the 'phone directory, all<lb/>
Spaniards or of Spanish origin, except myself, the surname Moran being<lb/>
as typically Spanish as it is Irish. So much by way of introduction.</p>
<p>Within a few days I will send you a fairly complete and entirely<lb/>
accurate account of the yellow fever experiments carried out here by the<lb/>
&ldquo;Reed &amp; Carroll&rdquo; Board. Having acted as clerk-secretary to Major Reed<lb/>
while awaiting my turn at Camp Lazear, and with a very clear memory of<lb/>
the events leading up to and taking place during that &ldquo;now famous episode&rdquo;,<lb/>
as somebody has put it, I believe I am qualified to relate facts. I shall<lb/>
be pleased to pass same on to you in my own fashion and style. You can<lb/>
cull what you wish from my disjointed account of the experiments and word<lb/>
them in your own style, in a much more lucid manner than mine, I have no<lb/>
doubt. I will ask you to be patient with me for a few days while I pre-<lb/>
pare the &ldquo;story&rdquo; for you.</p>
<p>I have been living in Havana since March 1, 1928, and expect to<lb/>
live my few remaining years here. I visit the home office of Sun Oil<lb/>
Company once every two or three years and shall probably not make another<lb/>
trip to the U. S. before 1939. This company is a subsidiary of Sun Oil<lb/>
Company and I am its manager and treasurer. Perhaps you may happen to be<lb/>
in Havana next year or the year after. If so, I shall feel honored in<lb/>
meeting you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
