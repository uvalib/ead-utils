<salute>My dear Dr Ramos</salute>

</opener>
<p>The letter of Dr Albertini to Gen. A. E. Truby<lb/>
which came in my care was forwarded to<lb/>
him unopened as I did not know that it<lb/>
contained a letter from you to me. He has<lb/>
just sent your letter and Dr. Albertini's to me-<lb/>
Gen Truby who has had the misfortune of a cerebral<lb/>
hemorrhage, has requested me to give my opinion<lb/>
of what should be done about Dr. Albertinis letter<lb/>
He has, as I have also, an earnest desire to meet<lb/>
Dr A's wishes- But it is rather difficult to<lb/>
find out at what particular date that distin-<lb/>
guished Board of Expert Diagnosticians became<lb/>
convinced of the truth of the Finlay Theory of<lb/>
transmission of Yellow Fever- Was it before Oct. 10<lb/>
the date of Reeds letter, or after they had seen<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06403089"/>
2<lb/>
the case of Kissinger and the subsequent<lb/>
experimental cases? This is the question raised<lb/>
by Dr. Albertini and it is a difficult<lb/>
one to decide after forty four years-<lb/>
He can speak for himself and no one would<lb/>
think of questioning it- But can he speak<lb/>
for Gorgas and Juan Guiteras? We all<lb/>
know that Gorgas <hi>had not</hi> accepted it<lb/>
even four months lated when Reed reported<lb/>
his 11 conclusions to the Pan American Medical<lb/>
Congress in February 1901. He has with perfect<lb/>
frankness put this on record in his last<lb/>
report to Gen. Wood and he told me so<lb/>
just before the time of the Congress- With regard to<lb/>
Dr Guiteras, for whose memory I have a<lb/>
very affectionate regard. I do not know-<lb/>
we know that he promptly accepted the evidence<lb/>
of Reeds carefully controlled experiments and<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06403090"/>
3<lb/>
was convinced before the famous dinner<lb/>
which the doctors of Havana gave to Dr<lb/>
Finlay to celebrate the confirmation of his theory<lb/>
This was on Dec. 22 1900 and Dr Guiteras<lb/>
made the introductory speech which I remem-<lb/>
ber well as I had the honor of sitting next<lb/>
to that dear old man the guest of honor-<lb/>
I will see if I can find any thing which<lb/>
would shed light on the date of his conversion<lb/>
as it is the only date in question- In the<lb/>
interest of historical truth it should not<lb/>
be assumed that he had made up his mind<lb/>
before he saw the first experimental case.<lb/>
I do not think that it would add to his<lb/>
reputation to have done so- I had a visit<lb/>
from Dr Hench some after you did me the<lb/>
honor to call on Nov. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> and he told me<lb/>
of the happy chance by which he found you<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06403091"/>

in New York- His opinion will probably<lb/>
be desired by Gen Truby as to what may<lb/>
be the best thing to do to meet Dr Albertini's<lb/>
wishes-</p>
<closer>
<salute>With cordial regards</salute>

<seg>
Postscript- Gen Truby makes a note on the<lb/>
margin of Dr. A's letter that the expression<lb/>
to which he takes exception occurs in a letter<lb/>
to him and not to Reed's wife as stated by<lb/>
Dr A- The page reference also is not accurate.<lb/>
So the letter would have to be rewritten<lb/>
after all the evidence is in- It will not be<lb/>
easy to prove what individuals thought of<lb/>
the Finlay Theory before the demonstration by<lb/>
Reeds experiments was placed before them<lb/>
and when Reed permed this hasty note<lb/>
to Truby they had not seen the <hi>first case</hi><lb/>
Kissinger, which they saw later that day-<lb/>
We all know that Dr Finlay had made very<lb/>

Nov 22, 1944<lb/>
few converts in Havana before the Camp<lb/>
Lazear demonstration and I do not see<lb/>
why it should be considered a reflection<lb/>
on any member of the Yellow Fever Board<lb/>
to be skeptical on Oct. 10- After Reed's<lb/>
paper was read on Feb 4, 1901 it was differ-<lb/>
ent. It is very fortunate that you as<lb/>
the Director of the Institue Finlay are inter-<lb/>
ested in this question and I think that<lb/>
it might be well to have the decision as<lb/>
to what action should be taken, if any,<lb/>
left to you and Colonel Hench to determine<lb/>
you are more disinterested parties than<lb/>
Gen. Truby and I about any criticism<lb/>
of Major Walter Reed-<lb/>

Yours Sincerely<lb/>
