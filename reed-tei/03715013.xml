<p>Matters to discuss with Gen Kean &amp; with<lb/>
Curators Army Medical Museum &amp; Library</p>
<p>The remarks in ink<lb/>
are mine - A. E. T.</p>

<list type="ordered">
<item>1. Any photographs of places and personalities at<lb/>
Military Hospital #1<lb/>
Columbia Barracks--office<add>r</add>s quarters, etc,<lb/>
" "--<unclear>test</unclear> hospital<lb/>
Camp Lazear<lb/>
Los Animas Hospital as of 1900</item>
<item>2. <unclear>Lampson</unclear> (413.416) states that Finlay <del>wanted</del><add><unclear>visited</unclear></add> Reed June 26, 1900, the very day after Reed a<lb/>
arrived in Havana (June 25).</item>
<item>3. Epidemic broke out among United States' troops at Pinar del Rio in July 1900.<lb/>
thought by local authorities to be malaria. Agramonte says he went alone<lb/>
to Pinar del Rio July 19, recognized yellow fever and sent for Reed. Reed<lb/>
(Senate Doc. p. 61-165; J. Hygiene II: April 1902) says &ldquo;last week of July.&rdquo;<lb/>
Kelly (p. 124) says Reed and Agramonte went to Pinar del Rio together July 31.<lb/>
Which version correct? Did Agramonte go alone first and send for Reed (as<lb/>
seems likely), or is Kelly's version correct. It seems likely that Agramonte<lb/>
went alone July 19, sent for Reed who was with Agramonte in Pinar &ldquo;the last<lb/>
week in July.&rdquo;</item>
<item>4. &ldquo;First week in August &rdquo;--commission<del><unclear></unclear></del> called on Finlay for reprints and mosquito<lb/>
larvae. What was the exact date?</item>
<item>5. When was Reed <hi>recalled</hi> to Washington? <add>He and I <unclear>sailed</unclear> from Havana on Aug 2, on the SS <unclear>Rawlins</unclear></add> Senate document (page 90, 94) says August 2.<lb/>
Lampson (page 436) says August 4.</item>
<item>6. When did Reed leave Havana for Washington? <add>Aug 2. arrived N. Y. C. Aug 7.</add> Kelly said August 4; Lampson said<lb/>
August 5.</item>
<item>7. Who were the various Americans (besides Lazear, Carroll, Pinto and (Agramonte) <add>Agramonte was not bitten</add><lb/>
(?)<lb/>
who were first bitten by Lazear's mosquitoes (Table III--Senate Doc. p. 62)</item>
<item>8. Carroll was bitten August 27, 1900 and developed yellow fever August 31. Moran<lb/>
says Carroll's case was <hi>not</hi> regarded as one of experimental yellow fever.<lb/>
Record doctored? <add>The record was not doctored but probably did not<lb/>
give the source of the infection as it was still in doubt when the report went<lb/>
to Washington at the end of the month. I probably signed the report as Post Surgeon</add></item>
<item><p>9. Is Agramonte's story regarding the case of Dean correct? Agramonte gives the<lb/>
story that Dean walked by and granted Lazear's request that he (Dean) be bitten<lb/>
Kissinger says Lazear put mosquitos on Dean while Dean was asleep.</p>
<p><add>Agramonte's story is not true. He had absolutely nothing to do with Lazear's work.<lb/>
Kissingers, statement is also impossible-</add></p></item>
<item><p>10. When Carroll got yellow fever he was taken to the &ldquo;yellow fever ward&rdquo; (A<del>r</del>gramonte)<lb/>
to the &ldquo;yellow fever camp&rdquo; (Carroll--NY M J)</p>
<p><add>All cases were treated in the Camp Columbia yellow fever ward (<unclear>tents</unclear>) across the<lb/>
rail road tracks, due west of the Hospital. Lazear died there.</add></p></item>
<item>11. According to Lampson (455) Reed cabled (Sept 6) orders to suspend further inoculations<lb/>
until his return from Washington to Havana. Is this true? I find this comment<lb/>
nowhere else.</item>
<item>12. What is true version of Lazear's inoculation? The official version says he was bitten<lb/>
in Los Animas by a stray mosquito, September 13, but Agramonte (see his letter)<lb/>
infers in one place and states in another place (unpublished) that Lazear had himself<lb/>
bitten deliberately and when he actually got sick and realized that he had dis-<lb/>
obeyed Reed's orders, etc. he kept it a secret at first. Miss Agramonte says the<lb/>
Los Animas Hospital story was <unclear>concocted</unclear> for purposes connected with pension.</item>
<item>13. What was actual date of Reed's return to Cuba? Agramonte says it was &ldquo;early in<lb/>
October&rdquo; 1900. My records show Oct 1. but Kean says it was the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
this <unclear>can</unclear> I think be checked <unclear>up</unclear> in <unclear>the S.G.O.</unclear>.</item>
<item><p>14. Did Reed, Carroll and Agramonte all visit Wood (October 12?) to get his help for the<lb/>
commission's work? <add>Not true.</add></p>
<pb n="2" id="f03715014"/>
<p><add>Reed sailed from Havana Oct <unclear>24</unclear><lb/>
I think Carroll went later</add></p></item>
<item>15. Reed returned to Washington about third week in October to get the backing of the<lb/>
Surgeon General (says Ireland) and to give preliminary report. Carroll took short<lb/>
vacation to recuperate from his yellow fever. Did he accompany Reed north?<lb/>
(Lampson says so).</item>
<item>16. <add>Reed personally selected it. Agramonte had nothing to do with the selection and was not present-</add> Do you know exact site of Camp Lazear, circumstances of how it was chosen, etc.</item>
<item>17. Reed, etc. (Senate Doc. p. 71) says Dr. Roger Ames was among the personnel of Camp Lazear.<lb/>
Moran disputes this and says that Ames stayed at Columbia Barracks and was never (?)<lb/>
at Camp Lazear. Dr. Cooke was the only officer constantly at Camp Lazear but since<lb/>
he was being <unclear>experimented</unclear> upon himself he was really not in charge. There was<lb/>
no doctor &ldquo;in charge&rdquo; except Reed who went out to the camp at least twice a day.<lb/>
Is this correct? <add>Moran is mistaken.</add></item>
<item><p>18. Who were personnel of Camp Lazear. Senate Doc 61 (P. 19-71top-97) says Ames, Cooke and<lb/>
11 soldiers, but on page 71 (bottom) it gives a list which totals up to 16.</p>
<p><add>The personnel changed from time to time as cases developed and new volunteers entered Camp</add></p></item>
<item>19. Who were the &ldquo;two non-immunes&rdquo; who were in the non-infected side of the mosquito bldg.<lb/>
#2. (Noted on pages 10 and 86 of Senate Doc.) Did these same two non-immunes later<lb/>
go over into the infected side? Gorgas (Senate Doc p. 243 says, yes. Moran says, no.</item>
<item>20. Kelly (page 257) says commission wound up its work February 1901 and that Reed and<lb/>
Carroll returned to the United States together. Moran says that Carroll did not<lb/>
return with Reed, that Reed, Moran, and Kissinger left Havana in the same boat<lb/>
(Morro Castle) February 18 or 19, 1901.</item>
<item>21.Questions regarding location of Camp Lazear.<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(a) Was there any railroad track anywhere near the camp? <add>No-</add></item>
<item>(b) Where can I find an old map of camp Columbia's boundaries in relation to the<lb/>
Havana of 1900?</item>
<item>(c) What happened to the buildings used at Camp Lazear when camp disbanded?</item>
<item><p>(d) How many tents? (Reed said seven but composite pictures show more than that.)</p>
<p><add>The seven original ones were probably added to later to meet new conditions</add></p></item>
