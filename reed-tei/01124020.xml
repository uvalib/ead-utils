************<lb/>
Extract from a report by Dr. Seguin on the use of the Noguchi<lb/>
serum and vaccine during the Segou epidemic in French West<lb/>
Africa (Sudan) in 1922.<lb/>
Bamako, <date value="1923-02-12">Feb. 12, 1923.</date>
Report on the spidemic of yellow fever in Segou<lb/>
<hi>from October to November, 1922</hi>.</p>
<p>3) The first parcel of serum and vaccine reached Segou<lb/>
on November 9, where the last European to die had been Monsieur<lb/>
X... of the Niger Mission, on October 31. A first injection of<lb/>
2 cc. of vaccine was given to the inhabitants of Segou, about 40 in<lb/>
number, on November 10. The second injection was given on the<lb/>
14th, or four days later.</p>
<p>It also seemed necessary to vaccinate the nine members of<lb/>
the Niger Mission, of whom six were in Niamina and three in<lb/>
Sansanding. These vaccinations were made by Major Alexandre,<lb/>
at whose disposal the Governor of the Sudan placed a steamer,<lb/>
and they were completed on November 20.</p>
<p>A Liberian in the service of Dr. Y...., a member of the<lb/>
Niger Mission, was the last to die of yellow fever, on November<lb/>
9, the same day that the first parcel of vaccine was leaving<lb/>
Bamako. This death occurred in Segou.</p>
<p>It was therefore impossible to give this Liberian<lb/>
either serum or vaccine. Since there has been no further case<lb/>
of yellow fever in Segou, no trial of the Noguchi serum has been<lb/>
made. I can thus have no opinion as to the value of the serum.<lb/>
__________________________________________________<lb/>
(1) This serum and vaccine were part of the stock that<lb/>
Dr. Bauvallet had on hand.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01124021"/>
2.<lb/>
having had no patients on whom to try it.</p>
<p>As to the prophylactic value of the vaccine, the con-<lb/>
ditions under which it was used do not permit of any definite<lb/>
conclusions. The vaccine may have helped to destroy the small<lb/>
focus of yellow fever that existed in Segou, but it would not be<lb/>
scientific to affirm it. In fact, 11 days had already gone by<lb/>
since the last European death definitely due to yellow fever when<lb/>
the vaccine was first injected, and thirteen or fourteen days had<lb/>
passed since quarters inhabited by the preceding patients had been<lb/>
abandoned and disinfected, first by burning tobacco leaves and<lb/>
then by the use of sulphur.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the season was already advanced and<lb/>
the mosquitoes had become very rare. All these reasons make it<lb/>
impossible to draw any conclusions as to the value of the vaccine<lb/>
from the anti-yellow-fever vaccination practiced in Segou.</p>
