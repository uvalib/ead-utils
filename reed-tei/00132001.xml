<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your letter<lb/>
of the 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> and papers last night.<lb/>
You must not let people tire you.<lb/>
You do not seem to be able to shake<lb/>
people off when you do not want<lb/>
to be with them. You have too<lb/>
much of the milk of human kindness.<lb/>
But you really must learn that<lb/>
it is your duty to take care of<lb/>
yourself. There was no necessity<lb/>
whatever for you to go to town and<lb/>
run around with those wretched<lb/>
girls from Brownsville and I don't<lb/>
want to hear of your doing it<lb/>
again.</p>
<p>I have been going on with my work<lb/>
here as usual and nothing eventful<lb/>
has occurred. I have taken a<lb/>
few walks about town but have<lb/>
done no real sightseeing. After I<lb/>
get settled I shall take regular<lb/>
walks in town on week days and<lb/>
in the country on Sundays.</p>
<p>Our lodging is near the Meadows<lb/>
which is the &ldquo;common&rdquo; of the town.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00132002"/>
Hundreds of men and boys play cricket<lb/>
there every evening until after nine<lb/>
o'clock.</p>
<p>Your letter of the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May has just<lb/>
arrived with some papers. As to your<lb/>
trouble with Jane I can only repeat<lb/>
what I said before. You will have<lb/>
to let those people know that you<lb/>
are not at their beck and call.<lb/>
It is outrageous for them to send<lb/>
a harum scarum girl like that<lb/>
for you to take care of. You<lb/>
must just lay down the law<lb/>
to them and put a stop to the<lb/>
whole business. If she had had<lb/>
a little spanking at the proper<lb/>
time she would not need so<lb/>
much taking care of now.</p>
<p>I am always glad to get the papers<lb/>
you send. The Edinburgh papers<lb/>
have very little American news.<lb/>
I am sorry you did not go to<lb/>
hear the Strauss concerts but<lb/>
you will have a chance to hear<lb/>
them with me in New York next<lb/>
fall. The &ldquo;Gondoliers&rdquo; has been here<lb/>
during the present week played<lb/>
by almost the same company<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00132003"/>
as played it in New York last winter.<lb/>
They now call themselves the American<lb/>
Opera Company. Irving and Terry are<lb/>
to read Macbeth here on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi><lb/>
and I think I shall go and hear<lb/>
them. It is not often in a lifetime<lb/>
that one has a chance to hear<lb/>
such performers read Macbeth in<lb/>
the Heart of Mid-Llothian.</p>
<p>I will send you Edinburgh papers<lb/>
every now &amp; then.</p>
<p>I have concluded not to<lb/>
change my lodging. Waring does<lb/>
not interfere with me at all.<lb/>
We have now two washstands<lb/>
and everything. He always studies<lb/>
down in the sitting room so I<lb/>
have the bed-room to myself<lb/>
in the evenings. He sleeps later<lb/>
than I do in the morning and does<lb/>
not disturb me at all.</p>
<p>Give my love to all at Uncle Toms and<lb/>
at Mrs. Millers,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your affectionate son</salute>
