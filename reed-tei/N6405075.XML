<p>Deaths and Obituaries.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>JESSE W. LAZEAR, M.D., U.S.A., who died from yellow fever<lb/>
in Quemados, Cuba, September 26, was born in the suburbs of<lb/>
Baltimore, in 1866. He took a course of study and his B. A.<lb/>
degree at Johns Hopkins University, and his M. D. degree with<lb/>
honors at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York,<lb/>
1892. He served as interne for two years in Bellevue Hos-<lb/>
pital and then went to Germany for a year to pursue special<lb/>
studies in bacteriology. In 1895 he became demonstrator of<lb/>
clinical microscopy in Professor Osler's service, and one of the<lb/>
house physicians at Johns Hopkins hospital until the spring<lb/>
of 1900, when he entered the Medical Department of the Army<lb/>
as acting assistant-surgeon. He was at once assigned to duty<lb/>
at Quemados, Cuba, made a member of the board appointed<lb/>
for the study of yellow fever, and placed in charge of a labor-<lb/>
atory at that place. His work since then can be best de-<lb/>
scribed by quoting from the letter sent to the surgeon-general<lb/>
of the army, by the chief surgeon, department of western Cuba:<lb/>
&ldquo;Dr. Lazear has for the past four months exposed himself with<lb/>
absolute fearlessness in the discharge of his duties. He has<lb/>
examined the blood of every case of yellow fever which has oc-<lb/>
curred at Columbia barracks and in Marionao during that<lb/>
time; has immensely aided in the making of prompt diagnoses,<lb/>
which has been so important an element in our preventing the<lb/>
spread of the disease and in the success of the treatment of<lb/>
our cases. In the investigations of the board he has shown<lb/>
the same courage, earnestness and ability which characterized<lb/>
all his work. Dying at the age of 34, he leaves a wife and<lb/>
two children, the youngest of whom he never saw, as his son was<lb/>
born in the United States while he was in Cuba this summer.&rdquo;</p>
