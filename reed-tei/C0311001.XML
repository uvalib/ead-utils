<salute>My dear Miss Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The enclosed <xref id="C0311007">letter</xref><lb/>
from Col. Russell came to my office<lb/>
a week or more ago, but - as I've been<lb/>
<unclear>away</unclear> most of the time since then I've<lb/>
had no chance, until now, to follow it up.</p>
<p>Of course I shall be very happy to do<lb/>
anything that. I may to help <unclear>make</unclear> the I. H. B.<lb/>
memorial to your father more fitting. The<lb/>
printed memorial (in the I. H. B. Bulletin of Oct, 1925)<lb/>
seems to me, as it <unclear>surely must</unclear> seem<lb/>
to you, to be <unclear>utterly lacking</unclear> in any real<lb/>
appreciation of your father's <unclear>greatness</unclear> ex-<lb/>
cept in the tributes quoted from Hanson,<lb/>
Connor &amp; Thayer; and I want to do all of<lb/>
<unclear>can</unclear> to <unclear><del>make</del></unclear><add><unclear>help</unclear></add> make the contemplated &ldquo;minute&rdquo;<lb/>
more appropriate; and to this and I want,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0311002"/>
2<lb/>
first of all any suggestions or material that<lb/>
you may think appropriate. As I under-<lb/>
stand it the minute will be written by<lb/>
the Committee-presumably by Dr. Welch, &amp;<lb/>
what is necessary is <unclear>merely</unclear> to furnish them<lb/>
the material for it., I think, however, that<lb/>
this should be not <unclear>merely</unclear> bare facts, but-<lb/>
should include &ldquo;in large letters&rdquo; an appre-<lb/>
ciation of the <unclear>enormous</unclear> importance of<lb/>
your father's work &amp; of his greatness of<lb/>
<unclear>intellect</unclear> &amp; soul.</p>
<p>A few days ago, while in Washington, I<lb/>
took occasion to get out of the Bureau files<lb/>
&amp; to read your father's &ldquo;autobiography&rdquo;, which<lb/>
not only gave a pretty complete record of<lb/>
his Service duties but also gave me some<lb/>
view of his own ideas as to the relative<lb/>
importance of his various <unclear>work</unclear>. However,<lb/>
this record was evidently written about 1912<lb/>
or earlier, &amp; gives <unclear>an</unclear> account of his work<lb/>
in recent years in the study &amp; control of<lb/>
malaria in recent years--which, a you<lb/>
will note, is very lightly touched in the<lb/>
I. H. B. memorial.</p>
<pb n="3" id="fC0311003"/>
3<lb/>
Without having formed any definite plan,<lb/>
what I have in mind at present is;<lb/>
I To emphasize much more the account of<lb/>
his accomplishments in <add>solving</add> the epidemiology &amp;<lb/>
control, first, of yellow fever and then of malaria.<lb/>
To do this, I think the account given should:<lb/>
(1) Explain more fully &amp; clearly the first reaction,<lb/>
importance of the efforts which he began at<lb/>
Ship Island in '88.  Not only did <add>it</add> lead to the<lb/>
formulation of thoroughly rational &amp; at the<lb/>
same time far less onerous quarantine practice<lb/>
(which have made it possible ever since to<lb/>
maintain free communication between endem-<lb/>
ic areas &amp; our own infectible territory);  it<lb/>
also very clearly led him into his real <hi rend="underline">study</hi><lb/>
of yellow-fever, especially its incubation-per-<lb/>
iod, which was the key to quarantine practice;<lb/>
(2) To give a more graphic account of his dis-<lb/>
covery of the extrinsic incubation period:  calling<lb/>
attention to the remarkable observation &amp; clear<lb/>
reasoning which it represented &amp; to its fun-<lb/>
damental significance, which has been generally<lb/>
overlooked only because the experimental<lb/>
proof followed so close upon it's heels.<lb/>
(3) To at least record the fact of his close<lb/>
personal relations in Havana with Gorgas<lb/>
&amp; also (I believe) with Reed.  To those who<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="fC0311004"/>
<p>4</p>
<p>know Dr. Carter's reasoning powers <unclear>this </unclear><unclear>generosity</unclear><lb/>
in <unclear>counsel</unclear> the inference is obvious.</p>
<p>(4) To state clearly that in Panama he was not<lb/>
only Director of Hospitals, but also intimately<lb/>
associated both personaly &amp; officially with the<lb/>
sanitary control, bring officialy second in com-<lb/>
mand of the work &amp; <unclear>personally</unclear> Gorgas' chief adviser<lb/>
&amp; friend.</p>
<p>(5) To give a fuller &amp; better account of his work<lb/>
after leaving Panama, i.e his work on malaria<lb/>
in this country &amp; his work on yellow fever else-<lb/>
where. For this I lack the necessary data, which<lb/>
I hope you can supply.</p>
<p>(6) To give a more informative &amp; appreciative ac-<lb/>
count of his last work, in the history of yellow<lb/>
fever, for which also I lack the facts.</p>
<p>II. To make it clear that his achievement is<lb/>
not to be measured by any objective account<lb/>
of his own work, because he was altogether<lb/>
<unclear>unmindful</unclear> of personal credit  <unclear>[unclear]</unclear> himself<lb/>
<unclear>larger</unclear> in working for or through others.</p>
<p>III. To picture a little more (- no one could<lb/>
do it adequately) his personal qualities of<lb/>
greatness - his insatiable scientific curiosity,<lb/>
his store of knowledge &amp; precise analysis, his abso-<lb/>
lutely impartial &amp; impersonal honesty of <unclear>intellect</unclear>,<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="fC0311005"/>
his generosity, his absolute devotion to duty,<lb/>
his modesty, his enthusiasm, his courage &amp;<lb/>
all the qualities which made him the rare<lb/>
&amp; great man that he was.</p>
<p>All this however, is merely by way of showing<lb/>
you what is at present in my mind, and<lb/>
that for no purpose but to get your<lb/>
own ideas, for certainly you know him<lb/>
better than anybody else &amp; what would best<lb/>
serve the purpose would be to give them a<lb/>
much as possible <unclear>of what</unclear> you know of your<lb/>
father &amp; his work, &amp; that is, in fact, what<lb/>
I want to do.</p>
<p>I hope, from your letter to Susan, that we<lb/>
will be seeing you soon, but in the mean<lb/>
time I should like very much to hear from<lb/>
you about this. Your ideas &amp; any facts<lb/>
which you think <unclear>pertinent</unclear>.</p>
<p>I am ashamed of myself for not having<lb/>
written you <unclear>long</unclear> ago the letter that I prom-<lb/>
ised but - somehow I just haven't been able<lb/>
to do it. I think, before I can do it that I<lb/>
need to talk to you again to get any mind<lb/>
stirred out of its <unclear>habitual</unclear> torpor. Certainly I<lb/>
have never forgotten my promise, but have<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="fC0311006"/>
only felt that until something stirred me to<lb/>
it I could not possibly express what<lb/>
I want to say.</p>
<p>Susan sends love to you and I most<lb/>
cordial regards, to which little Susan would<lb/>
surely add some message if she were here;<lb/>
&amp; we all look forward with most pleas-<lb/>
ant anticipations to your long-deferred visit.<lb/>
I hope your summer's rest -- if it has<lb/>
been rest -- has done you much good<lb/>
&amp; that you'll come back prepared to<lb/>
enjoy work which I am sure is the<lb/>
normal condition for your father's daughter.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>

P.S. Have you a full bibliography of<lb/>
your father's writings?  If so I should like<lb/>
to have it to copy tho' I don't think it is<lb/>
needed for the I.H.B.<lb/>

<salute>Dear Dr. Frost:</salute>
</opener>
<p>A committee of our directors, consisting of Dr. Welch,<lb/>
Dr. Flexner and Dr. Edsall, was appointed to draft a minute with<lb/>
reference to Dr. Henry Rose Carter to be presented at the next<lb/>
meeting of the Board. We here in the office are preparing a<lb/>
memorandum for the use of this committee on Dr. Carter's life.<lb/>
We have already prepared one for publication in the International<lb/>
Health Board Bulletin, and I am sending you a copy of this. You<lb/>
would help us greatly if you would look this over and make such<lb/>
additions and corrections as you think desirable.</p>
<p>I am making this request of you because it has always<lb/>
been my belief that you knew more about Dr. Carter than anyone<lb/>
else of my acquaintance. We desire to have an accurate and<lb/>
fitting minute for the records of our Board, and I am sure that<lb/>
the Directors, as well as the officers, will appreciate any help<lb/>
you can give us.</p>
<p>I trust that you have had a pleasant vacation and that<lb/>
your work this fall will go well.</p>
<p>I might add that the meeting of the Board comes the<lb/>
first week in November and that we would like to have all the<lb/>
manuscript ready for the docket by the first of October. If<lb/>
you could send us the data before that date, it would be greatly<lb/>
appreciated.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
