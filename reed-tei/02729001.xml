Dr. Jas. Carroll.<lb/>
Asst. Surgeon U.S. Army<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor,</salute>
</opener>
<p>You probably know<lb/>
of me, as I of you, by the<lb/>
work in <add>which</add> each has had a<lb/>
hand. Like you, I started<lb/>
out in the Spanish War, (with<lb/>
purely philanthropic intent)<lb/>
as an Actg. Asst. Surgeon and<lb/>
<unclear>though</unclear> promoted for services<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02729002"/>
rendered to Major Brigade<lb/>
Surgeon. I do not forget that<lb/>
the chief of the medical<lb/>
work of that brief war &amp; espe-<lb/>
cially that which reflected<lb/>
chief honor upon the profes-<lb/>
sion of medicine, the country<lb/>
and the Army was performed<lb/>
by Actg. Asst. Surgeons. -- and<lb/>
I don't propose to permit others<lb/>
to forget it either.</p>
<p>I am just in receipt of a<lb/>
communication from Gen De-<lb/>
Witte. <unclear>Being</unclear> of the Walter<lb/>
Reed Memorial Assn. which<lb/>
is the cause of this letter to<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02729003"/>
you. I honor Major Reed and<lb/>
value his work as highly as<lb/>
any man on earth and will<lb/>
go as far as any in the effort<lb/>
to perpetuate his name and<lb/>
the recognition of what he did,<lb/>
always <hi>provided</hi> -- it is <hi>not<lb/>
at the expense of others and<lb/>
in derogation of what they did.</hi></p>
<p>I recognize that he was the<lb/>
master-mind and organizer<lb/>
in your work in Cuba and<lb/>
that he is, no doubt, entitled<lb/>
to the greatest credit and<lb/>
should and will have it,</p>
<p><hi>But</hi>, I do <hi>not</hi> agree that<lb/>
to give him his rightful <unclear>need</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02729004"/>
of recognition and honor, it is ne-<lb/>
cessary, just, or right to ignore,<lb/>
minimize or put out of sight the<lb/>
essential, heroic, devoted, and<lb/>
equally valuable work, in its de-<lb/>
gree, which you and Lazear and<lb/>
Agramonte did, -- and in and<lb/>
for which Lazear gave his<lb/>
life and you offered yours,</p>
<p>I will not consent to pass<lb/>
unchallenged this exclusive<lb/>
effort to do honor to Reed<lb/>
who was <hi>not</hi> the <hi>originator</hi> of<lb/>
the mosquito theory -- though he<lb/>
and you and the others were its<lb/>
<hi>demonstrators</hi>-, and have yourself<lb/>
Lazear and Agramonte treated<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02729005"/>
as of no account in the matter.<lb/>
Let us have these honors fairly<lb/>
rendered and fairly divided</p>
<p>The Medical Staff of the Reg-<lb/>
ular <hi>Army</hi>, or, to put it more<lb/>
correctly, the War Dept and the<lb/>
Surgeon Generals Office, have<lb/>
<hi>always</hi> endeavored to &ldquo;hog&rdquo;, and<lb/>
to arrogate to themselves, all<lb/>
credit for any achievements won<lb/>
by anyone in connection with<lb/>
the Service, though most of them<lb/>
have been won by volunteers or<lb/>
Actg. Asst Surgeons.</p>
<p>The jealousy of Sternberg,<lb/>
Hoff. Borden and others lest<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02729006"/>
some credit for something cred-<lb/>
itable shall go to someone<lb/>
not a &ldquo;<unclear>Coburger</unclear>&rdquo; or of the<lb/>
&ldquo;sacred circle&rdquo;, has caused<lb/>
a deal of injustice and<lb/>
meanness which is sure to<lb/>
come out, and I mean it shall<lb/>
Borden did good work. but is ambitious</p>
<p>I have, as I have said,<lb/>
-- but <hi>need</hi> not say, -- no wish<lb/>
to distract in the last, from<lb/>
the high honor and recogni-<lb/>
tion which should be given<lb/>
Reed, -- on the contrary I would<lb/>
make it more, rather than<lb/>
less, than others, and am not<lb/>
afraid of giving him too much<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02729007"/>
for what he really <hi>did</hi>, but<lb/>
I <hi>will not do it</hi> at the ex-<lb/>
pense of the dead Lazear,<lb/>
or at that of yourself or Ag-<lb/>
ramonte. -- <hi>for that is to<lb/>
dishonor him</hi>. There is no<lb/>
honor so empty as that which<lb/>
is filched from another and<lb/>
when it is filched from the<lb/>
dead it becomes <hi><unclear>damning</unclear><lb/>
dishonor</hi>!</p>
<p>I am sure Reed, if living,<lb/>
would not <hi>permit</hi> such in-<lb/>
justice, Dead, no <hi>true</hi> friend<lb/>
of his will <hi>suffer</hi>-, much<lb/>
less -- <hi>seek</hi>, its perpetration</p>
<pb n="8" id="f02729008"/>
<p>I propose to stand up and<lb/>
fight. -- if I stand alone -- for<lb/>
just recognition in your great<lb/>
work, to <hi>all</hi> engaged therein<lb/>
and I mean to stand, for the<lb/>
rest of my life, as the advocate<lb/>
of highest honors, not to deeds<lb/>
of destructive value <add>human brave</add> but to<lb/>
deeds of equal courage and<lb/>
devotion to the saving of life,<lb/>
to the blessing instead of the<lb/>
destruction of mankind. I wish<lb/>
you would send me. (in strict<lb/>
confidence if you like) <hi>all</hi> the<lb/>
facts and whatever has been printed<lb/>
as to the work of your commission<lb/>
at Quemados, I wish to be <hi>fully</hi><lb/>
informed. I will take no step with-<lb/>
out consulting you but I mean to be <unclear>armed</unclear> to demand<lb/>
that honors shall/go where they belong.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours,</salute>
