Dr. Tom D. Spies<lb/>
Nutrition Clinic<lb/>
Hillman Hospital<lb/>
Birmingham, Alabama<lb/>
<salute>My dear Tom:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you so much for your kind letter of February 7. The crossing the<lb/>
night we left was indeed pretty rough. Mary and I took Dramamine at<lb/>
the pier and when we saw just outside the harbor how rough it was, we<lb/>
took another one, went to our cabin and went to bed. Dramamine always<lb/>
makes us both quite sleepy so we promptly went to sleep, woke up about<lb/>
11, ordered some supper in our cabin and spent a very comfortable night,<lb/>
thanks to Dramamine.</p>
<p>On the train coming home however I caught a bad cold and felt rather<lb/>
miserable the first few days after we got home. Despite this you will<lb/>
be happy to know that I have finished the paper, made all necessary re-<lb/>
visions, added a fairly comprehensive bibliography and now it is in the<lb/>
hands of our Editorial Department who have already edited it. In a<lb/>
very few days it will be sent directly to Europe as you request and a<lb/>
copy will be sent to you.</p>
<p>Tom, let me express again to you my very deep appreciation for the very<lb/>
kind and generous hospitality which you, your Cuban friends and your own<lb/>
delightful secretarial party extended to Mary and me. You gave us one<lb/>
of the memorable trips of our lives. I never saw a man try more to<lb/>
make his guests comfortable and welcome. As I said to you, next to<lb/>
the Stockholm hospitality your hospitality to us in Havana takes the<lb/>
prize.</p>
<p>Let me say again how much I appreciated what you and Mrs. Smith did in<lb/>
regard to the Finlay Medal. This is my only decoration and of course<lb/>
gives me a particular pleasure. I consider it a real honor, especially<lb/>
as you also wear the Finlay Medal.</p>
<p>Please tell Betty, Jean, and Eleanor that I have sent the pictures off<lb/>
to be developed. As soon as they come I will send copies along. I leave<lb/>
tomorrow for five days in Washington but will be back the first of the week.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M.D.</signed>

P.S.: Out of curiosity and sentimality, I should like to have a copy of the<lb/>
English translation of Dr. Andreu's remarks made at the time of the decora-<lb/>
tion ceremony. I was told that Mario LeRoy was the man who translated Dr.<lb/>
Andreu's speech but I could not find his name in the telephone book. I am<lb/>
writing to Dr. Nogueira asking if he will get a copy of Dr. Andreu's speech<lb/>
for me through Mr. or Dr. LeRoy. If you happen to see him the next time you<lb/>
are in Havana, I would appreciate it if you would ask him whether he has been<lb/>
asked to send one along.<lb/>
