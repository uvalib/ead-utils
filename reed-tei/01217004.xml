<salute>Dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Many thanks for your note of November 24. Unfortu-<lb/>
nately it did not reach me until my return from New Orleans,<lb/>
so I did not have an opportunity to extend your greetings to<lb/>
those who attended the Malaria Conference. It will be no<lb/>
news to you, I am sure, that every mention of your name at<lb/>
the Conference evoked approval and applause which finally found<lb/>
concrete expression in your election for life as Honorary<lb/>
President of the National Malaria Committee.</p>
<p>The Conference was a great success, and there was<lb/>
more sustained interest than I have ever seen at a medical<lb/>
meeting anywhere in the world. There were never less than<lb/>
seventy-five in attendance. Those who had something to say,<lb/>
said it without urging. Practically all of those who talked<lb/>
had experience with the subject they were discussing. It was<lb/>
a bad thing for anyone to take the floor who was not thorough-<lb/>
ly familiar with his subject, because his ignorance was sure<lb/>

Dr. H.R. Carter<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>
December 4, 1924<lb/>
to be exposed by subsequent speakers.</p>
<p>It seemed to be the consensus of opinion of those at-<lb/>
tending the Conference that quinine does not prevent malaria<lb/>
infections, and that under ideal conditions it is very much<lb/>
better to withhold quinine until definite symptoms have de-<lb/>
veloped and then apply treatment. Ideal conditions, of course,<lb/>
do not happen often, and it is more than likely that quinine<lb/>
given in a so-called prophylactic way would have to be continued,<lb/>
because if persisted in long enough quinine will cure the in-<lb/>
fection after it has once been contracted. There was also gen-<lb/>
eral agreement that malaria control work should not be under-<lb/>
taken without first having a careful survey, and that those<lb/>
experienced in malaria control should define the problem and<lb/>
decide upon the measures to be taken. Darling's method for<lb/>
spleen examination had much favorable comment. Maxcy and<lb/>
Smillie also frequently brought to the attention of the Con-<lb/>
ference the need of a malariologist with each State Board of<lb/>
Health in the South. The control of malaria in tide-water<lb/>
counties like those of North Carolina still seems to be a dis-<lb/>
couraging undertaking. However, some figures were available<lb/>
which seemed to show that a 30% improvement had been made in<lb/>
a few such counties in North Carolina. It was much emphasized<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01217006"/>
Dr. H.R. Carter<lb/>
- 3 -<lb/>
December 4, 1924<lb/>
that a thoroughly well-balanced ration and treatment for com-<lb/>
plications, such as hookworm disease, are essential if re-<lb/>
lapses are to be held to a minimum. For the Piedmont area, at<lb/>
least, it seems to have been fairly well established that A.<lb/>
quadrimaculatus is the mosquito almost solely concerned in the<lb/>
transmission of malaria. Barber's report on the small amount<lb/>
of malaria he found in Louisiana, particularly in the rice<lb/>
field area, came as a surprise to most of us. The discovery<lb/>
by Paul Russell of a definite method for differentiating the<lb/>
larvae of quadrimaculatus of A. punctipennis and A. crucians<lb/>
was a very distinct contribution. It was also another illus-<lb/>
tration of the capacity of doctors to do successful work in<lb/>
other fields of science.</p>
<p>With the hope that everything is going well with you,<lb/>
and with cordial good wishes, I am,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute>
