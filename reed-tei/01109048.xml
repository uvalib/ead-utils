<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You will be interested to know that in the Colima<lb/>
area soap is being used as a larvacide in mosquito-<lb/>
proofing lejia (agua de ceniza) containers and the re-<lb/>
sults have been 100%.</p>
<p>For the past week the same measure has been in<lb/>
Tampico and with excellent results so much so that the<lb/>
sanitary inspectors no longer carry oil with them as<lb/>
formerly when we depended upon kerosene to kill the lar-<lb/>
vae in lejia containers.</p>
<p>I am certainly glad that you suggessted the use<lb/>
of soap for the lejias. It seemingly will solve the<lb/>
problem which has been not only annoying but quite<lb/>
expensive to handle since the begining of the present<lb/>
campaign. Am suggessting to the Board that they publish<lb/>
in the quarterly bulletin a short note regarding the<lb/>
soap measure so that our men elsewhere may try out the<lb/>
same.</p>
<p>Here follows a typical experiment with soap in lejia.<lb/>
"several small larvae, on of which was near pupation<lb/>
and two pupae were placed in the usual tin used for<lb/>
stowing lejia. A small quantity of the popular brand<lb/>
of laundry soap was introduced by rubbing between<lb/>
the hands with repeated immersions into the lejia.<lb/>
I estimate the amount of soap used as equal to that<lb/>
used by the average person in washing their hands.<lb/>
The result to the lejia was that it assumed a gray<lb/>
color without suds being formed.</p>
<p>Within two minutes after the introduction of the<lb/>
soap the larvae became wildly agitated and at no<lb/>
time did they seek the sides of the container but moved<lb/>
rapidly to and fro in the center of the container,<lb/>
and never once t<del><unclear>he</unclear></del>y did they adopt the breathing<lb/>
position.</p>
<p>In a short timev the larvae sank to the bottom of the<lb/>
container at varying intervals until death ensued<lb/>
when some of them floated to the surface of the<lb/>
lejia.</p>
<p>The addition of the soap appears to hasten pupation<lb/>
and the pupae resists the mixtures for several hours<lb/>
but in no instance did they survive longer than 24<lb/>
hours. This<del>s</del> data applies only to aedes egypti larvae<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01109049"/>
-2-<lb/>
Culex larvae do appear to be disturbed in the leastv by the<lb/>
addition of the soap. I suppose this is because they are a hardier<lb/>
insect than the stegomyia and more quickly adapt themselves to new<lb/>
surroundings.</p>
<p>For the moment the housewives furnish the soap but am planning<lb/>
further experiments with liquid soap as well as with soap chips<lb/>
and will advise you later of the results. It is worth recording<lb/>
that the washerwomen are emiently satisfied with this measure as<lb/>
compared with the oil, copper plates or fruit skins.</p>
<p>With all good wishes, I am,</p>
<closer>
<salute>very sincerely yours,</salute>
