<salute>Dear Ma:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have to take another trip to Biloxi tomor-<lb/>
row - a thing I despise &amp; I suppose that the short time<lb/>
between this &amp; Quarantine will be crammed<lb/>
full of work - due partly to my unlucky illness.<lb/>
But it cannot be as full as last year, I have<lb/>
had no end of trouble with my barges &amp; don't know<lb/>
when I will get them back,- they are in Biloxi wai-<lb/>
ting for a tug which has burst<del>ted</del> her cylinder.<lb/>
Time after next I will take the children over so as to get<lb/>
ashore once before Quarantine. They were ashore Jan/89</p>
<p>An asst. would be of no special use to me now. This ad-<lb/>
ministrative work can only be done by myself<lb/>
or some one in charge of the station. It simply cannot<lb/>
be helped &amp; must be done. It is not that there is too<lb/>
much to do - only the work has accumulated.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00716002"/>
Laura seemed quite sick yesterday<lb/>
&amp; day before better today but much<lb/>
weakened by her attack. If it please God<lb/>
the children will not have it.<lb/>
I am having all my arrange-<lb/>
ments broken up by expecting a steamer<lb/>
for the station. So far as<lb/>
this one season is concer-<lb/>
ned I had far rather not have her than<lb/>
otherwise, I am used to doing without &amp; the fixing<lb/>
his up selecting over etc will be an enormous amount<lb/>
of trouble-especially as I will have to throw <del>ab</del><add>about</add> 1/2 of<lb/>
my old employee's overboard which I hate to do.<lb/>
I must confess myself just now as thoroughly dissatis-<lb/>
fied with my station: thoroughly dissatisfied, I suppose<lb/>
the mood will pass by about June 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> when I am<lb/>
fairly at work, If it please God to give us all<lb/>
good health &amp; keep me from mistakes I will be<lb/>
very glad. A year is not a great while to bear<lb/>
anything.</p>
<p>About yourself, be <hi>especially careful of exertion</hi> &amp; take all the<lb/>
whiskey you can. Of course exposure is not good, but exer-<lb/>
tion seems far worse, you need not mind about missing<lb/>
your exercise. Take small dose say 2 grams of Quinine &amp; toddies<lb/>
say twice or three times a day, lie down whenever you feel<lb/>
like it. The weather here has been bad all through March.</p>
