<salute>Dear Doctor Deeks:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was hoping not to have a paper--that taking part in the de-<lb/>
bates would be sufficient. I usually have been very free in this<lb/>
latter. The reason for the first is that I have been putting all<lb/>
of the time I have been able to work since January 1st. in writing<lb/>
papers: or memoranda of one sort or another.</p>
<p>However, if you think that I ought to write a paper, I could<lb/>
present one on any of the following subjects:</p>
<p>1/ The work the I. H. B. is doing for the elimination of yel-<lb/>
low fever from the world.</p>
<p>I am still on the Yellow Fever Council and in close consulta-<lb/>
tion with them and probably know more about it than anyone save<lb/>
Russell. If this is already covered by some of their own men, I<lb/>
could make an expos&eacute; on</p>
<p>2/ The Place of Origin of Yellow Fever, and the possible<lb/>
effect in its determination on <del>its</del><add>the</add> prophylaxis of Yellow Fever.</p>
<p>3/ The witness which the early history of yellow fever bears<lb/>
to the spontaneous elimination (by "Failure of the Human Host??)<lb/>
of the disease in the American tropics.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01201008"/>
<p>tropics.</p>
<p>(Carter) Mem. (2)</p>
<p>4/ I wonder would a very short paper on the evidence against<lb/>
the pre-Columbian <del>prevalence</del><add>existence</add> of malaria in America be of more inter-<lb/>
rst than the yellow fever matters? I I think it would, but the objec-<lb/>
tion to my writing it is that I wrote a Memorandum (really for the<lb/>
personal edification of a friend of mine &amp; to show Schwellengreble)<lb/>
on this matter last year, which has been published as an editorial<lb/>
in the Southern Medical Journal and while I don't suppose this has<lb/>
any international circulation, yet it was published. Malaria should<lb/>
be of more present interest than yellow fever to your Conference,<lb/>
which latter disease will soon, I hope, be in the past.</p>
<p>5/ I could speak a piece from notes--I would scarcely have<lb/>
data enough to write it--on the &ldquo;Preferential and Compulsary<lb/>
Breeding Places of Some Disease-bearing Mosquitoes <add>(Anopheles on Stegomyia aegypti.</add> and the Limits<lb/>
that Determine the Latter.&rdquo; It would be short, but new and, I think,<lb/>
suggestive. It would take three to six months work to do justice<lb/>
to the subject and yet it might be worth while to start people<lb/>
thinking in that direction.</p>
<p>If you think I ought to write a paper, please choose which<lb/>
one, and give me notice, so that if it be of one of the first<lb/>
three, I would have time to take it up with the Rockefeller people.<lb/>
Indeed, I would have to have time for preparation for any of the<lb/>
others also.</p>
<p>With very best remembrances to you all, in which Laura joins</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly your friend,</salute>
</closer>
