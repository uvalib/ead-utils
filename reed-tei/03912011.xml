GEORGE A. KELLOGG<lb/>
257 CORNELISON AVENUE<lb/>
JERSEY CITY, N. J.<lb/>
<date value="1942-04-22">April 22, 1942</date>
</dateline>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench,</salute>
</opener>
<p>A few minutes ago I received a letter from Dr. Rankin whom, you<lb/>
know, we had asked to speak at the unveiling of the McDowell paint-<lb/>
ing at Atlantic City on June 8th. Up until last Monday I had not<lb/>
heard from him and I called him on the 'phone and received what I<lb/>
thought was a fairly definite acceptance. In addition he wished<lb/>
some slight changes which I assured him Mr. Cornwell would be glad<lb/>
to make in the painting even though we have had some small 4-color<lb/>
process plates made.</p>
<p>Find attached a copy of Dr. Rankin's letter which came in this morn-<lb/>
ing as well as a copy of my reply to him. If, in your judgment, it<lb/>
would be a good thing to do, would you write Dr. Rankin and say that<lb/>
just incidentally you had heard from me to the effect that he would<lb/>
speak at the unveiling of the McDowell painting. In your letter<lb/>
you might assure him that you think the project is worthwhile, if<lb/>
you feel that it is, and that you feel that he will have a large<lb/>
and rather important audience.</p>
<p>You will note that in his letter he is afraid that he might be with<lb/>
the House of Delegates. Mr. Withington and I were in Atlantic City<lb/>
yesterday and arranged for the use of the Rose Room in the Traymore<lb/>
Hotel in which the House of Delegates will meet. As a matter of<lb/>
fact, in my opinion a good percentage of the House of Delegates will<lb/>
be present at our luncheon.</p>
<p>I suppose that Dr. Rankin does not realize how seriously we take this<lb/>
affair and I don't want to be the one to scare him out. I would<lb/>
rather say nothing about that side of it. At the same time, after<lb/>
having sent out five hundred engraved invitations on which he is men-<lb/>
tioned as giving the dedicatory address (or whatever it is we shall<lb/>
call it) we would be in a devil of a fix if he didn't show up. Act-<lb/>
ually, we are counting on a luncheon for 170 persons. Unlike last<lb/>
year, we are starting early enough so that we can be sure of the full<lb/>
number of acceptances.</p>
<p>As you may recall, the unveiling arrangements for &ldquo;The Conquerors&rdquo;<lb/>
at the A.M.A. Convention were made only a few days before the Conven-<lb/>
tion, and our preparations were inadequate.</p>
<p>Incidentally, as a member of the Pioneers of American Medicine Speak-<lb/>
ers Club, you and Mrs. Hench will be invited to sit at the speaker's<lb/>
table.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03912012"/>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>I will certainly appreciate anything you can do<lb/>
in this situation to help insure the presence of Dr. Rankin.</p>
