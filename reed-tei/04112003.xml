Dr. Foster Kennedy<lb/>
14 Sutter Square<lb/>
New York, New York<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Kennedy:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Many weeks ago you and I had a brief correspondence about a<lb/>
yellow fever item that had come into your possession. I had hoped<lb/>
to be able to visit you briefly when I was in New York in June, but<lb/>
I was so busy attending medical meetings that I wasn't able to.<lb/>
Last month I went to the American Medical Association meeting,<lb/>
stayed at the Mark Hopkins for a week and then went to El Encanto<lb/>
at Santa Barbara for five days' rest with Mrs. Hench. The second<lb/>
or third day we were there, we ran into Dr. and Mrs. Fitz and were<lb/>
with them at a luncheon at one of the beach clubs. My wife noticed<lb/>
there two people whom she remembered having seen at the hotel in<lb/>
San Francisco and also at El Encanto. She noticed Dr. Fitz speaking<lb/>
to them and asked who they were.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly you are away ahead of me. That couple were you<lb/>
and Mrs. Kennedy. Unfortunately my wife did not tell me until<lb/>
later that afternoon. I was so disappointed not to know that you<lb/>
were there and not to have been <unclear>able</unclear> to meet you. I tried to phone<lb/>
you at the home of one of your friends in Santa Barbara, but was<lb/>
informed that you had just left, I believe for Los Angeles. I am<lb/>
especially sorry that we did not meet, as in Santa Barbara I saw<lb/>
Houston Lazear, the son of Dr. Lazear, a yellow fever fan. Houston<lb/>
knew very little about his father and I had the privilege of telling<lb/>
him things he had never heard. It is a shame that you, in your<lb/>
interest in the conquest of yellow fever, did not have the opportunity<lb/>
of meeting them.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the next time I am in New York, I will<lb/>
have the opportunity to call on you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>Philip S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
