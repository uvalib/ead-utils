<salute>Dear Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Dr. Rose tells me he will be away until the end of September<lb/>
and has left you to carry on at 61, so you are going to listen to the<lb/>
story of Panuco.</p>
<p>For administrative purposes I am accepting the diagnosis of<lb/>
Stubbs, confirmed by Perrin after examination of specimens of liver,<lb/>
kidney and spleen, but I asked Perrin to send Noguchi a section of each<lb/>
and wonder if he did.</p>
<p>I have put on a force to eliminate all Stegomyia in Panuco<lb/>
and also all Anopheles since these latter, breeding in a pond in center<lb/>
of town, are confusing diagnosis heavily.</p>
<p>My own private opinion remains unchanged and will so remain<lb/>
until Noguchi says those tissues (not those I sent) from Prebyl's body<lb/>
represent actual yellow fever.</p>
<p>Will you not see him and if you see fit show him this letter?</p>
<p>Prebyl and his chum, Richard Arthur, got sick about July 22<lb/>
in Panuco. The former died on the 28th in Tampico - the latter 25th I<lb/>
think in this city, and I am seeking his history. If both had yellow<lb/>
fever then they were ex-<unclear>mc</unclear>-secondary cases and represent previous infection.</p>
<p>Both practically lived in the restricted district and, along<lb/>
with dozens of other Americans of the so-called rough neck class, they<lb/>
mingled freely night and day with the loose women. There are about 100<lb/>
to 150 of each sex and all non-immune, and an incidence of 55% of house<lb/>
infection with Stegs.</p>
<p>I know that it must spread under such conditions and altho<lb/>
from 22nd to date 17th gives us 26 days and all we need minimally is<lb/>
3 plus 12 plus 4 equal 19 days to show up fresh cases, there has not a<lb/>
case shown up.</p>
<p>We have refrained from molesting the adult mosquito because<lb/>
we wanted to know, and because I had faith in Connor to believe him when<lb/>
he declared Tampico clean and I reviewed it and found an index down to 5%<lb/>
and it has been three months.</p>
<p>Now, where did it come from if it is yellow fever?</p>
<p>I should like these facts submitted to Carter for an opinion,<lb/>
because if it be true that yellow fever can lurk 18 months in the rural<lb/>
districts or even 6 months, we must revise our whole scheme. I don't<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00937026"/>
2<lb/>
believe it, and if Noguchi verifies Perrin's findings, I am then convinced<lb/>
that Cuba or some other point within incubation period by ship from Panuco<lb/>
is again lit up.</p>
<p>We are finding A.E. and Tertian in practically all blood<lb/>
examined and the symptoms are well described (Connor says) in Chalmers<lb/>
and Castellani on Tropical Diseases, pp. 1164-1172.</p>
<p>For my own part, after spending some days in Panuco, and<lb/>
seeing cases and making an autopsy on a soldier who in life did look<lb/>
suspicious and who died with uramic convulsions, I am satisfied that<lb/>
I saw only malaria. I sent liver, spleen and kidney tissues on the<lb/>
Mexico to Noguchi from that case, which was one of the sort most<lb/>
frequently called yellow fever in this country.</p>
<p>As soon as this scare is over I am going to New York,<lb/>
probably about October 1, and while there I want to talk to you and<lb/>
Noguchi about the (in my opinion) necessity for a better study of<lb/>
tropical malaria which is as different from home as it may well be,-<lb/>
also other matters, so if you contemplate a hasty exit, write me and<lb/>
let me adjust my plans.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours</salute>
