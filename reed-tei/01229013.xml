<p>Deaths</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Henry Rose Carter <unclear>+</unclear> Assistant Surgeon General, U. S.<lb/>
Public Health Service, died at his home in Washington, D. C.,<lb/>
<hi>September 14, aged 73</hi>. In 1900 he published a paper record-<lb/>
ing observations made in 1898 on the interval between infect-<lb/>
ing and secondary cases of yellow fever. <hi>Dr. Walter Reed,<lb/>
impressed by these observations, was led by them to the idea<lb/>
of an intermediate host, the mosquito</hi>, as the important factor<lb/>
in the spread of the disease, later established by the Yellow<lb/>
Fever Commission.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter graduated from the University of Virginia in<lb/>
civil engineering in 1873 and from the University of Maryland<lb/>
School of Medicine, Baltimore, in 1879. He then entered the<lb/>
United States Public Health Service, continuing constantly<lb/>
with that organization until his death. For many years he<lb/>
was closely associated with the control of yellow fever and<lb/>
malaria in the Southern states, publishing his first paper on<lb/>
&ldquo;Yellow Fever Mortality in Havana&rdquo; in 1900. He inaugurated<lb/>
a quarantine system in Cuba in 1899, and from 1904 to 1909<lb/>
was director of hospitals in the<lb/>
Panama Canal Zone. His work<lb/>
on yellow fever was so striking<lb/>
that Sir Ronald Ross recom-<lb/>
mended him for the Nobel prize<lb/>
in medicine in 1904, and further<lb/>
recognition was given to him<lb/>
when he was commissioned<lb/>
Assistant Surgeon General by<lb/>
a special act of Congress in 1915.<lb/>
His papers previous to 1915 were<lb/>
devoted largely to yellow fever.<lb/>
In 1914 he turned his attention to<lb/>
malaria, and published valuable<lb/>
observations over several years.<lb/>

Dr. Carter went to Central and<lb/>
South America as a member of<lb/>
the Rockefeller Foundation Yel-<lb/>
low Fever Commission in 1916;<lb/>
was in charge of malaria work<lb/>
for the Public Health Service,<lb/>
1917-1918; was sanitary adviser<lb/>
to the Peruvian government,<lb/>
1920-1921, and had been a mem-<lb/>
ber of the Yellow Fever Com-<lb/>
mission of the International<lb/>
Health Board since 1920. He<lb/>
was a clear analyst and a prac-<lb/>
tical thinker in the field of pre-<lb/>
ventive medicine; for almost half<lb/>
a century he lent valuable assis-<lb/>
tance to the governments of the<lb/>
world in the control of tropical<lb/>
diseases. In <hi>Hygeia for January<lb/>
and February, 1925, he</hi> recorded<lb/>
personal experiences in such work, giving a true picture of<lb/>
the romance of preventive medicine.</p>
