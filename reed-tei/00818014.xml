Dr. J. C. Geiger, Assistant Epidemiologist,<lb/>
U. S. Public Health Service,<lb/>
City Hall Building,<lb/>
Little Rock, Ark.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Geiger:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I congratulate you on your Doctorate of Public Health. I<lb/>
am sure you deserved it and very sure that your future work will<lb/>
make Tulane proud of her son.</p>
<p>I am still afraid you have taken too ambitious a program.<lb/>
It is a good plan to concentrate on something and complete it so<lb/>
that no one else will ever have to do any more work on it.</p>
<p>I judge that your problem is &ldquo;The Relation of Rice Culture<lb/>
to the Incidence of Malaria,&rdquo; and its object is to try to find<lb/>
methods economically practicable for its control, or at least for<lb/>
minimizing it. If that be the case, you should lay yourself out<lb/>
on the questions pertaining to it and stress nothing else. It<lb/>
will take at least three years more I judge. I don't mean that<lb/>
you will not keep your eyes open and pick up all the data bearing<lb/>
on other malarial problems incidentally, but it will be incident-<lb/>
ally--the other your object.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think it would be a good plan to have more<lb/>
than one of your sub-divided rice plats--say--100 to 200 yds. apart.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00818015"/>
-2-<lb/>
You will have to draw your deductions as to control of mosquito<lb/>
production from these plats and three or four are none too many:<lb/>
something may happen to one--as the hog got in at Lonoke. Having<lb/>
several there is no reason that they should be so large or have<lb/>
so many divisions, but I think it will pay you to scatter your plats.</p>
<p>As this is all the <hi>experimental</hi> field work you have planned--<lb/>
although you may be compelled to do some other incidentally--<lb/>
it will pay you to develope it. I contrast experimental field work<lb/>
with the field observations that you will make.</p>
<p>Observations on flight will be among the most important you<lb/>
will make--and keep the expressions: &ldquo;of sanitary importance: of<lb/>
no sanitary importance&rdquo; in your mind all the time. The number of<lb/>
imagoes produced or found at a place or in a residence is of prime<lb/>
importance--I mean whether a few or many. I don't mean to count<lb/>
them.</p>
<p>You might keep your eyes open for data on what is--I think--<lb/>
the most important field problem for the U. S. yet unsolved,<lb/>
namely: the proportional degree to which the differenct species of<lb/>
Anopheles are, in nature, vectors of malaria. It is not a ride<lb/>
culture problem. however, so only look into it if you have a chance<lb/>
incidentally. You remember how we had it planned in the program<lb/>
I sent you about Christmas; or do you?</p>
<p>However, the object of this letter is to advise you to con-<lb/>
centrate--i. e. &ldquo;not to bite off more than you can chew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seek advice--don't necessarily follow it. Get the opinions<lb/>
of others--don't necessarily adopt them.</p>
<p>I had a series of field problems written out in 1917 in the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00818016"/>
-3-<lb/>
spring, which are good to keep in mind. I will write to Miss Riva<lb/>
and ask her to send you a copy.</p>
<p>Learn all you possibly can as to the kind of breeding places<lb/>
of the different species. Amen.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
<signed>Assistant Surgeon General</signed>.
