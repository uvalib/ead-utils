General J. R. Kean<lb/>
2804 N Street N. W.<lb/>
Georgetown<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Kwan:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I cannot tell you how much I appreciated your great patience and kindness<lb/>
in letting me spend the long hours with you last week. Your information was most<lb/>
helpful indeed, and by far the most authentic that I received. There were many<lb/>
things that you mentioned, the significance of which I did not appreciate until after<lb/>
I had left you and was thinking them over. I am going to take the liberty of writing<lb/>
you again within a few days, after I have correlated my thoughts, and made some notes,<lb/>
and will ask you to amplify some of the remarks which you made to me.</p>
<p>The two most important points that you can help me on are (1) to give me<lb/>
a statement as to the information General Truby gave you regarding Lazear's experi-<lb/>
mental rather than accidental yellow fever, and (2) send me in your own handwriting,<lb/>
your statement as to your recollections regarding the railroad tracks behind Camp<lb/>
Columbia, the little bridge over it, and the location, on the other side of the<lb/>
railroad track, of the small tent hospital used to receive the victims of experimental<lb/>
yellow fever after their removal from Camp Lazear. No matter how strong my language,<lb/>
anything that I say you told me will not carry nearly the weight that it would if<lb/>
in your own handwriting or a document signed by you, that these above statements are<lb/>
correct. Rather than have you go to the bother of writing these out in long hand,<lb/>
I think it would be best for me to ask you to get the services of a public stenographer.<lb/>
I will write down a few questions which I should like to have answered, and then you<lb/>
can answer them in just as much detail as possible. She can come to your house, take<lb/>
these answers down, type them, make a copy for you, and an original and two or three<lb/>
extra copies for me. You can then merely sign these pages in your own handwriting<lb/>
and that will stand for all time as documentary proof. I will then have photostatic<lb/>
copies of your remarks made and file them in the three or four places where they should<lb/>
be filed: (1) the Army Medical Museum, (2) the Alderman Library at the University<lb/>
of Virginia, (3) probably in the Historical Library at Johns Hopkins, and (4) Welch<lb/>
Historical Library.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I cannot thank you enough for the many courtesies you showed<lb/>
me, and I regret bothering you with the book which I stupidly left at your house.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
