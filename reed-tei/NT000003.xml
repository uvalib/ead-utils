<p>HORRIBLE..... IF IT'S TRUE!</p>
<p>
Yellow fever transmitted to Spanish immigrants<lb/>
by mosquitos!</p>
<p>New details regarding the horrible<lb/>
experiment to prove the possibility that<lb/>
yellow fever is transmitted to a person<lb/>
through mosquito bites - to which we<lb/>
referred yesterday- have been<lb/>
communicated to us.</p>
<p>"The procedure that is employed," writes<lb/>
an anonymous collaborator, "is not to<lb/>
release the mentioned insects into the<lb/>
room where the immigrants sleep."</p>
<p>They have them in glass tubes,wherein<lb/>
one of the ends is uncapped, applying<lb/>
them to the body of someone attacked by<lb/>
the endemic illness.  As is natural, the<lb/>
moquito, forcibly, has to bite the patient;<lb/>
after which the mosquito is again<lb/>
captured, and after a day has passed, the<lb/>
same procedure is performed on a<lb/>
healthy person.  If the healthy person<lb/>
becomes sick shortly afterwards, the bite<lb/>
has transmitted the illness.  In the<lb/>
opposite case, the experiment serves to<lb/>
show that it is not one of the methods of<lb/>
infection.</p>
<p>"Also," continues our anonymous<lb/>
informant," other methods are<lb/>
being tested to see how a healthy<lb/>
man can become infected.  To that<lb/>
end, immigrants are given-destining<lb/>
them for their use-the bed clothes<lb/>
that have served the sick during<lb/>
the course of their illness.</p>
<p>"The most unheard of is" -the letter<lb/>
ends this way- "that in some of the<lb/>
cases the experiment subjects know<lb/>
perfectly well that they are the object of<lb/>
an experiment, though without realizing<lb/>
that this could cost them their lives; but<lb/>
they accept it in exchange for the offer<lb/>
of 100 pesos that is made to them."</p>
<p>Up to this point the reports that,without a<lb/>
true guarantee, we receive, we report.</p>
<p>Our opinion with respect to the act is<lb/>
already expressed: we hesitate to believe<lb/>
in its existence; it seems impossible to<lb/>
us... But it seems impossible at the same<lb/>
time that it is not proven false through a<lb/>
scrupulous investigation; and to practice<lb/>
this arouses the jealousy of the<lb/>
administrative authorities.</p>
