<title>Letter from George A. Kellogg to Federico Gomez, March 17, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Kellogg refers to Dominguez's book on Finlay's work, which he has not yet read. Kellogg discusses Finlay's mosquito vector theory and the later work of the Yellow Fever Commission. Kellogg is anxious that all involved receive due credit for the conquest of yellow fever and that too much emphasis on Finlay's contributions be avoided.</p>

<salute>Dear Fico:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Since writing to you yesterday I have been giving the subject of your letter a great deal<lb/>
of thought as the whole proposition seems to be full of dynamite. In the first place,<lb/>
I have not read Doctor Dominguez' book on Dr. Finlay's work. If Dr. Dominguez' book<lb/>
gives Finlay credit for proving anything definite about the transmission of Yellow Fever,<lb/>
I don't think it should be reprinted. I wouldn't be in favor of having it widely<lb/>
distributed. For the facts of the case are, as I understand them, that Dr. Finlay tried<lb/>
to prove his theory, which indidentally was a correct theory, but was never able to<lb/>
prove his belief in a manner that would hold water even to his own colleagues in Havana.<lb/>
Finlay should get a lot of credit for propounding his theory and staying with the idea<lb/>
as many years as he did. We are going to give him a good position in the painting which<lb/>
Cornwall is doing. However, it was only through the combined efforts of Wood, Reed,<lb/>
Lazear and many others that the theory was proved to be a fact.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that there are today in Cuba large groups who wish to give Finlay<lb/>
credit for having proved his theory in spite of the fact that the world would not accept<lb/>
his proof. I could not be a party to the backing up of this propaganda. On the other<lb/>
hand I don't wish to come out and say so to the Cubans at this time. Dr. Philip Hench<lb/>
of the Mayo Clinic who has been making a careful study of the Yellow Fever story for many<lb/>
<unclear>years</unclear> and who is practically on his way to Havana at this moment would be much embarrassed,<lb/>
I am sure, if I were to send him a letter which would be satisfactory to the Cubans,<lb/>
especially inasmuch as I am in the dark as to just what Dr. Dominguez' book says.</p>
<p>Dr. Hench has been very helpful to us in giving us a tremendous amount of information.<lb/>
We are revising our original sketch on his advice. He is going to Cuba to continue<lb/>
research and further his efforts to establish a proper site for the Lazear Memorial in<lb/>
or near Havana.</p>
<p>Would it not be possible for you to give your doctor friend (Milanes) an evasive<lb/>
answer? Tell him that we have not completed our research and do not feel that we are<lb/>
yet in a position to make any comments on the situation. Further, we have not read<lb/>
Dr. Dominguez' book and would not wish to <unclear>be</unclear> placed in the position of sponsoring a<lb/>
work, the contents of which are unknown to us. I am sure you can soften the blow.</p>
<p>Incidentally, for your information and please bear in mind that this whole letter is for<lb/>
your information only, I am afraid that between Cornwall and myself we gave the Cubans<lb/>
an impresion that we are going to play up Finlay as the biggest of all the big shots in<lb/>
the Yellow Fever investigation. We were misled at the time we were there into thinking<lb/>
that perhaps he was and of course we were anxious to please. We are going to paint a<lb/>
picture which gives a fair and just credit to at least the most of those involved or we<lb/>
are not going to paint any at all. What we have produced, I am inclined to believe,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03807014"/>
-2-<lb/>
will not be viewed with favor by this group of Cuban physicians of whom you are writing.<lb/>
We may not want to show our picture in Cuba.</p>
<p>In any event, please destroy this letter and get us out of having to write anything to the<lb/>
Cubans at this time in any way that you think will be most acceptable to them.</p>
<p>With kindest personal regards, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
ecs<lb/>
<seg>
P.S. I am sure that not all the prominent physicians in Cuba have this distorted opinion<lb/>
of Finlay's work. Dr. Kohly, I think, appreciates the perspective in which Finlay's work<lb/>
should be held but I should hesitate even to write him my opinions at this time.<lb/>
Doctor Hench has told me of several physicians whom he met who are opposed to the<lb/>
excessive glorification of Finlay. I don't recall their names at this moment but I can<lb/>
assure you, Fico, that we don't want to get caught in the middle of what may be an<lb/>
international argument. What we set out to do was to create a better feeling between<lb/>
Cuba and the United States among other things, but the situation is such that we may do<lb/>
just the opposite if we are not careful. I will have to depend on your discretion to<lb/>
keep us out of any real trouble.<lb/>
