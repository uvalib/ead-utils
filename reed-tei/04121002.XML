Pennsylvania<lb/>
<salute>My dear Friends:</salute>
</opener>
<p>By separate post I am sending you some small enlargements<lb/>
of snapshots I took at the recent Meeting of the Board of Managers<lb/>
of the Walter Reed Memorial Association in Washington. I thought<lb/>
you would like to have them. They were taken with a $5 &ldquo;flash&rdquo;<lb/>
Brownie so please don't compare them to professional photographs.</p>
<p>Mary and I were so pleased to receive your nice<lb/>
Christmas card. My former secretary, Miss Schnurr, arrives for<lb/>
a Christmas visit soon--I am anxious to see her notes of our<lb/>
evening's conversation. I had such a grand time with you all.</p>
<p>After the Christmas rush and when you have time I would<lb/>
appreciate it tremendously if you would look up the additional<lb/>
letters and items which you mentioned as having and said you<lb/>
would let me see. It would be most helpful indeed.</p>
<p>I enclose a picture of the apartment house which<lb/>
General Kean pointed out to me as being the one in which your<lb/>
family lived at the time of your father's death. As I recollect<lb/>
it, you stated that you lived on the first floor in the apartment<lb/>
on the left of the picture. Is that correct? I am very anxious<lb/>
to have you identify the spot. Also I enclose a picture of the<lb/>
house in Blue Ridge Summit which was pointed out to me as being<lb/>
that of your father. I had a little difficulty in getting someone<lb/>
to show it to me, but Mr. Harry Cox very kindly drove up with me.<lb/>
As I understand it, it is on Mount Anglewood and is now known as<lb/>
the Hahn Place. Is my information correct? I do hope this is<lb/>
the right house. I will be greatly disappointed if I have been<lb/>
misinformed.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
