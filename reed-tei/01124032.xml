HEALTH SERVICE<lb/>
The Chief of the Health Service<lb/>
<salute>To the Lieutenant-Governor at Porto-Novo.</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have the honor to report the results of the inquiry prescribed by<lb/>
the Colonial Minister on the origin of the yellow fever cases at Ouidah.</p>
<p>Every idea of importation by the European element can be completely<lb/>
rejected. The persons attacked had been at Ouidah a long time and had not<lb/>
traveled. They must therefore have been infected on the spot. Officer Lefur<lb/>
was the only one who had recently arrived in the Colony, but he came from<lb/>
the Ivory Coast which has not been contaminated, and had been at Ouidah since<lb/>
May 18th. He first showed signs of fatigue on the 5th or 6th of June and<lb/>
died on the 10th of June. For that matter he was only the third person attacked.</p>
<p>The view of the accidental infection by sea or air route of the<lb/>
European element cannot be maintained. As Dr. Valmorin remarks in his report,<lb/>
Ouidah's sea connections with other colonies are very limited and do not<lb/>
admit the view of a possible infection of European origin. By land the only<lb/>
regular communication is with Togo and Nigeria. It is hardly possible for<lb/>
a European coming from the Gold Coast or Nigeria to make so short a stay at<lb/>
Dahomey that he will pass unnoticed if he has yellow fever symptoms. The<lb/>
question must be examined from an entirely different angle, as far as the<lb/>
natives are concerned. But first of all we must mention a view accepted with-<lb/>
out discussion as a dogma, that African races are entirely immune to yellow<lb/>
fever. This has been generally admitted up to the present, perhaps due to<lb/>
insufficient observation and lack of information on what goes on among the<lb/>
natives. As a matter of fact in Dr. Valmorin's report we note a very interesting<lb/>

fact which should receive attention, although it did not receive any medical<lb/>
observation, the suspicious case of a child that died on the third day of its<lb/>
illness after having vomited blood. Furthermore, two cases of yellow fever<lb/>
among natives reported recently at Cape Coast by the English Gold Coast author-<lb/>
ities.</p>
<p>The opinion given by the Inspector General of the Health Service of<lb/>
West Africa, in his note of August 28th, 1922, to the effect that European cases<lb/>
are only the visible links in a yellow fever chain, these links being closely<lb/>
bound together by unnoticed cases among the natives, is not <unclear>mere</unclear> supposition.</p>
<p>The immunity of African races living in endemic centers, is in all<lb/>
probability an acquired, incomplete and temporary immunity that is continually<lb/>
renewed.</p>
<p>The two cases reported from the Gold Coast warrant the assertion that<lb/>
yellow fever can, without doubt, exist among natives.</p>
<p>On my visit to Ouidah on June 8th, I already had this possible origin<lb/>
of yellow fever in mind. Nothing suspicious from the point of view of mortality<lb/>
had been noted by the Commander of the settlement or the Doctor in Chief of the<lb/>
post. Following departmental instructions, a very careful investigation gave<lb/>
no further light on the subject. It is not very likely on the other hand, that<lb/>
the epidemic originated on the spot. Yellow fever had not appeared at Ouidah<lb/>
for many years and when <unclear>Anecho</unclear> and Grand-Popo were considered endemic centers,<lb/>
Ouidah was considered free.</p>
<p>It is therefore natural to suppose that an epidemic of yellow fever<lb/>
was created at Ouidah through some unnoticed connection with natives. As Dr.<lb/>
Valmorin remarks, control in this direction is almost impossible. After the<lb/>
appearance in June 1922 of a case of yellow fever and one European death at<lb/>
Grand-Popo, and another European case at <unclear>Anecho</unclear>, yellow fever so to speak did<lb/>

not cease to exist on the Gulf of Guinea, and the contamination doubtless was<lb/>
brought on through the intermediary of natives, because the different colonies<lb/>
have constant contact with each other by land routes immune from surveillance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately life among the natives is too much beyond our control<lb/>
for us to be posted on this subject from a medical point of view.</p>
<p>The cases notes by Dr. Trautmann at Cotonou are interesting and worthy<lb/>
of laboratory study. They do not however appear to have any connection with<lb/>
yellow fever. During April of this year I myself had an opportunity to note<lb/>
together with Dr. Trautmann ten similar cases which had occurred in the same<lb/>
circumstances and among natives from the same place.</p>
<p>Because of the fear that these might have been cases of ictero-<lb/>
hemorrhagic fever, they were even isolated in the Cotonou quarantine station,<lb/>
but following the only death occurring among them, I performed the autopsy<lb/>
which gave us the assurance that this was neither yellow fever nor ictero-<lb/>
hemorrhagic fever.</p>
