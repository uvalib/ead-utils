<salute>My dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is pleasant to get your<lb/>
letter of the 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and have news<lb/>
of you- It was a pleasant<lb/>
surprise when that dear wife<lb/>
of yours walked in the back<lb/>
gate and found me sitting on<lb/>
the terrace- It was very short<lb/>
tho. and I had not asked her<lb/>
half the things I wanted to<lb/>
know when the thunder growled<lb/>
and she said she had to run<lb/>
along, tho we would have loved<lb/>
to keep her to dinner-</p>
<p>Yes I found out all about the Schuler<lb/>
bust- There is no inscription under<lb/>
it now, but when I got hold of the<lb/>

WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
curator of the Old Museum building where<lb/>
it had been before you took it out to<lb/>
Walter Reed, he had a record of the<lb/>
inscription which had been on<lb/>
the pedestal- It was just what the<lb/>
Cubans had complained about<lb/>
&ldquo;that discovered and demonstrated<lb/>
in 1901 the transmission of yellow<lb/>
fever by mosquitos&rdquo;- It is the word<lb/>
<hi>discovered</hi> that they object to and<lb/>
justly I think- <hi>Demonstrated</hi> is<lb/>
unquestioned- I wrote to Dr. Fran-<lb/>
cisco Dominguez Roldan that that<lb/>
inscription had been removed<lb/>
seven years ago- His biography of-<lb/>
Finlay was published in 1933 for his<lb/>
centennial. It is nearly 300 pages<lb/>

in French and very well written-<lb/>
Though there is much special plead-<lb/>
ing and some distortion of facts-<lb/>
If you read French easily and want to<lb/>
read I will send it to you-<lb/>
Of course I want to read your<lb/>
story- I am just sitting around<lb/>
waiting for it- We will let Gen-<lb/>
Lawrence Reed it if you wish after<lb/>
Ireland and I are thru with it-<lb/>
Yes the late Dr Goldberger of the P.H.S.<lb/>
was the one who said said &ldquo;that<lb/>
Reed's work had converted a discredited<lb/>
hypothesis into an established doctrine&rdquo;<lb/>
That is the best answer to Dr Dominquez<lb/>
300 pages of excellent French-<lb/>
I have a little blank book 9"x5 1/2"<lb/>
in which for years I have copied<lb/>

references and short quotations and<lb/>
it is now a little thesaurus, like a bag of<lb/>
gems all mixed up- It always amused<lb/>
Winter with the odd references he<lb/>
would find in it- One of the last things<lb/>
I wrote in it was a brief account of the<lb/>
dinner gotten up by Guiteras of some 60<lb/>
of the prominent doctors of Havana to<lb/>
celebrate the demonstration by the Reed<lb/>
Board of the Finlay theory- It was on<lb/>
Dec. 22, 1900 Reed his two assistants Gorgas<lb/>
Gen. Wood and I were there- Dr. Domin-<lb/>
guez gives a full account of it in his book<lb/>
and says that Dr. Guiteras was sent by<lb/>
Gen. Wood to ask him to take charge<lb/>
of it and be the toast master- That is a<lb/>
little different from my recollection but<lb/>
it may be true-</p>
<p>I do not believe that Dr. Hench was at all<lb/>
offended at your comments on the Hem-<lb/>
meter photostats tho. some of them were a<lb/>
surprise to him as they were to me-<lb/>

But Hench is, I think, only anxious to<lb/>
bring out the truth in a fair scientific<lb/>
spirit and he is not is the business<lb/>
of making heroes- He has more-<lb/>
over much human charity and<lb/>
bears with philosophy the evidence<lb/>
of human weaknesses vanity, jea-<lb/>
lousy and twisting of the facts which<lb/>
he comes across in his painstaking<lb/>
sifting of all the evidence- I was<lb/>
surprised to find how often I had to<lb/>
answer &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo; to questions<lb/>
that I might reasonably be supposed<lb/>
to know- I saw a good deal of Agra-<lb/>
monte in the second Cuban Intervention<lb/>
and formed a better opinion of him<lb/>
than you have, but that does not<lb/>
make me object in any way to the<lb/>
opinions which you have formed on<lb/>
good grounds- If Hench has not written<lb/>

to you lately it has just happened<lb/>
so I am sure-</p>
<p>Have you seen the colored reproduc-<lb/>
tion of Cornwell's picture &ldquo;the Conquerors<lb/>
of Yellow Fever-&rdquo; Mrs. Leonard Wood<lb/>
sent us a copy of it as printed in<lb/>
the New York Mirror- I did not think<lb/>
it desirable to introduce so many<lb/>
figures but I must say that the<lb/>
artist has been more successful<lb/>
than I thought possible- I believe<lb/>
that it is to be printed in color<lb/>
with Hench's address at the unveiling<lb/>
of it at Cleveland - <del><unclear></unclear></del> in the<lb/>
A. M. A. Medical Magazine Hygeia for<lb/>
October- He has you there peeking<lb/>
over Agramonte's shoulder-so you<lb/>
must get a copy of it.</p>
<p>I had another visit from Miss Laura<lb/>
Wood- She tells me that her grandfather<lb/>
see back of page <hi>4</hi><lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06302077"/>
7<lb/>
came from Albemarle Co, <add>Va-</add> a well known<lb/>
family there, and she is a very intel-<lb/>
ligent woman- She told Cornelia<lb/>
that she was married but prefers<lb/>
in her literary work to use her<lb/>
maiden name-</p>
<p>When you write to Mrs Truby please<lb/>
tell her that when there is some<lb/>
interesting news I would like to<lb/>
hear it- I thought that you<lb/>
were coming on, this month-</p>
<p>Have you given that up?</p>
