Major Walter Reed,<lb/>
Surgeon, U. S. Army,<lb/>
Curator, Army Medical Museum,<lb/>
Surgeon General's Office, Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>As President of the Board constituted for the purpose of making<lb/>
investigations with reference to the infectious diseases prevailing in<lb/>
the island of Cuba (paragraph 34, S. O. 122, A. G. O., May 24, 1900), you<lb/>
will be governed by the following instructions:</p>
<p>This order does not relieve Acting Assistant Surgeons Lazear and<lb/>
Agramonte from the duties to which they are at present assigned, but they<lb/>
are expected to render such assistance as may be practicable in carrying<lb/>
out the investigations contemplated.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Cuba you should report in person to Major General<lb/>
Wood and inform him as to the objects of your investigation and the nature<lb/>
of your instructions. He will no doubt do everything in his power to as-<lb/>
sist you. I understand that there is a well-equipped laboratory at Camp<lb/>
Columbia, where Acting Assistant Surgeon Lazear is stationed, and another a<lb/>
Military Hospital Number One, where Acting Assistant Surgeon Agramonte is<lb/>
on duty. No doubt both of these laboratories will be placed at your dis-<lb/>
position, and you are at liberty to make your headquarters at either one<lb/>
which may seem to you best suited for your purpose.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f02024002"/>
<p>You will naturally give special attention to questions relating<lb/>
to the etiology and prevention of yellow fever. As you are familiar<lb/>
with what has already been done by other bacteriologists in this field<lb/>
of investigation, I do not consider it necessary to give you any sug-<lb/>
gestions or detailed instructions. But it is evident that the most<lb/>
important question which will occupy your attention is that which re-<lb/>
lates to the etiology of this disease.</p>
<p>You will also take advantage of such opportunities as may offer<lb/>
for the study of other infectious diseases, and especially of the ma-<lb/>
larial fevers prevailing in the island of Cuba. An important question<lb/>
in connection with the diseases of tropical and semi-tropical countries<lb/>
relates to the etiology of febrile attacks of short duration to which<lb/>
strangers are especially subject. Should you have time there will be<lb/>
ample opportunity for the study of leprosy, in the Leper's Hospital in<lb/>
the city of Havana. Attention should also be given to the infectious<lb/>
diseases of the lower animals, in case any such prevail, the etiology<lb/>
of which has not been definitely determined.</p>
<p>You are authorized to obtain from the Medical Supply Depot in Havana<lb/>
such articles as you may require, upon requisitions approved by the Chief<lb/>
Surgeon, Division of Cuba. Necessary articles not on hand in that Depot<lb/>
should be called for upon special requisitions to be sent to this office.</p>

from Sternberg to Reed -<lb/>
most interesting!<lb/>
notice how extremely<lb/>
