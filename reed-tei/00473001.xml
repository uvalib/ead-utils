<salute>My dear Mrs. Lazear,</salute>
</opener>
<p>On my return from Europe I find your letter waiting<lb/>
for me. I have the story of the episode of Dean's infection<lb/>
from several sources, all of which agree on it. You can read<lb/>
it in detail in Dr. Agramonte's pamphlet called, as I remember,<lb/>
&ldquo;The Inside Story of a Great Medical Experiment.&rdquo; I have that<lb/>
pamphlet in photostat copy and will be glad to send it to you<lb/>
if I can find it and if you care to see it, though I am sure<lb/>
you can see it in any good medical library. The only liberty<lb/>
I took with the scene was to add Dr. Finlay to it.</p>
<p>The play is to be published on or about the first of<lb/>
June and I shall have a copy sent to you. You may well find it<lb/>
a most unsympathetic piece of work, because I have not made any<lb/>
attempt at drawing portraits of the originals insofar as their<lb/>
personal characteristics, appearance or habits of speech are<lb/>
concerned. If you will reflect you will realize that I should<lb/>
have failed had I attempted to do so. No one can tell an<lb/>
outsider what any individual whom the outsider has not known<lb/>
was really like. It is a problem which has not come up before<lb/>
in the writing of historical plays because I do not know another<lb/>
historical play of which it can be said that the characters of<lb/>
the play and their friends and relatives both lived on into the<lb/>
time of the play's production.</p>
<p>I suppose that your letter has reference to some<lb/>
notices of which I have heard (I sailed from New York immediately<lb/>
after the production and am therefore out of touch with most of<lb/>
what has been written about the play) but I can assure you that<lb/>
the play and the characters, notably your husband, made a very<lb/>
profound impression upon a great number of people. Robert Keith,<lb/>
who played Dr. Lazear on the stage, brought to his playing the<lb/>
finest reverence and enthusiasm I have ever seen in an actor.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Faithfully yours,</salute>
<signed>Sidney Howard</signed>.
Mrs. Jesse W. Lazear.<lb/>
