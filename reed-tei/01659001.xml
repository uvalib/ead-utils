</opener>
<p>You will<lb/>
see, by the date of this letter, that<lb/>
I write on Friday, contrary<lb/>
to my usual custom. Now, do<lb/>
not proceed, at once, to accuse<lb/>
me of carelessness, but hear<lb/>
my reason. Well, here it is.<lb/>
Wednesday afternoon, when<lb/>
the steamer, Henry Smith, ar-<lb/>
rived at Willet's Point, I<lb/>
received a letter from Dr<lb/>
Torney, begging me to come<lb/>
down to Fort Wood, by<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01659002"/>
return steamer, and spend<lb/>
the night with him. His little<lb/>
boy was quite sick, and as<lb/>
his parental solicitude had<lb/>
clouded his own judgement,<lb/>
he was anxious that I should<lb/>
see the little fellow. Of course,<lb/>
I made haste to comply, and<lb/>
5 o'clock found me under<lb/>
his roof- Fortunately, Master<lb/>
Torney was not very sick<lb/>
and I was <add>soon</add> able to dispel<lb/>
the father's fears. I had the<lb/>
pleasure of a long conver-<lb/>
sation with Mrs. T., who<lb/>
is a very agreeable soul &amp;<lb/>
improves on acquaintance.<lb/>
She, by the way, made many<lb/>
inquiries concerning &ldquo;Miss<lb/>
Lawrence&rdquo;; how I enjoyed<lb/>
my recent visit; when I<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01659003"/>
expected to go again; when<lb/>
I was going to get married,<lb/>
etc, etc. The Dr &amp; I sat up<lb/>
till a late hour, talking<lb/>
over past times, &amp; discussing<lb/>
the probable chances of fu-<lb/>
ture promotion, &amp; estimating<lb/>
the number of Surgeons who<lb/>
would probably <hi>die</hi> within<lb/>
the next twenty years; &amp; other<lb/>
such innocent amuse-<lb/>
ments. Leaving the Fort, at<lb/>
10 o'clock the next morning,<lb/>
we went to Army Headquar-<lb/>
ters &amp; had a conversation<lb/>
with General Cuyler- He told<lb/>
me that I would be likely<lb/>
to remain at this Post for<lb/>
3 or 4 months longer- Still<lb/>
he did not know positive-<lb/>
ly- 'Tis a satisfaction to<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01659004"/>
know even this. Should I<lb/>
stay as long as Gen. C. in-<lb/>
timated, I will make every ef-<lb/>
fort to come to see my own,<lb/>
darling E.; &amp; should I be<lb/>
ordered away within this<lb/>
period, I will try my best<lb/>
to make a certain little<lb/>
town lie in my journey's<lb/>
way, if it be to stop only<lb/>
for a day. I <hi>must</hi> see my<lb/>
little sweetheart before the<lb/>
Spring returns, or else I<lb/>
may forget how she looks,<lb/>
&amp; that would be a misfortune.<lb/>
Returning from the City, I did<lb/>
not reach my Post till<lb/>
evening, &amp; so much fatigued<lb/>
as to be compelled <add>to forego</add> the pleasure<lb/>
of writing till this morning-<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01659005"/>
I hope the foregoing excuse<lb/>
will be favorably entertained<lb/>
as I have no better to offer.<lb/>
The letter, that you hoped<lb/>
I would never get, arrived,<lb/>
as you have already learned.<lb/>
It was a very sweet &amp; ac-<lb/>
ceptable letter, but since<lb/>
you desired that it would<lb/>
be lost on its way, of<lb/>
course, I cannot appreciate<lb/>
<add>it</add> as much- Why did you<lb/>
say, my darling, that you<lb/>
would enclose a &ldquo;tiny flower&rdquo;<lb/>
in your letter, &amp; then fail to<lb/>
do so? Was it in order<lb/>
to excite my curiosity &amp; give<lb/>
me something to do by search<lb/>
ing for it? Or did you change<lb/>
your mind &amp; conclude to<lb/>
present it to Mr Myrick?<lb/>
I<del>m</del> am sure, that he deserved<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01659006"/>
some favor, at your hands,<lb/>
after having given you<lb/>
such a pleasant ride &amp;<lb/>
gathered you so many beau-<lb/>
tiful flowers, which <hi>I</hi> had<lb/>
refused to pluck for you-<lb/>
'Twas but just that you<lb/>
should thus reward him,<lb/>
and I heartily commend your<lb/>
action- Yet I must confess <add>that</add><lb/>
I am sorry that you could<lb/>
not spare so much as <hi>one</hi><lb/>
little blo<del>o</del><add>s</add>som for me. It would<lb/>
have been cherished so fondly<lb/>
&amp; tenderly. But never mind,<lb/>
my darling, <del>my darling</del>, per-<lb/>
haps, you know what is best,<lb/>
&amp;, it may be, that the crumbs<lb/>
are good enough for <hi>me</hi>.<lb/>
I was really charmed to hear<lb/>
that you were so pleased<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01659007"/>
<add>with</add> your buggy-ride with Mr M.<lb/>
'Tis a consolation to know<lb/>
that you can -- well, I won't<lb/>
finish the sentence, my little<lb/>
E, as I forgot what I was go-<lb/>
ing to say, and I know you<lb/>
can never decipher it. The<lb/>
time was when you would<lb/>
even have enjoyed a ride<lb/>
with your humble servant,<lb/>
by your side- Pardon me,<lb/>
if this smacks of conceit! But<lb/>
this was in the days gone<lb/>
by, when you had not heard<lb/>
any declaration, on my part,<lb/>
&amp; when you were not so<lb/>
easily displeased at my<lb/>
numerous mistakes, or, at<lb/>
least, were inclined to overlook<lb/>
them. Well a day! how blind,<lb/>
how blind, have we been!<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01659008"/>
&ldquo;'Twas ever thus,&rdquo; etc. But enough<lb/>
of <hi>foolishness</hi>, for when I turn<lb/>
back &amp; read what I have written,<lb/>
so <hi>scilly</hi>, so <hi>false</hi> is it, that my<lb/>
very soul is sickened by it!<lb/>
Yet, does not &ldquo;<hi>Irony</hi>&rdquo; beget &ldquo;<hi>Irony</hi>&rdquo;?<lb/>
All joking <add>aside,</add> my own, sweet Emilie,<lb/>
you did not send me the flower,<lb/>
for the most thorough search<lb/>
failed to discover it- Yet I do not<lb/>
despair of receiving it &amp; shall ex-<lb/>
pect, at least <hi>two</hi> in my next-<lb/>
Have you made the acquaintance<lb/>
of Miss Peace, as yet? If so, give<lb/>
me your opinion of the <hi>fair</hi><lb/>
damsel- Perhaps, she can tell you<lb/>
something of my early career that<lb/>
you would be interesting- Who knows?</p>
<p>Adieu, my darling,</p>
<closer>
<salute>As ever, your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
