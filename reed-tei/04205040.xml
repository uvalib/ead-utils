<salute>My dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 15th. The<lb/>
package containing the plans of the hospital reached me some days after<lb/>
receipt of your first letter and I have gone over them and quite agree with<lb/>
you that it will be necessary to secure still earlier plans if we are to<lb/>
definitely locate the room in which Walter Reed died.</p>
<p>I have just come from a visit with General Lawrence Reed and, as it<lb/>
happened, Blossom was visiting them. They all agreed with you and with<lb/>
Gen. Kean and myself that in view of the many changes that have occurred in<lb/>
the inside plans of the building, it will be wise to limit the placing of<lb/>
the plaques to one on the outside of the building itself. However, in a short<lb/>
time I shall go down to Fort Leslie J. McNair and try to secure earlier plans<lb/>
of the hospital and it may be possible for us to locate the room more exactly.</p>
<p>As I wrote you several days ago, I got in touch with Gen. McCoy and he<lb/>
will be glad to see Dr. Hench. I have not yet heard from the latter but I<lb/>
read in the newspaper that he is to address a medical society meeting here<lb/>
tonight and I hope to get in touch with him sometime today and arrange to see<lb/>
him tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>In talking with General Reed and Blossom they both told me that there<lb/>
evidently must be some mixup in the matter of Walter Reed being pulled off<lb/>
the work in Cuba and sent to the Philippines. Blossom remembers very dis-<lb/>
tinctly that her father had been here in Washington for a somewhat long<lb/>
period of time and it became necessary to order him elsewhere in order to<lb/>
comply with the regulations at that time. General Sternberg in the spring<lb/>
of <unclear>1900</unclear> ordered him to the Philippines but before he could comply with that<lb/>
order he was sent down to Cuba to investigate a outbreak of yellow fever in<lb/>
one of the companies of one of the regiments on duty there. Following that<lb/>
temporary duty, the order to the Philippines was held up and he was ordered<lb/>
to Cuba as a member of the Board. Blossom says that so far as she knows,<lb/>
no effort was made to carry out the order to the Philippines during the course<lb/>
of his work in Cuba. It is quite possible that we can get some further in-<lb/>
formation concerning this matter from General McCoy.</p>
<p>Talk to Hench<lb/>
<hi><unclear></unclear></hi> this.</p>
<p>Within a few days I will be glad to take up with the Office of the Sur-<lb/>
geon General the matter of the location of your books. I do hope that it will<lb/>
be possible for you to come to Washington for the Walter Reed Celebration and<lb/>
it is possible that Sawyer will have sufficient funds to pay your expenses.<lb/>
This he will know within a short time and he will advise you accordingly.</p>
<p>I shall write you further after I have seen Dr. Hench.</p>
