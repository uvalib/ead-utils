Dr. Jesse W. Lazear,<lb/>
835 Park Ave., Baltimore, Md.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>We understand your desire to sell the Denniston<lb/>
Avenue property either as a whole or in parts, and therefore it would<lb/>
probably be well to reserve the right to sell the corner lot in fixing<lb/>
or arranging a lease from April. At the present time the whole premises<lb/>
are included in the lease, and probably the house would not rent at the<lb/>
present rate if both lots were not included. In case you sold off the<lb/>
corner lot and there should be a building put on it, it would make your<lb/>
house very dark, for that which perhaps more than anything else adds to<lb/>
the desirability of your house is the fact that it has an open lot at<lb/>
the side, and the tenant therefore has the use of the side lot, as well<lb/>
as the benefit of light and air therefrom. But of course in selling the<lb/>
side lot it would have to be in a way not to greatly damage or interfere<lb/>
with your house. Your house in built back from the street line several<lb/>
feet, and if you should sell the corner lot and the owner thereof should<lb/>
build out on the street line, it would very greatly injure your house,<lb/>
and therefore when the corner lot is improved, the building thereon<lb/>
should not extend beyond the front line of your house. Then again, if<lb/>
the corner lot is sold, it would probably be wise to reserve a 4 foot<lb/>
alley. The property consists of 2 lots, 24 feet each, and your house<lb/>
covers one full lot, and therefore if you would sell the other full lot,<lb/>
there would be no space between your house and the other property, hence<lb/>
we believe if you sold the corner lot, it would be better to sell about<lb/>
20 feet, and that would then give an entrance way from the front, <add>as</add> <del>as well</del><lb/>
well <add>as</add> <del>as</del> arrange for light and air along the side of your present house.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00278002"/>
<p>Dr. Lazear</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>It might, however, be better not to sell the corner lot until you<lb/>
had sold the house, for it may be hard to sell the corner lot and have it<lb/>
improved in a way that will not damage or injure not only the salability<lb/>
but the renting of your house, and the lot will at any time sell much<lb/>
more readily at all events than the house and lot, hence we would suggest<lb/>
that it would be better to try and push the sale of the house with a lot<lb/>
say 27 or 28 feet front, and not sell the corner lot until after the<lb/>
house is sold. Up to the present time there has not been great demand<lb/>
for houses of that class in the last few years, for newer and more modern<lb/>
houses in newer and more modern districts have drawn the attention of<lb/>
house buyers, and the older houses are hard to sell unless the price is<lb/>
made an inducement.</p>
<p>Please pardon us for these suggestions, as we lay them before you<lb/>
only as a matter of information and so that you may direct us how we<lb/>
are to follow this matter up for your best interests, it being our desire<lb/>
to accomplish that as well as do what is your pleasure in the case.</p>

<salute>Yours Very Respectfully,</salute>
