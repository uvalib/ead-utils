<p>&ldquo;In November, 1931, Dr. - -, an interne at the - Hospital,<lb/>
told Dr. - that he had Walter Reed's notebook of cases of yellow<lb/>
fever. Before Dr. - brought the book to me, I heard, third-handed,<lb/>
that when he was working as a medical student one summer at the Army<lb/>
Medical Library, he had rescued the book from an ash barrel. He told<lb/>
me, however, that this notebook was amongst the things at the<lb/>
Medical School which had been sent by the Medical Department of the<lb/>
Army, and that he had recovered it as it was being thrown out. One of<lb/>
his instructors had said he might have it. I felt that the proper<lb/>
home for the MS. was at the Army Medical Library or the Walter Reed<lb/>
Medical Centre. Dr. - had tried without success, he said, to com-<lb/>
municate by telephone with the authorities at the latter place. He<lb/>
asked several thousand dollars, but on advice of the Library Committee,<lb/>
I offered twenty-five with permission to go up to fifty. The book was<lb/>
in my safe for some time, then taken away by Dr. - . Towards the end<lb/>
of April, 1932, he telephoned, saying he would take what I had offered,<lb/>
namely, twenty-five dollars. It is the laboratory book of Dr. Walter<lb/>
Reed, and besides other notes, gives the urine findings of the group of<lb/>
men who voluntarily submitted to inoculation with yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;13 May 1932&rdquo;</p>
<p>----------------------------</p>
<p>General F. F. Russell came to see me on or about 12 January 1933,<lb/>
and said that part of the book was certainly in Sergeant Neate's hand.<lb/>
Neate was a technician to Reed. Later Neate took an M.D. and was a<lb/>
competent pathologist.</p>
<p>A short time later General Russell's secretary sent the following<lb/>
to be used in wording a label for the notebook:</p>
<p>"<hi>Walter Reed and Laboratory Notebook</hi><lb/>
"Dr. Russell says a good way to label the book is<lb/>
"Record of the Yellow Fever Commission's Work in<lb/>
the handwriting of Dr. Neate<lb/>
"Dr. Neate was laboratory assistant to Dr. Reed<lb/>
and the book is a record of the Commission's work in<lb/>
Havana.<lb/>
&ldquo;Dr. Russell says when the laboratory was broken<lb/>
up some employee in the building probably got hold of<lb/>
it and had the idea of selling it.&rdquo;</p>
