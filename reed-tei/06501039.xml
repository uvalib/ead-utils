Brig. General Albert Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco, California<lb/>
<salute>Dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just heard from a friend back<lb/>
East that you now reside in California, so being close by<lb/>
in Berkeley, thought I would write to you.</p>
<p>It is quite unlikely that you will re-<lb/>
member me out of the thousands of Hospital Corpsmen you<lb/>
have been in contact with during your long service in the<lb/>
Medical Department of the Army, but as I served under you<lb/>
during your first command, at Columbia Barracks, Cuba, and<lb/>
remember you quite well and favorably, I am going to write<lb/>
to you anyway.</p>
<p>I was at Pinar del Rio during the Yellow<lb/>
Fever (diagnosed Pernicious Malaria) episode there, and<lb/>
later came to Columbia Barracks and served there from be-<lb/>
ginning to end of the experiments of Major Reed's Board.<lb/>
So I served under you and Captain Stark.</p>
<p>I was a clerk at Pinar del Rio and held<lb/>
the same job at Columbia Barracks Hospital, keeping the<lb/>
S. &amp; W. Reports, Pay Rolls, etc. I was studying for Asst.<lb/>
Hospl. Steward at the time and passed with a very high<lb/>
percentage, but was rejected because the examining board,<lb/>
(Contract Doctors) found I had slight mitral insufficiency.</p>
<p>Captain Stark told me that no Regular Army<lb/>
Board would have ever considered that sufficient reason<lb/>
for rejection, and if so, would not have allowed me to take<lb/>
the rest of the examination, which this Board did.</p>
<p>I am one of the men in the picture in<lb/>
which you appear, taken on the hospital steps at Columbia<lb/>
Barracks. I was sent to Fort Bayard, N. M. from Quemados<lb/>
and reenlisted there. There I came down with a bad case of<lb/>
Bacillary Dysentary, brought in my system from Cuba. Major<lb/>
Appel, Hospital Commander, said it was the worst case he<lb/>
ever saw that survived. I was his pet show-off to other<lb/>
doctors for quite awhile!</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06501040"/>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>I took all dictation from doctors at monthly ex-<lb/>
amination of tubercular patients and made out all the charts.<lb/>
Later was personal<del>l</del> clerk to Major Appel.</p>
<p>I have read all the books written about the Yel-<lb/>
low Fever experiments, and your book, I am happy to say,<lb/>
is the only real, factual account of that great event. Most<lb/>
of the others were written by people who were not there.</p>
<p>I was in a position there to learn a great deal<lb/>
about things, and knew everyone connected with the experi-<lb/>
ment, and in my opinion no one has written so truthfully<lb/>
and comprehensively of this event as yourself.</p>
<p>I read the book at the Public Library here. You<lb/>
know, I'd give anything to have a copy of that book for<lb/>
myself as a memento of that great time. Honestly, I hate<lb/>
to write this, but I wonder, I wonder, if you have a copy<lb/>
of it you could spare? You can realize what it would mean<lb/>
to me to have a copy signed by yourself. It would surely<lb/>
be a treasured possesion.</p>
<p>I congratulate you on your achievements in the<lb/>
Army and your deserved promotions to the highest rank,<lb/>
and it makes me feel like old times to know that my old<lb/>
C. O. is in the same great State of California with me.</p>
<p>With very best Wishes,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Cordially &amp; Sincerely Yours,</salute>
<signed>Paul L. Tate<lb/>
formerly Private, H. Corps, U.S. Army</signed>
