Fort Apache, A.T.<lb/>
<date value="1879-07-09">July 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1879.</date>
(Wednesday afternoon)<lb/>
</dateline>
<salute>My own precious little Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>While<lb/>
the rain is pouring down out of<lb/>
doors &amp; the glad, dry earth is<lb/>
so busy drinking it all, I am<lb/>
going to sit down and see if<lb/>
I can't amuse my &ldquo;ittle teffie&rdquo;<lb/>
in writing to my precious lovie,<lb/>
Emilie Lawrence Reed! This, my<lb/>
duckie dear, is the first <hi>rain</hi>, that<lb/>
could be designated by that name,<lb/>
that we have had this summer.<lb/>
Week after week the clouds<lb/>
have been displaying their for-<lb/>
ces in great, black, heavy<lb/>
masses, hanging over &amp; beyond<lb/>
&ldquo;old baldy&rdquo;; &amp; notwithstanding<lb/>
that the poor, brown, dry, sun-<lb/>
-parched earth seemed to cry<lb/>
aloud for just a few clear<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01748002"/>
cooling drops, none have fallen.<lb/>
Petou, the Indian, whom you re-<lb/>
-member, came into the Post about<lb/>
10 days ago &amp; said that he had<lb/>
been up into the mountains and<lb/>
had a talk with the Lord, the<lb/>
subject of the conversation being<lb/>
the excessively dry season, and he<lb/>
said he was told by the Lord<lb/>
that he would send rain in<lb/>
six days from that time- It<lb/>
did not rain within six, but<lb/>
it came pretty near it- It was<lb/>
at least encouraging to us<lb/>
to know that the Lord, had even<lb/>
promised it to Pet&oacute;u. Now and<lb/>
from this time forth, the festive<lb/>
morning-glory will rouse him-<lb/>
-self from his slumbers and<lb/>
with much agility cast his<lb/>
tender tendrils about the twine<lb/>
strings which the &ldquo;Nuncio&rdquo; has<lb/>
provided- You &ldquo;jess&rdquo; ought to<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01748003"/>
see my front porch and yard, my<lb/>
dovie, lovie, dearie, sweetie, lifie,<lb/>
wifie! The &ldquo;hop, skip &amp; jump&rdquo; vines<lb/>
have flourished exceedingly- They<lb/>
cover the front &amp; sides of the porch and<lb/>
the front of the house very nicely.<lb/>
And old mantee has so arranged<lb/>
the strings over the two side gates<lb/>
that they present the appearance of<lb/>
two arched door-ways leading into<lb/>
some charming jessamine-cov-<lb/>
-ered &amp; rose-scented bower!<lb/>
&ldquo;Hesche&rdquo;! ain't old &ldquo;Teesigon&rdquo; talk-<lb/>
ing &ldquo;weal&rdquo; poetically for once<lb/>
in his life? And then your old<lb/>
hubby dear, whom you love more<lb/>
than you love yourself, &amp; whom<lb/>
to have sitting on your lap (I<lb/>
mean, &ldquo;yousig in <hi>his</hi> lapsig)&rdquo; this<lb/>
moment, you would give <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>10 &amp; ask<lb/>
no questions; as I was &ldquo;a going<lb/>
to remark&rdquo; your old ugly mantee<lb/>
has stretched a string across the<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01748004"/>
front door, from one side of<lb/>
the porch to the other, &amp; on this &ldquo;cordon&rdquo;<lb/>
(Oh! I beg pardon, I meant to say<lb/>
<hi>string</hi>) he has trained a hop vine<lb/>
which runs right over the door<lb/>
in the shape of a lovely &ldquo;solferina<lb/>
rainbow&rdquo;! <hi>Ain't</hi> that &ldquo;weal&rdquo; pretty,<lb/>
now, lovie, dovie, wiggie, piggie!<lb/>
I tell you, &ldquo;I'se Jess dot fings<lb/>
ooking mitey boofersigs, <hi>I is</hi>&rdquo;!<lb/>
But then, after all, there's something<lb/>
<hi>very</hi> important wanting; and that's<lb/>
<hi>you</hi>, my own joy &amp; hope! &ldquo;I'se<lb/>
dot&rdquo; all these pretty &ldquo;fings&rdquo;, but<lb/>
I &ldquo;hain't dot&rdquo; no &ldquo;ittle oomsey&rdquo; to en-<lb/>
-joy them &amp; admire them with me!<lb/>
no little darling to walk around in<lb/>
the yard, gathering the morning-<lb/>
-glories which her artistic eye<lb/>
tells are the most beautiful, at<lb/>
the same time that she holds up<lb/>
her snow-white skirts &amp; displays<lb/>
for mantee's own benefit, a pair<lb/>
of <hi>lovely little ankles</hi>! the very<lb/>
same darling ankles that you used<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01748005"/>
to in years gone by, stick out<lb/>
from under your white, flowing<lb/>
morning-wrapper just to <hi>tantalize</hi><lb/>
your old mantee! Now, <hi>you did</hi>,<lb/>
lovie, &amp; there ain't no use to try<lb/>
to deny it! I was right there and<lb/>
I &ldquo;jess&rdquo; know all about it! &ldquo;<hi>Boo-</hi><lb/>
-digs&rdquo;, Miss Emilie Lawrence!<lb/>
No I ain't &ldquo;dot&rdquo; no wifie, dear, here,<lb/>
&amp; it takes away the enjoyment<lb/>
from everything- I &ldquo;jess&rdquo; going straight<lb/>
out into that yard &amp; pull them all<lb/>
down! But, no, on second thought,<lb/>
I'll let them stay, &amp; tend them for<lb/>
my darling wife's sake- I'll consid-<lb/>
-er them hers, and I'll nurse them, oh!<lb/>
so gently &amp; faithfully &amp; when they<lb/>
look pretty, they will remind me<lb/>
of her &amp; make me happy- and if<lb/>
anybody dares touch those &ldquo;hop,<lb/>
skip &amp; jump&rdquo; vines <hi>now</hi>, since<lb/>
they are my lovie's; if anybody<lb/>
lays a hand on one of those<lb/>
&ldquo;evening prides&rdquo; (I beg pardon <add>lovie</add><lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01748006"/>
&ldquo;morning glories&rdquo;) I'll &ldquo;jess&rdquo; kick him<lb/>
right where he sits down! <hi>Now</hi><lb/>
Do you want to know, sweetest<lb/>
wifie in the world, what your old<lb/>
&ldquo;hub's&rdquo; been doing to-day? Well,<lb/>
he's been down to the garden for<lb/>
a little ride &amp; to see how every<lb/>
thing is growing. His cabbage,<lb/>
onions &amp; corn look very nice now,<lb/>
and he hopes to have the pleasure<lb/>
of &ldquo;cologning&rdquo; his breath, so to<lb/>
speak, frequently with the &ldquo;sa-<lb/>
voyittas&rdquo; (I beg pardon, lovie, I<lb/>
meant to say &ldquo;onions&rdquo;.) Confound this<lb/>
old spanish language! it keeps<lb/>
on running between me, &amp; mi<lb/>
queridisima esposa (I beg par-<lb/>
don, lovie, I mean, my dearest wifie&rdquo;,)<lb/>
well, the fact<del>s</del> of the matter is,<lb/>
I guess I &ldquo;jess&rdquo; as well let the<lb/>
&ldquo;cat out of the bag&rdquo; anyhow!<lb/>
Mrs Harrison is taking Spanish<lb/>
lessons <hi>from me</hi>! what<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01748007"/>
<hi>do</hi> you think of that, Emilie, dear?<lb/>
I gave her one lesson last Thurs-<lb/>
day, &amp; another this morning, and of<lb/>
all of the &ldquo;tiene usted mi som-<lb/>
brero&rdquo; you ever heard, occurred<lb/>
then &amp; there each time! We take<lb/>
our lesson on the front porch<lb/>
at Captain Hentig's or in his<lb/>
dining-room, &amp; all the time Mrs.<lb/>
Hentig is keeping up such a<lb/>
ding - do<add>n</add>gging on the piano that<lb/>
we can't hear our ears! Oh!<lb/>
I &ldquo;spec&rdquo; I forgot to tell you that<lb/>
Mrs. Hentig is very enthusias-<lb/>
tic on the subject of music-<lb/>
instrumental music- She began, a<lb/>
week ago, to take lessons from<lb/>
Gomez, the trumpeter, and practices<lb/>
<hi>3 hours every</hi> day! The Captain<lb/>
has promised her that he will<lb/>
give her <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>20.00 a month, for<lb/>
every month she practices, pro-<lb/>
vided she plays <hi>3 hours</hi> a day!<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01748008"/>
The consequence<del>s</del> is that you can<lb/>
hear <add>at</add> all hours of the day soft<lb/>
&amp; sweet fragments of operas<lb/>
&amp; other &ldquo;ditties&rdquo; floating through<lb/>
the circumambient atmosphere!<lb/>
Mrs. H. says she wants to take up<lb/>
<hi>painting</hi> one of these days!<lb/>
Now, I'll tell you what, my lovie,<lb/>
<hi>I'll</hi> do. If <hi>you</hi> will practice<lb/>
<hi>one</hi> hour every <hi>other</hi> day, during<lb/>
the two months you are in H'burg,<lb/>
I'll give you <hi><hi rend="superscript">$</hi>40.00</hi> a month!<lb/>
Now what do you say to that, my<lb/>
darling lovie? &ldquo;<hi>Boodigs</hi>&rdquo;! Just here,<lb/>
I hear a knock at the door, &amp; on go-<lb/>
-ing out I find Mrs. Harrison<lb/>
with a nice plate of spring<lb/>
cabbage, (raw) with mayonnaise<lb/>
dressing - &amp; a nice, slice of bread-<lb/>
I never tasted anything better,<lb/>
&amp; am now fairly munching<lb/>
it down - I told Mrs. H, that<lb/>
I was writing to you- She said<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01748009"/>
&ldquo;give my very best love to Mrs.<lb/>
Reed &amp; the baby, &amp; tell her, now<lb/>
that she is in the valley &amp; has<lb/>
plenty of spare time, she must<lb/>
be sure to write me a long let-<lb/>
ter&rdquo;- And I wish you would,<lb/>
lovie, for Mrs. H. thinks a heap<lb/>
of you- Well! I sat down to<lb/>
write four pages &amp; I've com-<lb/>
menced the ninth already- This<lb/>
will never do, dovie- If I go<lb/>
on at this rate, every day, I can't<lb/>
get it all in an envelope-<lb/>
So I must stop for to-day- Ill<lb/>
&ldquo;jess&rdquo; say one or two things before<lb/>
I close- Firstly, you'se the swee-<lb/>
-test, dearest, best little wifie<lb/>
that ever lived, &amp; <hi>our</hi> little boy,<lb/>
Laurie, is the best-looking, &amp; sweet-<lb/>
est little boy that ever lived!<lb/>
Secondly- I love's you both bet-<lb/>
-ter <del>the</del> to-day than I did yesterday<lb/>
and I couldn't love you any better to-day<lb/>
than I did yesterday to save me! &ldquo;Boodigs&rdquo;!<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01748010"/>
Thursday, 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 2 P.M. well! here  I &ldquo;is<lb/>
agin&rdquo;, my lovie, with my old &ldquo;pen-<lb/>
sig,&rdquo; sitting at my writing table<lb/>
in what used to be my little dar-<lb/>
-ling's sweet, pretty parlor, all ar-<lb/>
-ranged by her darling little self;<lb/>
and &ldquo;I'se dot&rdquo; both feet planted<lb/>
on the Navahoe blanket which<lb/>
adorns the floor so uniquely -<lb/>
I don't know what &ldquo;I'se a going&rdquo;<lb/>
to write about, for I &ldquo;writ&rdquo; out<lb/>
on that <hi>nine</hi> pages yesterday.<lb/>
If I had the busy hum of<lb/>
Civilization &ldquo;a roaring&rdquo; about<lb/>
my carcass like my sweet &ldquo;ittle<lb/>
oomsey&rdquo; has, I could write real<lb/>
long, interesting letters just<lb/>
like those my darling does write<lb/>
&amp; which please her poor old<lb/>
Mantee's heart <hi>so much</hi>. <hi> Love</hi><lb/>
her precious heart! Every <hi>inch</hi> of<lb/>
of her darling <hi>soul</hi> &amp; <hi>body</hi>, for she<lb/>
is mantee's hope, pride &amp; joy!<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01748011"/>
But as I &ldquo;hain't dot&rdquo; the &ldquo;husy<lb/>
bum,&rdquo; (I beg pardon, lovie, I mean<lb/>
&ldquo;busy hum,&rdquo;) but only the ever<del>y</del><lb/>
recurring monotony of a frontier<lb/>
garrison, I &ldquo;jess&rdquo; has to &ldquo; scratch<lb/>
my old pate mighty hard to turn<lb/>
up a few ideas. One &ldquo;fing&rdquo; is<lb/>
very sure, and that is, if I ain't<lb/>
&ldquo;dot&rdquo; no news, &ldquo;Is'e<hi>so crazy</hi><lb/>
to see my little Emilie, wifie,<lb/>
that I must talk to her with<lb/>
my pen, or I'll have a duck fit!<lb/>
my, what <hi>would</hi> I not give, if<lb/>
my little lovie was over in the<lb/>
old bed-room across the hall,<lb/>
and our little Laurie in his Crib,<lb/>
singing &ldquo;<hi>dah</hi>! <hi>dah</hi>! <hi>dah</hi>! Oh!<lb/>
if you were only there, my dovie,<lb/>
I'd <hi>fly</hi> to your arms &amp; press your<lb/>
pure, sweet lips with many<lb/>
a passionate kiss of deepest<lb/>
love ! But you are not there,<lb/>
lovie, and poor, old &ldquo;teesigon&rdquo; could<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01748012"/>
almost cry over your absence!<lb/>
But he thinks &amp; believes that his<lb/>
two &ldquo;apple dumplings&rdquo; are happy<lb/>
East &amp; enjoying so many luxuries<lb/>
of which they have been deprived,<lb/>
&amp; so he won't cry any, my lovie.<lb/>
When mantee looks around this<lb/>
old room, he scarcely recognizes<lb/>
it, so different does it appear<lb/>
from that bright, cheerful room<lb/>
which my darling had for me.<lb/>
Mr Mills remarked a few <add>days</add> ago that<lb/>
the change was wonderful- He<lb/>
said, the first time he entered,<lb/>
our parlor, he was struck with<lb/>
the beauty &amp; brightness that per-<lb/>
-vaded the whole, and admired<lb/>
your taste for effect very much.<lb/>
I'll just bet one &ldquo;peso&rdquo; that<lb/>
there isn't a lady in the Army<lb/>
who can arrange a room more<lb/>
beautifully than my little darling,<lb/>
if you will only give her the<lb/>
materials- And old mantee &amp; little<lb/>
oomsey are <hi>going to get the materials</hi>!<lb/>
<pb n="13" id="f01748013"/>
Aint we going to have a <hi>sweet</hi><lb/>
little home at our next Post,<lb/>
Emilie, lovie? and ain't we going<lb/>
to have a <hi>pretty</hi> little home too,<lb/>
my precious wifie? and ain't there<lb/>
going to be a precious, pretty,<lb/>
cheerful little wifie to preside<lb/>
over it? and a darling little Laurie<lb/>
to make all things about it so<lb/>
merry &amp; joyful with his dear,<lb/>
innocent prattle? And ain't old<lb/>
&ldquo;hubby&rdquo; going to be a dear,<lb/>
affectionate old mantee, and<lb/>
wear <hi>real good clothes too</hi>?<lb/>
Ain't we going to have <hi>all</hi> these<lb/>
things and <hi>many more</hi>, if the Good<lb/>
Lord spares our lives- Oh! I<lb/>
so love to picture in my mind<lb/>
our bright, happy home with<lb/>
precious &ldquo;oomsey&rdquo; and darling &ldquo;bad<lb/>
daddies&rdquo; &amp; old &ldquo;mantee&rdquo; all there,<lb/>
and <hi>love</hi> overruling all in<lb/>
&amp; about it! Heaven grant that<lb/>
my longing eyes may look upon so happy<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f01748014"/>
a home!</p>
<p><hi><del>Friday</del></hi><add>Saturday</add> <hi>Morning</hi>, <hi>July 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi> - If old mantee<lb/>
consulted his own feelings, this<lb/>
morning, he would postpone his<lb/>
writing till to-morrow, but he knows<lb/>
his precious wifie will be pleased<lb/>
if he writes a few words, and to<lb/>
gratify his pretty darling, he<lb/>
will gladly continue his letter-<lb/>
I didn't write any, yesterday, my<lb/>
lovie, because I was hard at<lb/>
work all day, &amp; from yesterday's<lb/>
exertion, my bones ache even<lb/>
now. What was I doing? Nothing<lb/>
in a literary line, lovie, but<lb/>
on the purely manual order.<lb/>
You must know, dovie, that my<lb/>
garden was pretty well eaten<lb/>
up by the bugs- the only thing<lb/>
they failed to digest being the<lb/>
Corn. As this latter looked rather<lb/>
enticing in all its freshness<lb/>
&amp; verdancy, it provoked the</p>
