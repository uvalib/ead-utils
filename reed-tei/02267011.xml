<p>SPECIAL ORDERS, }<lb/>
No. 183. }</p>
<p>HEADQUARTERS DIVISION OF CUBA,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Havana, October 17, 1900</hi>.</p>
<p>1. Major <hi rend="italic">James B. Hickey</hi>, Assistant Adjutant General,<lb/>
U. S. Volunteers, will proceed to Puerto Pr&iacute;cipe, Cuba,<lb/>
and make an inspection of the post and troops thereat, and<lb/>
upon completion thereof he will return to his proper<lb/>
station, Havana, Cuba.</p>
<p>The travel enjoined is necessary for the public service.</p>
<p>2. Private <hi rend="italic">William B. Baker</hi>, troop B, 2d Cavalry, hav-<lb/>
ing been tried by a general court-martial convened at<lb/>
Hamilton Barracks, Cuba, and found guilty of desertion,<lb/>
in violation of the 47th Article of War, was sentenced<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">To be dishonorably discharged the service of the United States,<lb/>
forfeiting all pay and allowances due him, and to be confined at<lb/>
hard labor at such place as the reviewing authority may designate<lb/>
for eighteen (18) months</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentence is confirmed to date October 16, 1900, and<lb/>
will be duly executed. Fort Columbus, New York Harbor,<lb/>
is designated as the place of confinement, to which point<lb/>
the prisoner will be sent upon further orders from these<lb/>
Headquarters.</p>
<p>3. The leave of absence for one (1) month granted to<lb/>
Acting Assistant Surgeon <hi><hi rend="italic">A. S. Pinto</hi></hi>, U. S. Army, in<lb/>
Special Orders No. 59, current series, Department of<lb/>
Western Cuba, is hereby extended ten (10) days.</p>
<p>4. Private <hi rend="italic">Raymond B. Heiser</hi>, Troop B, 2d Cavalry,<lb/>
having been tried by a general court-martial convened<lb/>
at Hamilton Barracks, Cuba, and found guilty of desertion,<lb/>
in violation of the 47th Article of War, evidence of one (1)<lb/>
previous conviction having been considered by the court,<lb/>
was sentenced &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">To be dishonorably discharged the service of the<lb/>
United States, forfeiting all pay and allowances due him, and to<lb/>
be confined at hard labor at such place as the reviewing authority<lb/>
may direct for the period of two and one half (21&sol;2) years</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentence is confirmed to date October 16, 1900, and<lb/>
will be duly executed. Fort Columbus, New York Harbor,<lb/>
is designated as the place of confinement, to which point<lb/>
the prisoner will be sent upon further orders from these<lb/>
Headquarters.</p>
<p>5. Private <hi rend="italic">George Lang</hi>, Troop B, 2d Cavalry, having<lb/>
been tried by a general court-martial convened at Hamilton<lb/>
Barracks, Cuba, and found guilty of allowing a prisoner to<lb/>
become drunk, in violation of the 62d Article of War, evi-<lb/>
dence of four (4) previous convictions having been consid-<lb/>
ered by the court, was sentenced &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">To be confined at hard</hi><lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02267012"/>
<hi rend="italic">labor, under charge of the post guard, for two (2) months and to<lb/>
forfeit ten (10) dollars per month for the same period</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the foregoing case of private <hi rend="italic">George Lang</hi>, Troop B,<lb/>
2d Cavalry, the proceedings, findings and sentence are ap-<lb/>
proved. On account of the length of time that the prisoner<lb/>
has been in confinement, so much of the sentence as relates<lb/>
to confinement at hard labor is mitigated to confinement at<lb/>
hard labor under the charge of the post guard for one<lb/>
month. As thus mitigated the sentence is confirmed to<lb/>
date October 16, 1900, and will be duly executed at the<lb/>
post where his troop is stationed.</p>
<p>6. Private <hi rend="italic">James E. Mullen</hi>, battery H, 2d Artillery, hav-<lb/>
ing been tried by a general court-martial convened at Santa<lb/>
Clara Battery, Havana, Cuba, and found guilty of absence<lb/>
without leave, in violation of the 32d Article of War, and<lb/>
conduct to the prejudice of good order and military disci-<lb/>
pline in violation of the 62d Article of War, evidence of<lb/>
four (4) previous convictions having been considered by<lb/>
the court, was sentenced &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">To forfeit ten (10) dollars per month<lb/>
for four (4) months</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentence is confirmed to date October 16, 1900, and<lb/>
will be duly executed. Private <hi rend="italic">Mullen</hi> will be released from<lb/>
confinement and restored to duty with his battery.</p>
<p>BY COMMAND OF MAJOR GENERAL WOOD:</p>
<p>H. L. SCOTT,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Adjutant General</hi>.</p>
