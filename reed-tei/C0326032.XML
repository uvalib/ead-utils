<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am glad to be able to write you that I am leaving for<lb/>
Baltimore early to-morrow morning. Dr. Frost is not yet quite<lb/>
ready to resume consecutive work on the final revision of Father's<lb/>
MS, but, in a telephone conversation last night<unclear>,</unclear> I learned that<lb/>
he will have time this week-end to talk over several things which<lb/>
I feel are of immediate importance (filling in of our long-ready<lb/>
outline maps etc. etc.). I could then try to get all this work<lb/>
started so that everything of the sort would be completed by<lb/>
the time the MS was ready to take to you.</p>
<p>Last night Miss Brown and I made a &ldquo;re-apportionment&rdquo; of<lb/>
material for me to take to Baltimore, I having hoped and expected<lb/>
to move over &ldquo;bag and baggage,&rdquo; including remaining bibliographic<lb/>
files, MSS and book of reference. However, until Dr. Frost is<lb/>
actually ready for this material it had better remain with me, as,<lb/>
although it really is very well worked up, I can think, from time to<lb/>
time, of some way to simplify a card, or may find one useful for a<lb/>
cross-reference.</p>
<p>Miss Brown and I also compiled, last night, a very careful<lb/>
memorandum of things, which it seemed most necessary should be<lb/>
taken up when I went to Baltimore. I already had a much fuller<lb/>
Mem., but I think it will be better to keep to immediate essentials<lb/>
this week-end. For instance, one important thing (very important)<lb/>
is going to be the title of the book. It has always been called<lb/>
The History of Yellow Fever, but, <del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del><add>although</add> the first two <del><unclear>introductory</unclear></del><lb/>
sections, <del><unclear>which</unclear></del> take us to 192<unclear>5</unclear>, the actual historic part of the book<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fc0326033"/>
book<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
stops, as you know, with the epidemics of 1648 in Yucatan and the<lb/>
French Antilles for the Americas and with those reported a little<lb/>
over a hundred years later by Lind and Schotte in Africa. <del><unclear>Dr. Frost</unclear></del><lb/>
It is not then a complete history of yellow fever. This, however, is<lb/>
not a matter of immediate importance (I wish to the Lord it were!) so<lb/>
it is not on to-morrow's list. Of course, when Dr. Frost resumes<lb/>
regular work on the MS (next week I hope) I shall take up everything,<lb/>
which I have jotted down, as things occurred to me, in my more com-<lb/>
plete Memorandum.</p>
<p>Miss Brown and I have been <add>very</add> successful in tracing incomplete<lb/>
references, indeed I've read Las Casas, Oviedo and Herrera until I<lb/>
actually dream in Spanish! Most of this work, since I last wrote you,<lb/>
has been done at the Library of Congress as Herrera is in the Rare<lb/>
Book Room and can only be read there, while the volumes of Oviedo are<lb/>
so large that it would be very hard to transport them. Of course, were<lb/>
it necessary for the work I would do so, but I have had a set of Las<lb/>
Casas at my apartment for night reading: hence something to work on at<lb/>
both ends of the line. All of these three were well worked up last fall,<lb/>
but having had this unexpected (and much regretted!) extra time <del><unclear>before</unclear></del><lb/>
to put in onthe bibliography. I think one might almost call them beauti-<lb/>
fully worked up. For this Miss Brown deserves a lot of the credit.</p>
<p>With very best wishes and I do hope and pray that to-morrow's<lb/>
trip to Baltimore may indeed prove the actual &ldquo;beginning of the end!&rdquo;</p>
