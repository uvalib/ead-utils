<p>Letters to The Outlook</p>
<p>A HERO FROM THE RANKS</p>
<p>Some time ago The Outlook reviewed Mr.<lb/>
H. A. Kelly's &ldquo;Life of Walter Reed,&rdquo; and<lb/>
told of Dr. Reed's remarkable and valuable<lb/>
service in establishing the now universally<lb/>
accepted theory of the transmission of the<lb/>
germs of yellow fever by the mosquito.<lb/>
Below is told the story of a private soldier<lb/>
who risked his life to help in establishing<lb/>
this theory.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1900 Dr. Walter Reed,<lb/>
Chairman of the United States Army Yellow<lb/>
Fever Commission, built an experimental<lb/>
station, called Camp Lazear, near Quemados,<lb/>
Cuba, for the purpose of carrying on experi-<lb/>
ments which should prove or disprove the<lb/>
theory that yellow fever is transmitted by the<lb/>
bite of a certain species of mosquito. He<lb/>
was about to issue a call for volunteers for<lb/>
the purpose, when he was called on by two<lb/>
young privates, John R. Kissinger and John<lb/>
J. Moran, both from Ohio, who told him that<lb/>
they had heard of his wish, and came to<lb/>
offer themselves as subjects for experiment.<lb/>
Dr. Reed explained to them fully the risks<lb/>
involved, and then, finding them determined,<lb/>
he said that a definite money compensation<lb/>
would be made to them. Both young men<lb/>
refused, saying that they volunteered in the<lb/>
service of humanity, and made it their sole<lb/>
stipulation that they should receive no<lb/>
reward. Kissinger was the first subject of<lb/>
experiment in Camp Lazear. On December<lb/>
5, 1900, five infected mosquitoes--that is to<lb/>
say, mosquitoes which had recently (within<lb/>
two weeks) fed upon yellow fever patients--<lb/>
were allowed to bite him, and a little over<lb/>
three days later he was taken ill with the<lb/>
disease. In speaking of the incident after-<lb/>
wards, Dr. Reed said: &ldquo;In my opinion, there<lb/>
has been no higher exhibition of moral cour-<lb/>
age in the annals of the army of the United<lb/>
States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kissinger had a severe attack, and his<lb/>
life was for some time in danger. He re-<lb/>
covered, however, as it was supposed at the<lb/>
time, perfectly, and not long afterwards he<lb/>
left the army, married, and settled down in<lb/>
private life. Within the last year he has<lb/>
been seized with a spinal complaint which<lb/>
has destroyed the use of his lower limbs,<lb/>
and keeps him confined to a wheeled chair.<lb/>
He is now unable to do anything for his own<lb/>
support or that of his wife, and his wife can<lb/>
do nothing which takes her away from home,<lb/>
on account of his necessities. She has,<lb/>
therefore, been supporting them both by<lb/>
washing, in which he was able, until recently,<lb/>
to help her, as he sat propped up in his chair.<lb/>
Now, however, the physician has forbidden<lb/>
him to do so any longer, and he says that<lb/>
he feels the burden on her shoulders more<lb/>
than any other part of his difficulties. He<lb/>
applied some little time ago for a pension,<lb/>
but the sum applied for was cut down from<lb/>
fifty to twelve dollars a month, and even yet<lb/>
hangs fire, because it cannot be shown that<lb/>
his present complaint arose from the yellow<lb/>
fever. It is not likely that he will recover.</p>
<p>The next session of Congress ought to<lb/>
pass a special bill to provide for this man's<lb/>
needs and comfort. Meanwhile, any private<lb/>
contributions to his support might be for-<lb/>
warded through Mr. Howard A. Kelly, 1418<lb/>
Eutaw Place, Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
