<salute>My dear Hutch:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Herewith is the memorandum which I made as a result of my<lb/>
trip. I hope that you can spend a couple of hours reading it. It will give<lb/>
you a good background of knowledge concerning the whole yellow fever business.<lb/>
Some of it, as you see, is confidential. None of it is to be published in this<lb/>
form. I will appreciate knowing your present thoughts on the program. Do<lb/>
you still want me to give an introductory talk on the conquest of yellow fever?<lb/>
If you do, my idea was to have it illustrated with slides and make it as interest-<lb/>
ing and popular as possible. Do you want any of the story published in any W.<lb/>
and J. journal or shall I reserve that for my medical publication later? Should<lb/>
I give the story at W. and J.? There is no purpose in spending any time at all<lb/>
on the story for our search for the camp. So far as your audience is concerned,<lb/>
that is completely unimportant, but sometime I want to talk to you about the<lb/>
possibility that perhaps W. and J. and Columbia, and Johns Hopkins might join<lb/>
together and raise money for a small memorial tablet on the Rojas farm if the<lb/>
Cuban government goes ahead with its plan to build their memorial on the false<lb/>
site. I have collected a number of historical as well as new photographs, some<lb/>
of which I am enclosing. Would it be appropriate to have some of these framed<lb/>
and hung on one of the walls in the Lazear Memorial Building, or would you prefer<lb/>
to have the story written up and the photographs mounted on pages, and have it<lb/>
bound and put in the library as a book?</p>
<p>I find that Dr. Finlay graduated from Jefferson College, Philadelphia,<lb/>
1855. Does that make him in any way related to your college? I have not yet<lb/>
gotten permission from the Department of Agriculture to have the poinciana wood<lb/>
admitted to this country. If they will not let me bring it in, I will try to<lb/>
have a few small objects made in Cuba, if you think that it would be nice to do<lb/>
so. I will get a limb from a tree on the San Jose farm as near the site of the<lb/>
camp as possible. I am trying to find the address of Walter Reed's daughter and<lb/>
of Mrs. Lazear, but have not yet found them. Have you gotten Sawyer as the<lb/>
speaker? Are you planning to invite Kissinger as well as Moran? General Kean<lb/>
of Washington is, of course, as close friend to Walter Reed, and apparently the<lb/>
government's historian of the yellow fever work. He is quite elderly, has a bad<lb/>
stiff knee and a bad heart. Whether he should be invited or whether he would<lb/>
accept, I do not know. Since you are praising Lazear and the American Board, the<lb/>
presence of Finlay's son might be out of place.</p>
<p>May I suggest that you write the following letters to the following<lb/>
people. It would help me much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear So and so: Dr. Jesse Lazear, a member of the U.S. Army Yellow<lb/>
Fever Board, which discovered the cause of yellow fever, was an alumnus of this<lb/>
college. This Fall, we are dedicating a memorial building in his name. At my<lb/>
request, Dr. Philip Hench of the Mayo Clinic has been preparing a story on the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03579003"/>
- 2 -<lb/>
conquest of yellow fever. To re-tell not only the work of Lazear, of course,<lb/>
but that of Dra. Finlay, Reed, Carroll, Agramonte, and all those connected with<lb/>
this brilliant chapter in medical research. Dr. Hench has told me that in<lb/>
connection with his investigations, you have been most helpful, and I wish,<lb/>
as president of Washington and Jefferson College, my personal appreciation for<lb/>
the help that you have already given him, and my hope that you may continue to<lb/>
aid him in the re-telling of this story. We hope that he will be able to publish<lb/>
at least some of his investigations and that we may have them, with photographs<lb/>
of the people and places concerned, filed as a matter of permanent record, in<lb/>
our Lazear Memorial Building.</p>
<p>Very sincerely,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a letter would help greatly, and I think should be sent to the<lb/>
following:<lb/>
<list type="simple">
<item>Mr. John J. Moran, Avenida Menocal 455, Havana, Cuba.</item>
<item>Mr. John R. Kissinger, R. 8, Huntington, Indiana.</item>
<item>Mrs. Estella Agramonte Rodriguez-Leon, 311 Calle 15, Entre H e I,<lb/>
Vedado, Havana.</item>
<item>Senora Maria Teresa Loma viuda de Rojas, 207 Calle 17, Vedado, Havana.</item>
<item>Mr. Luis Pogolotti, Cuba 3, Havana.</item>
<item>Gen. Albert E. Truby, 145 Laurel St., San Francisco.</item>
<item>Gen. J. R. Kean, 2804 N St. N.W., Washington, D. C.<lb/>
Possibly also</item>
<item>Dr. Carlos E. Finlay, 25 No. 1075, Entre 4 c 6, Havana.</item>
<item>Dr. A. Diaz Albertini, Director, Finlay Institute, Havana, Cuba.</item>
</list></p>
<p>You will have received my check for $200.00 to be used in any way<lb/>
you wish. If you want to use it to bring Moran, fine. But as I told you, before<lb/>
I had a chance to tell Moran that the college would pay his expenses, he expressed<lb/>
his appreciation of the invitation and said that he was sure he could get permission<lb/>
from his boss to leave and thought that Mr. Pew might even be willing to pay his<lb/>
expenses. It was his suggestion that you write to Mr. Pew, giving him the chance<lb/>
to do so, with the idea that it would be sort of a nice advertisement for the<lb/>
Sunoco Oil Co., to have its representative in a position of honor. If you do not<lb/>
wish to tap Mr. Pew, use my check. This will cover all of Mr. Moran's expenses<lb/>
including meals and stay in Washington, and might even give a little toward Mrs.<lb/>
Moran's, but it hardly seems that we should have to pay her expenses, too. I think<lb/>
he has enough money to be able to bring her himself.</p>
<p>The following is a letter which is my modification of one suggested by<lb/>
Mr. Moran to be written to Mr. Pew: (Instead of composing one, I am sending you<lb/>
his idea, but obviously it should be modified considerably, as he has made many<lb/>
mistakes in it. I suggest that you modify Moran's last sentence. Perhaps if you<lb/>
leave it out, Pew will offer to pay his way.)</p>
<p>General Reed; sthenson of Major Walter Reed, is living in Washington,<lb/>
retired. I am writing him. I am sure that all he knows is second hand, as he was<lb/>
but a child I believe at the time. If I find that he has some information, I will<lb/>
ask you to write him also. Tell me again the date of the affair. I can't seem to<lb/>
remember it. Let me know your final wishes as to whether you want me to talk and how<lb/>
long.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
