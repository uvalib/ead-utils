<salute>My dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received the cover of the note book three or four days before receiv-<lb/>
ing the letter and was frankly puzzled why you had sent it. I was afraid you<lb/>
had sent it with something else and that the letter had fallen out of the en-<lb/>
velope. I am glad to have it as it will help me know what I am looking for;<lb/>
however, Carroll described a small pocket note book. I certainly hope that<lb/>
some day I will be successful and may be able to see Carroll's journal.</p>
<p>While I was in Washington I loaned Carroll your book. He is a very<lb/>
taciturn fellow and is more inclined not to like something than to like it;<lb/>
nevertheless, he said he liked your book very much although there were a few<lb/>
things he could not agree with. He was not specific enough in the latter.</p>
<p>I am glad that you like the extracts from the Walter Reed letter; I<lb/>
will see if I can find other extracts. As soon as I can have the photographs<lb/>
of the yellow fever huts made I will send you one. I have not heard anything<lb/>
from anyone in Cuba. I don't even know that they have seen your book<del>s</del>. I<lb/>
am about to receive the twenty-five or thirty copies that I ordered in Decem-<lb/>
ber.</p>
<p>I shall be anxious to hear whether you have been able to make contact<lb/>
with Lampson. There are many statements in his book that need <del>carrying out.</del> following up.<lb/>
He had much specific information that no one else seems to have and I suspect<lb/>
that he made it up.</p>
<p>Congratulations on your nice <del>summary.</del><add>recovery.</add> Your hand writing doesn't seem,<lb/>
to me, to be much different from your old hand writing. Be sure to take care<lb/>
of yourself so that that will not happen again.</p>
<p>I think I am going to like it here very much. So far I am not over im-<lb/>
pressed with the town. It irritates me incessantly to see hundreds of people<lb/>
crowding in here for the racing season, to see them lounging around the hotels<lb/>
talking about horses and money while the war is going on. These damn fools<lb/>
don't seem to realize that a war is going on. Why they will allow the racing<lb/>
season to continue here when it has been so difficult for medical men to have<lb/>
medical meetings I do not see. One unhappy result is that we medical officers<lb/>
have to compete for rooms at the very highest prices; no consideration whatever<lb/>
is given to us and it does not give one a feeling of hospitality.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
