Dr. Henry E. Sigrist<lb/>
Johns Hopkins University<lb/>
Institute of the History of Medicine<lb/>
1900 East Monument Street<lb/>
Baltimore, Maryland<lb/>
Dear Dr. Sigrist:</p>
<p>I was thinking of you and your Bulletin the other night when<lb/>
I listened to a lecture given by Dr. Philip Hench who is head of one of<lb/>
the medical sections here at the Clinic. He has been interested for<lb/>
many years in the story of the Reed Yellow Fever Commission and has<lb/>
been collecting documentary material in connection with it for a long<lb/>
time.</p>
<p>Last spring, preparatory to a lecture on the subject, he made<lb/>
a trip to Cuba with the idea of getting some photos and it actually<lb/>
turned into an archeological and historical expedition of the first<lb/>
order. Beginning with his suspicion that some ground that had been set<lb/>
aside for a monument and which was supposed to be the site on which the<lb/>
famous experiments were performed was not the right place, he was able<lb/>
to prove the correctness of his doubts, discovered the actual location<lb/>
with documentary corroboration and purchased the ground himself for a<lb/>
memorial. Not only this, but he came upon the sensational information<lb/>
that the supposed accidental infection by a mosquito bite from which<lb/>
Lazear died was actually an experimental self-inoculation by Lazear,<lb/>
which he concealed because he thought that if <unclear><del>it</del></unclear> were known that he<lb/>
had deliberately infected himself, it would jeopardize his insurance.<lb/>
The whole story as he tells it is a real thriller.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that you would like to have it for your<lb/>
Bulletin. I do not know whether this is within the proprieties, but<lb/>
I might suggest that if you would like to have the article before it<lb/>
is published elsewhere, that you might write to him and invite him to<lb/>
submit it. Otherwise it might be published in the local Mayo Clinic<lb/>
bulletin and thus lose originality for later publication. I think it<lb/>
would be especially appropriate in your Bulletin since Lazear has a<lb/>
particular association with Hopkins.</p>
<p>Best regards to you and your family, and good wishes for a<lb/>
pleasant holiday and a Happy New Year.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<lb/>
Joseph Berkson, M.D.<lb/>
JB:GH</p>
