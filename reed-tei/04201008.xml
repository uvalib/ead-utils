Dr. Otto L. Bettmann, Director,<lb/>
The Bettmann Archive<lb/>
211A East Fifty-Seventh Street<lb/>
New York 22, New York<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Bettmann:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I regret sincerely my delay in returning to you the yellow fever<lb/>
pictures. I laid them aside until such time as I could also send you the<lb/>
photographs of Dr. Will and Charlie Mayo. We had a little trouble locating<lb/>
the old negatives and had to print several of them. I am sending you with<lb/>
the yellow fever paintings a collection of pictures of Dr. Will and Charlie,<lb/>
11 items in all. I could not locate an informal picture of either of them<lb/>
in front of the Clinic. I have many informal pictures but none in front of<lb/>
the Clinic. Three of the pictures are of paintings of Doctor Will and<lb/>
Charlie and most of us like them very much. The one double picture of<lb/>
Doctor Will and Charlie shows representations of their autographs, not<lb/>
actual autographs, but they are very close to the original as they were<lb/>
done by Doctor Will's secretary who had long learned to imitate the signa-<lb/>
ture. The photographic copies of Doctor Will and Charlie in uniform, however,<lb/>
actually show their autographs. The picture of Doctor Will and Charlie with<lb/>
President Roosevelt was taken at a public ceremony, August 8, 1938, when<lb/>
President Roosevelt came to honor Doctor Will and Charlie. It was taken<lb/>
by a newspaper photographer. Keep those which you wish to have and return<lb/>
the rest. I enclose also photographic prints of Dr. William W. Mayo, the<lb/>
father of Doctor Will and Charlie and a copy of a rather rare photograph<lb/>
of the three Mayos (father and two sons) taken early in their career here.</p>
<p>In order to be able to send you these, I had to get permission<lb/>
of certain authorities here as the Clinic is very careful about improper<lb/>
publicity. We understand that you wish to use these in your collection of<lb/>
well-known American doctors. We understand that they will be reproduced<lb/>
from time to time but we are relying on your discretion as to how they are used<lb/>
so that they will be only used in a proper and dignified manner by authorized<lb/>
persons.</p>
<p>It is not necessary, indeed I would suggest that you not pass on to<lb/>
others that you got these from me.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
