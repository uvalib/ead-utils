<p><figure entity="n3136006"></figure> BIRTHPLACE OF WALTER REED.</p>
<p>By DAISY ROWE HEVESSY.</p>
<p>Belroi, Va., Nov. 13.--The<lb/>
humble two-room house here, in<lb/>
which was born the late Walter<lb/>
Reed, U. S. army surgeon, who be-<lb/>
came famous for his discovery of<lb/>
the cause of yellow fever, in which<lb/>
investigation he sacrificed his life,<lb/>
is to become a national shrine. The<lb/>
movement, begun three years ago,<lb/>
to restore the Reed home, has at<lb/>
last been crowned with success. The<lb/>
recent contribution of $1,000 from<lb/>
the Virginia Medical association,<lb/>
and an additional $500 from var-<lb/>
ious groups, have made possible<lb/>
the transfer of the title to the old<lb/>
house and garden plot to the Wal-<lb/>
ter Reed Medical society which be-<lb/>
gan the movement. This organiza-<lb/>
tion will take in hand the work of<lb/>
restoring the old house and see<lb/>
that it is maintained as a shrine.</p>
<p>Already the deed has been pre-<lb/>
pared transferring cottage and<lb/>
tract of land 100 by 220 feet from<lb/>
its present owner, George D. Stubbs,<lb/>
upon whose farm the old Reed<lb/>
house has been used as tenant prop-<lb/>
erty, to the Walter Reed Medical<lb/>
society. This society is composed<lb/>
of members scattered throughout<lb/>
the United States who have been<lb/>
cooperating with the Walter Reed<lb/>
Memorial farm of the University of<lb/>
Virginia.</p>
<p>Sufficient contributions covering<lb/>
the purchase price are now in hand.<lb/>
Future donations will be applied<lb/>
to maintaining the property, which<lb/>
is in Gloucester county, as a fitting<lb/>
memorial to the famous surgeon.</p>
<p>Familiar to Motorists.</p>
<p>Familiar to motorists, this tiny<lb/>
cottage near the Tidewater High-<lb/>
way is about 160 miles from Wash-<lb/>
ington, D. C. Before the door<lb/>
stands the pink crepe myrtle tree,<lb/>
planted years ago by the Rev. Lem-<lb/>
uel Sutton Reed at the time he<lb/>
served as pastor of Bellymus M.<lb/>
E. church in Gloucester county.<lb/>
Here in the old-time parsonage of<lb/>
the circuit, Walter, his youngest<lb/>
son, was born September 13, 1851.<lb/>
Later the family moved to Harri-<lb/>
sonburg, Va., where the children<lb/>
of the preeacher received the best<lb/>
schooling to be had under private<lb/>
instruction at that time.</p>
<p>Later Walter Reed, in 1867, at-<lb/>
tended two sessions at the Univer-<lb/>
sity of Virginia, where he studied<lb/>
Latin, Greek, English literature<lb/>
and mathematics. In 1868 he<lb/>
studied medicine, and at the end<lb/>
of the session was graduated after<lb/>
one year's work, giving evidence<lb/>
that he was an exceptional student.<lb/>
Following his graduation he went<lb/>
to New York, and matriculated at<lb/>
Bellevue Hospital Medical school.<lb/>
A year later Walter Reed received<lb/>
his M. D. degree. From Harvard<lb/>
university he won his A. M. degree,<lb/>
and the University of Michigan<lb/>
later conferred upon him the LL. D.<lb/>
degree. In 1893 he attended Johns<lb/>
Hopkins university.</p>
<p>Worked Hard at Research.</p>
<p>From the time he was appointed<lb/>
assistant surgeon in the army with<lb/>
the rank of captain, on January<lb/>
26, 1880, and subsequently surgeon,<lb/>
with the rank of major, on Decem-<lb/>
ber 4, 1893, to the time of his<lb/>
death, on November 22, 1902, he<lb/>
worked indefatigably in the field of<lb/>
medical and bacteriological re-<lb/>
search.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed's heroic experiments<lb/>
while serving in the United States<lb/>
army in Cuba to rid the island<lb/>
of yellow fever are the outstanding<lb/>
accomplishment of his life. He be-<lb/>
lieved the mosquito was the trans-<lb/>
mitter of the plague and to this<lb/>
theory he clung tenaciously in his<lb/>
determination to locate the guilty<lb/>
agent. He found that no less than<lb/>
700 separate species of tropical<lb/>
mosquitoes exist.</p>
<p>After several years Walter<lb/>
Reed's experiments were no longer<lb/>
a mere theory, but were crowned<lb/>
with success in ridding humanity of<lb/>
the deadliest of diseases. Upon the<lb/>
female stegomyia he placed and<lb/>
proved responsibility for the havoc<lb/>
wrought upon human lives.</p>
<p>Problem Became National One.</p>
<p>In 1898, when Dr. Gorgas be-<lb/>
came chief sanitary officer for Cuba<lb/>
the problem of ridding the terri-<lb/>
tory of yellow fever became a na-<lb/>
tional one. Centuries of Spanish<lb/>
generations on this island knew no<lb/>
hope or relief from the peril.</p>
<p>One outstanding man of those<lb/>
years was Joseph L. Le Prince,<lb/>
engineer, who was of great assist-<lb/>
ance in making Havana sanitary.<lb/>
The United States appointed the<lb/>
yellow fever commission composed<lb/>
of Walter Reed, James Carroll,<lb/>
Jesse W. Legear and Aristides Ag-<lb/>
ramonte. Names which now stand<lb/>
high in scientific research and<lb/>
heroism.</p>
<p>Dr. James Carroll permitted<lb/>
himself to be bitten by an infected<lb/>
stegomyia mosquito. He fell ill and<lb/>
narrowly escaped death. He died<lb/>
of a heart affection in 1907. Dr.<lb/>
Legear died September 28, 1900.<lb/>
A tablet to his memory at Johns<lb/>
Hopkins hospital reads:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With more than courage and<lb/>
devotion of the soldier he risked<lb/>
and lost his life to show how a<lb/>
fearful pestilence is communicated<lb/>
and how its ravages may be pre-<lb/>
vented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lauded by Gen. Wood.</p>
<p>But the memory of Maj. Walter<lb/>
Reed, who learned the cause and<lb/>
concerned himself with the control<lb/>
of yellow fever is one which<lb/>
&ldquo;makes him great in the eyes of<lb/>
science and greater in his service<lb/>
to his fellow men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gen. Leonard Wood, reflecting<lb/>
on Reed's great achievement, said:<lb/>
&ldquo;I know of no man who has done<lb/>
so much for humanity as Maj.<lb/>
Reed. His discovery has resulted<lb/>
in the saving of more lives annually<lb/>
than were lost in the Cuban war,<lb/>
and the saving for commercial in-<lb/>
terests of the world of a sum<lb/>
greater than the entire cost of the<lb/>
Cuban war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Walter Reed Memorial hos-<lb/>
pital, occupying sixteen city blocks<lb/>
at Washington, D. C., is the gift of<lb/>
the Federal government and offers<lb/>
specialized training to army offi-<lb/>
cers besides caring for enlisted men<lb/>
--a great tribute to the memory of<lb/>
Reed.</p>
<p>The purchase of the humble<lb/>
home in which Walter Reed was<lb/>
born in this quiet corner of Vir-<lb/>
ginia and its use as a shrine has<lb/>
stirred the admiration and brought<lb/>
support from medical men through-<lb/>
out the world.</p>
