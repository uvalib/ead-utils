Senior Sanitary Engineer J. A. LePrince,<lb/>
U. S. Public Health Service,<lb/>

Memphis, Tenn.<lb/>
<salute>Dear LePrince:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You and Tarbett--an excellent man, by the way--are clearly work-<lb/>
ing to check up statement of the Commission of the Pasteur Institute<lb/>
(Marchoux: Simond and Sal<unclear></unclear>mbini) working at Rio, 1903-'05, that while<lb/>
newly hatched Stegomyia bit in the day time, those of an age at which<lb/>
they could be infective to men bit only at night. This statement, as<lb/>
you know, was based upon the reported safety of people susceptible to<lb/>
yellow fever in Rio in the day time and was supported by some observa-<lb/>
tions they made on day and night biting of Stegomyia. The opinion had<lb/>
been very generally held in the past, however, that yellow fever was<lb/>
contracted only at night; as the above Committee formulated it: &ldquo;It<lb/>
(or &ldquo;It maybe said&rdquo; I forget the exact language<lb/>
is probable that this disease is never contracted while the sun is<lb/>
above the horizon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have given this matter considerable thought and gotten some<lb/>
data thereon: Here is some of the latter:</p>
<p>1/ Howard: Dyar and Knab analyze the observations made by the<lb/>
Pasteur Commission and claim--I think rightly--that they do not jus-<lb/>
tify the conclusions the Commission drew from them.</p>
<p>2/ Seidelin (in Yucatan) made some direct experiments with Ste-<lb/>
gomyia <del>from</del> 15 days old <add>&amp; older</add> that bit freely in the day time. The condi-<lb/>
tions approached the natural, but the experiments were not extensive.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01221003"/>
<p>extensive.</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>3/ Gordon and at Manaos, in 19 made experiments,<lb/>
apparently very careful, well controlled and under natural conditions,<lb/>
and they found that of the same bunch of mosquitoes double the number<lb/>
of bites were recorded during one hour (from 12-1 or from 1-2) in day<lb/>
<del>light</del> as were recorded during one hour (8-9 or from 9-10) at night.<lb/>
These experiments, I think, may be held convincing.</p>
<p>4/ I reported 22 cases of yellow fever contracted during day light<lb/>
(between 8 A. M. and 5 P. M.) in the Executive Building in Panama in<lb/>
1905. Two night watchman, at least, (and doubtless they had visitors)<lb/>
being in the building at night to furnish food if the mosquitoes pre-<lb/>
ferred to bite at that time.</p>
<p>The above seem to me to <hi>prove</hi> that infective Stegomyia feed in the<lb/>
day so as to be of sanitary importance. In addition I would say that<lb/>
I have never known of a single instance of a town or a village in the<lb/>
U. S. which allowed &ldquo;day light communication&rdquo; with an infected place es-<lb/>
caping the infection of yellow fever. It is true that it was very gen-<lb/>
erally explained by someone bringing back a handkerchief or something<lb/>
of that sort from the infected town. Similarly, following the teaching<lb/>
of Sir James Lind, (about 1791, and based on his experience with malaria<lb/>
on the West African Coast) our Navy for many years allowed day light<lb/>
communication with infected ports in the West Indies (St. Thomas es-<lb/>
pecially). It was rare, however, that they escaped infection, very usu-<lb/>
ally ascribed, however, to the eating of pineapples ashore. These last<lb/>
two, of course, are without the scientific accuracy of the others, but<lb/>
are just as true.</p>
<p>I am very glad that you have taken it up and <add>I</add> am giving Tarbett's<lb/>
paper to Dr. Beeuwkes, going in charge of the Rockefeller work to West<lb/>
Africa, especially because I see a 1/2 or maybe 1/4 belief in this ex-<lb/>
ploded theory show out of all the English reports from that country, and<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01221004"/>
and<lb/>
-3-<lb/>
more from those of the French.</p>
<p>I would like to say here that this Pasteur Commission, above re-<lb/>
ferred to, made more erroneous deductions from insufficient data than<lb/>
ever did old Rush, who held that yellow fever was practically the same<lb/>
as a marsh miasm, differing only from being due to animal instead of<lb/>
vegetable decomposition, yet its conclusions are very generally accepted<lb/>
as inspired by the Latins all over the world and this in spite of the<lb/>
great French epidemiologists of the last Century--the greatest we have<lb/>
ever had to study that disease, whose teaching their own countrymen ap-<lb/>
parently have forgotten.</p>
<p>I will be very glad to consult with you, personally, if you come<lb/>
to Washington, by writing if you do not, to devise experiments at once<lb/>
feasible and convincing to check up the question of proportional night<lb/>
and day feeding under natural conditions of Stegomyia over 14 days old,<lb/>
together with the conditions which may influence it. I had never thought<lb/>
of your time of the emergence of the insect by night or by day as affect-<lb/>
ing the time of feeding, yet it might.</p>
<p>I have written an Epidemiology of Yellow Fever, in which there is,<lb/>
naturally, some study of Stegomyia biology. It has been mimeographed<lb/>
by the I. H. B. and sent out to all their field workers. A few insti-<lb/>
tutions (The Hopkins School of Hygiene: Harvard etc.) have secured copies.<lb/>
I presume you could get a copy for yourself through Ferrell, if not, I<lb/>
can let you see mine, though I had rather hand it to you than send it.</p>
<p>Frankly, I count the question as settled as to the day feeding of<lb/>
infective Stegomyia mosquitoes, but since you state that the Mexican<lb/>
quarantine is based upon the contrary and I had to fight it off in Peru:<lb/>
and Ecuador, further observations are justified, <hi>if they can be made<lb/>
without interfering with other things.</hi></p>
<p>Probably <add>enough</add> Beeuwkes will have to have independent observation made<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01221005"/>
made<lb/>
-4-<lb/>
upon this matter in West Africa, because there is, as you know, some-<lb/>
times a regional difference in the biology of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>With best remembrances to yourself and any others of the malaria<lb/>
men whom you happen to see, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
