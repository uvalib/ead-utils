Mr. Louis Pogolotti<lb/>
Cuba 3<lb/>
Habana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Pogolotti:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am sorry indeed to hear that you never received two of my letters, and<lb/>
particularly that the letter with all the photographs was lost. I must have sent<lb/>
you twenty or so small photographs. I will get out the films within the next few<lb/>
days and have another set printed for you. It gives me great pleasure to do this,<lb/>
and I regret that you must have thought me very ungrateful for not writing you<lb/>
sooner. I certainly did appreciate the wonderful you gave to me, and in due time<lb/>
will send you my written report.</p>
<p>As I told you while in Havana, the last six or eight weeks were completely<lb/>
filled with work, and only now am I able to get at the yellow fever work. I<lb/>
visited a friend of Mr. Moran's, General Kean, in Washington and found out some<lb/>
other information. Also at the Army Medical Museum, I found an old picture of<lb/>
Camp Columbia with the railroad track and a small bridge across it at the site<lb/>
of the false camp. On this site was a tent hospital where the volunteers who got<lb/>
yellow fever at Camp Lazear on the San Jose farm were taken. That is the reason<lb/>
that the confusion arose.</p>
<p>I really wish sometime that you would think seriously of coming up here, not<lb/>
only to come to the Clinic, but if you ever come to America, I wish that you would<lb/>
visit Rochester and be our house guest while going through the Clinic. I don't<lb/>
believe the cold weather would worry you too much, certainly not if you came at<lb/>
any time during the Summer, as it is as hot as the hinges of Hades here.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried taking the small capsules of ephedrin? You can get<lb/>
this at any drug store, and I would suggest that you get the 25 mg. capsules.<lb/>
You might try taking one or two every several hours, to see if this helps your<lb/>
asthma.</p>
<p>I shall be delighted to hear from you at any time, and you will be hearing<lb/>
again from me shortly.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>

<seg>
P.S. I sent the other letters addressed to you at Calle Cuba #3, Havana.<lb/>
