My dear Doctor Carter:</p>
<p>Mr. E.H. Thompson, Archeologist, has just left me after<lb/>
a pleasant half hour discussion on the probable use of the "Chultunes<lb/>
by the ancient Mayas. You will recall that Spinden in his article in<lb/>
the Worlds Work (December 1921) states that the &ldquo;Chultuns&rdquo; were for<lb/>
express purpose of conserving fresh water.</p>
<p>Spinden's statement has been questioned by other Archeolo-<lb/>
gists who claim that the &ldquo;Chultuns&rdquo; were constructed for the purpose<lb/>
of storing corn. Another link in determining the presence of yellow<lb/>
fever amongst the Mayas would be forged if it can be proven that the<lb/>
&ldquo;Chultunes&rdquo; were used for storing fresh water as these ancient<lb/>
peoples would have unwittingly provided ideal breeding places for<lb/>
the only known vector of the causative agent of yellow fever.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind I sought out Mr. Thompson, a well<lb/>
known student of Maya history and he tells me that the &ldquo;Chultunes&rdquo;<lb/>
were in his <unclear>opinion</unclear> used exclusively for conserving water for do-<lb/>
mestic use. He refers me to his article<del>s</del> The Chultunes of Labna.<lb/>
published by the Peabody Musuem, Harvard University, Cambridge Mass,<lb/>
from which Institution copies of his article can be secured for the<lb/>
asking. I am asking Miss Miller to request a copy for my files.</p>
<p>You have undoubtedly seen Dr. White and he has related<lb/>
to you the factors relative to the outbreak of yellow fever in<lb/>
Panuco and Tampico. He told me that the infection was probably en-<lb/>
demic in Tampico, and had existed in a mild form for the eighteen mon<lb/>
-ths, amongst the children, when<del>h</del> we thought it had been eliminated<lb/>
It seemed to be when I was last in Tampico that the infection was<lb/>
not endemic in the city but in the region or area and we never found<lb/>
it out until it had reached epidemic proportions.</p>
<p>One error in the Mexican campaign has been the failure<lb/>
<unclear>to</unclear> make a csreful epidemiologocal survey and study of vital statis-<lb/>
tics in the begining of the campaign. Doctor White started on this<lb/>
detail as soon as possible after taking hold of the work and the<lb/>
data collected will be very valuable for future guidance.</p>
<p>The Mexican problem is quite different in many rep-ects<lb/>
from Panama or Guayaquil, in the former places there was only one<lb/>
center in each country to treat while here there are several and<lb/>
in Mexico the intercommunications are so complete that no part of<lb/>
the stegomyia infested area can be left untreated unless we are<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01003003"/>
-2-<lb/>
prepared to remain here several years treating the key centers and allowing the in-<lb/>
fection to die out in the smaller towns, or we might use your plan of &ldquo;sweeping<lb/>
the country&rdquo; as carried out by Hanson in Peru, (am I right in this) and get results<lb/>
within the year.</p>
<p>The unstable conditions in Mexico <add>is</add> causing me to think that we should work as fast as<lb/>
we can because if revolution ovotakes us our work will have to stop, as it is out<lb/>
question to place dependence upon the local men. Tampcio proves this to me. We turned<lb/>
the city over with a low stegomyia index and six weeks later Drs. White and Scannell<lb/>
found over %60% house index in certain areas.</p>
<p>Doctor Scannell has been placed in charge in tthe Tampico area and Doctor Cuaron writes<lb/>
me that the organization has been so well developed and the index is coming down<lb/>
that in a short time they expect the situation to be dominated.</p>
<p>I may remain in Mexico longer than planned, so if there is any further data that you may<lb/>
need from Dr. Martinez or Mr. Thompson write me and I will gladly try and secure<lb/>
same. I saw Dr. Martinez a few days ago and he again told me that you and one other<lb/>
man were the only people who had ever thanked <unclear>him</unclear> for his services.</p>
<p>From all the data, statistics and conference with the physicians throughout the State<lb/>
it would seem that we are free of the infection here.<lb/>
Unless a change for the better takes place within a year or two Yucatan will be will<lb/>
be well advanced into a decadent commercial period and then, even if yellow fever comes<lb/>
back it will not be the factor that <add>it</add> once was. But on account of nearly 1200 aljibes,<lb/>
well grouped, would remain longer than it <del>did</del> probably did in Campeche and Tabasco.</p>
<p>Miss Read forwarded me a copy of your comments on the &ldquo;Notes&rdquo;. The "critical<lb/>
period was a verbal inadvertance and I have requested Miss Read to make it read in the<lb/>
original &ldquo;critical number period&rdquo;. I do greatly appreciate you giving your time to go<lb/>
over these articles and <add>the</add> criticism <unclear>in</unclear> helpful to me.</p>
<p>With all good wishes to you and yours,</p>
<p>estoy como siempre, su amigo.</p>
<p><unclear>M E Connor</unclear></p>
