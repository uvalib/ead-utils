<salute>My sweet, little E.;</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is <del>just</del><add>already</add><lb/>
3 o'clock P.M., &amp; my letter is<lb/>
just begun- Do you ask for<lb/>
the cause of the delay? I know<lb/>
the fact of my delaying will<lb/>
only tend to confirm your be-<lb/>
lief that I have grown wea-<lb/>
ry of writing twice a week-<lb/>
Now, really, my precious, you<lb/>
were only joking when you<lb/>
wrote that in your last<lb/>
letter- I <hi>know</hi> you were, &amp;<lb/>
yet it gives me an op-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01661002"/>
portunity of telling you from<lb/>
the bottom of my heart that I<lb/>
enjoy our correspondence as<lb/>
much (&amp; more) <del>than</del> <add>than</add> <del>as</del> I did<lb/>
when it was first begun-<lb/>
and I look for the arrival<lb/>
of your darling letters much<lb/>
more eagerly- <hi>Then</hi>, there were<lb/>
many perplexing doubts that<lb/>
sore troubled me; but <hi>now</hi>,<lb/>
you<del>r</del> are my own, darling<lb/>
little Emilie- the sweetest<lb/>
woman, in my estimation, that<lb/>
ever breathed! And don't think<lb/>
that because you have given<lb/>
your heart to me, that I, like<lb/>
many, ah! too many! have<lb/>
grown indifferent, Believe<lb/>
me, my love, it is not so!<lb/>
On the other hand, when I<lb/>
come to see you &amp; find<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01661003"/>
myself in the dear little par-<lb/>
lor, awaiting your appear-<lb/>
ance, there is a tumultu-<lb/>
ous beating in my bosom<lb/>
that is unmistak<del>e</del>able- and<lb/>
it is <add>in</add> vain that I try to pre-<lb/>
serve a calm exterior.</p>
<p>Well, if all this be true, doubt-<lb/>
less, you wonder why I<lb/>
didn't write my letter, this<lb/>
morning- It was simply be-<lb/>
cause I had some matters<lb/>
to attend to, at the <hi>Hospl</hi> that<lb/>
could not be delayed- A<lb/>
large invoice of Medical<lb/>
Stores had arrived &amp; I had<lb/>
to superintend the unpack-<lb/>
ing of the same, &amp; see that<lb/>
none were missing- This<lb/>
work I have just finished,<lb/>
&amp; without a moment's de-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01661004"/>
lay, I have taken up my pen.<lb/>
Now, am I not a very dutiful<lb/>
boy, after all? Do say yes,<lb/>
my darling, or I shall be ev-<lb/>
er so much downhearted!<lb/>
I can't labor, with a light<lb/>
heart, while you, my Queen,<lb/>
art frowning- Just deign<lb/>
to spare one smile (oh! that<lb/>
I could see it!) while you<lb/>
read, &amp; I shall be happy!<lb/>
Tell Miss Annie, that we can<lb/>
never be friends till she re-<lb/>
tracts her remark concerning you,<lb/>
&amp; acknowledges that you are<lb/>
the greatest woman living;<lb/>
&amp; that you neither put on airs<lb/>
nor toss your head! How<lb/>
blind she must be, not<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01661005"/>
to see that you are an<lb/>
Angel! To my mind, nothing<lb/>
could be clearer, and I have<lb/>
no doubt that she would<lb/>
agree with me, only she does<lb/>
not like to acknowledge it<lb/>
<hi>to me</hi>! When I next see<lb/>
her, we will discuss the<lb/>
matter. Just as I finished<lb/>
the above sentence, I heard<lb/>
several loud reports, &amp;<lb/>
on going to the window, I<lb/>
find that a salute of<lb/>
13 Cannon are being fired<lb/>
in honor of the arrival<lb/>
of General Humphreys, who<lb/>
is Chief of the Engineers<lb/>
of the Army- The Point has<lb/>
been in a quiver of ex-<lb/>
pectation, since the report<lb/>
that he was coming reached</p>
<pb n="6" id="f01661007"/>
<p>here, a few days ago- To-mor-<lb/>
row, there will be a grand<lb/>
parade &amp; review, but I shan't<lb/>
attend, as I must meet<lb/>
Jimmie, in New York to-mor-<lb/>
row morning- we have all<lb/>
been invited by General Ab-<lb/>
bott to his house, this evening<lb/>
to meet the Chief &amp; grasp his<lb/>
powerful hand. Of course,<lb/>
I <del>shall</del> shall go &amp; make<lb/>
my obeisance, for you must<lb/>
know that an invitation from<lb/>
the Commanding Officer is<lb/>
equal to a <hi>command</hi>, &amp; is not<lb/>
to be overlooked- Tomorrow<lb/>
evening, the officers' mess<lb/>
will give the Chief a ban-<lb/>
quet, &amp; I expect to destroy<lb/>
more than my usual amt.<lb/>
of food- whether I shall</p>

<pb n="8" id="f01661008"/>
<p>silver locks &amp; a pleasant<lb/>
smile- After a conversation<lb/>
of a few moments, the<lb/>
large folding-doors were<lb/>
thrown open, &amp; we were<lb/>
invited to join in an ele-<lb/>
gant repast- This over, we<lb/>
returned to the Parlor, &amp; chatted<lb/>
a few moments, &amp; then bade<lb/>
the old warrior good eve-<lb/>
ning- As it is quite late,<lb/>
I will terminate my epistle,<lb/>
&amp; retire, so that I may rise early<lb/>
in the morning &amp; go to the City-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Good-night, my darling,<lb/>
and believe me, as ever,<lb/>
your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
