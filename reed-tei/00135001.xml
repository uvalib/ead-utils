<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>To-day I took a<lb/>
very interesting walk with Norris<lb/>
over the Pentland Hills. We started<lb/>
at 10 o'clock this morning and got<lb/>
back in time for dinner at 6</p>
<p>Wednesday June 18</p>
<p>I was too tired on Sunday night to finish<lb/>
my letter, and since then I have not<lb/>
had time I received your two letters<lb/>
on Monday with the enclosed letter from<lb/>
Aunt Kate. I hope you did go to<lb/>
Bedford. I have no doubt it would<lb/>
do you good. I had hoped that your<lb/>
stomach would be better when you got<lb/>
proper food. You will have to go to<lb/>
Bedford and get yourself toned up and<lb/>
then we, will be careful next year<lb/>
to go where we can have well cooked<lb/>
food.</p>
<p>The walk I took on Sunday was<lb/>
very pleasant, We walked clear<lb/>
across the Pentland Hills most of<lb/>
the way along a path. They are<lb/>
great rugged mountains covered with<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00135002"/>
<unclear>heathings</unclear></p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon I went<lb/>
to the top of Nelson's Monument on<lb/>
<unclear>Calton</unclear> Hill. There is a very<lb/>
good view from the top. The city can<lb/>
be well seen but otherwise the<lb/>
view is simply a part of what can<lb/>
be better seen from Arthur's Seat,<lb/>
I went to the Exhibition on<lb/>
Saturday night. The Edinburgh<lb/>
people think a great deal of this<lb/>
exhibition, and it really has some<lb/>
very good exhibits but exhibitions<lb/>
are always <unclear>tiresome</unclear> on the whole</p>
<p>Dr. Billing has been here<lb/>
for the last few days. He called<lb/>
at the Dissecting room to see<lb/>
me but I was not there at the<lb/>
time. He also sent his card<lb/>
and I called yesterday not finding<lb/>
him at home however. He <del>was</del><lb/>
is visiting one of the professors<lb/>
at the University. They all think<lb/>
a great deal of him. He leaves<lb/>
this morning.</p>
<p>While on last Sunday's tramp we<lb/>
took a little <unclear>while</unclear> out of our<lb/>
course to see Lennox Castle.<lb/>
There is nothing left but out corner<lb/>
of the tower covered with ivy.<lb/>
It was the residence of the Earl of Lennox<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00135003"/>
and was occupied for some time by<lb/>
Mary Queen of Scots. I send an ivy<lb/>
leaf from a vine growing on the walls.<lb/>
I do not take much stock in gathering<lb/>
mementos and such, and I will<lb/>
not often bore you by sending dried<lb/>
weeds.</p>
<p>Another Castle in this vicinity which<lb/>
I will have to visit in Craigmillar.<lb/>
This was also a residence of Mary<lb/>
Stuart. After seeing these two I<lb/>
<del>shall</del> think I shall have done<lb/>
my duty in the matter of Ruins.</p>
<p>I suppose I ought to look at the<lb/>
interior of Holyrood, but if it is no<lb/>
better than the exterior. I shall not<lb/>
waste much time on it.</p>
<p>A sight which I must see, is the<lb/>
new Forth Bridge. It is said to<lb/>
be a magnificent structure. I could<lb/>
see one cantilever of it from<lb/>
Arthur's Seat.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
