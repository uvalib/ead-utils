<hi>No. 26,</hi><lb/>
<hi>Sunday forenoon</hi>.<lb/>
<salute>My precious wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have<lb/>
a little time at my dispos-<lb/>
al to write a few lines to<lb/>
my darling girls- I have<lb/>
had callers all the morning<lb/>
&amp; am expecting Darboy<lb/>
to come out &amp; spend the<lb/>
day with me- So that, if<lb/>
I don't write now, I won't<lb/>
get any chance till to-night.<lb/>
My! but I had good luck<lb/>
yesterday- <hi>Three</hi> letters<lb/>
from the fairest of the fair,<lb/>
one dated July 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>; another<lb/>
22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>, &amp; still a third July 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02071002"/>
The one of the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, I should<lb/>
have had last Wednesday-<lb/>
But it just missed the boat<lb/>
&amp; so was delayed in its ar-<lb/>
rival until Saturday-<lb/>
And such sweet, interest-<lb/>
ing and cheerful letters they<lb/>
were! I could have told,<lb/>
after the first few lines,<lb/>
that it had rained at<lb/>
Keewaydin and that the weather<lb/>
was cooler! What a relief<lb/>
it must have been to<lb/>
my precious children and to<lb/>
dear Aunt Jane to be rid<lb/>
of such abominably unen-<lb/>
durable weather! And all<lb/>
the time we in Cuba were<lb/>
enjoying the cooling showers<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02071003"/>
and sea-breezes! Now, I<lb/>
must stop to read again your<lb/>
dear letter of the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- Well,<lb/>
<hi>if</hi> the <hi>weather</hi> was <hi>so hot</hi> that<lb/>
Miss Meadows &amp; Miss Motts<lb/>
<hi>passed the julep by</hi>, all I've<lb/>
got to say is that it <hi>must</hi><lb/>
have been <hi>very warm</hi> in those<lb/>
parts! I am so glad that<lb/>
<add>you</add> put the boughs over the little<lb/>
maples and that they are still<lb/>
alive &amp; growing -- of course,<lb/>
it must have been very<lb/>
trying to the Evergreens-<lb/>
I should not have been<lb/>
surprised to hear that they<lb/>
had all succumbed- Never<lb/>
mind about the strawberries-<lb/>
I am afraid that runners<lb/>
made in such hot weather<lb/>
wouldn't make good plants.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02071004"/>
We can buy better ones<lb/>
very cheap -- enough to en-<lb/>
tirely fill the whole bed,<lb/>
so that next season my<lb/>
sweet babies can just<lb/>
revel in the luscious fruit!<lb/>
I told you, Miss Farmer-lady,<lb/>
that the grass was safe-<lb/>
Kentucky blue is very te-<lb/>
nacious of existence and<lb/>
hard to kill after one good<lb/>
season. Won't you enjoy<lb/>
the blackberries now? That<lb/>
soaking rain will be<lb/>
just what they need- My!<lb/>
if they could only last till<lb/>
august 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>! I should<lb/>
just like to taste one or two-<lb/>
But the <hi>peaches</hi> won't be<lb/>
gone! That is something<lb/>
delightful to look forward to!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02071005"/>
Here I had to stop my letter<lb/>
for a while- Dear Darboy<lb/>
Came out soon after and took<lb/>
dinner with us- I enjoyed<lb/>
his visit very much- He looks<lb/>
well &amp; hearty, but not as<lb/>
fleshy as when you saw<lb/>
him last- He expects his<lb/>
appointment any day,<lb/>
&amp; hopes that he can get it<lb/>
by the time my transport<lb/>
leaves- I heard this afternoon<lb/>
that the Rawlins would<lb/>
sail august 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>, <del>Wednes</del> <add>(Thursday)</add><lb/>
but this is not positive-<lb/>
I hope that she will leave<lb/>
by Wednesday the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. I<lb/>
read your letters to Darboy<lb/>
&amp; he enjoyed them very much,<lb/>
He sends much love to Mother &amp; Sister<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02071006"/>
<hi>Monday Morning, 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> July</hi>- Good<lb/>
morning, Miss Fatty, how are<lb/>
you this beautiful, cool Cuban<lb/>
morning? Still asleep? Oh!<lb/>
Get up and pick some of those<lb/>
delicious <del>rasp</del> black berries<lb/>
for your breakfast! But<lb/>
don't get any of those &ldquo;big<lb/>
yellow fat bugs&rdquo; mixed up<lb/>
with them! He! He! Your<lb/>
precious letter of July 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi><lb/>
was so interesting- It did<lb/>
me <hi>good</hi> to hear of the way<lb/>
things were beginning to grow<lb/>
at dear Keewaydin- I could<lb/>
see you and dear Aunt Jane<lb/>
sitting up on the top stone<lb/>
wall of the garden, while You<lb/>
read about the delightful sum-<lb/>
mer climate of Cuba! I <hi>must</hi><lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02071007"/>
hurry up &amp; come so as to see<lb/>
those pretty poppies- Don't<lb/>
let them all bloom before I<lb/>
get there- I think your sug-<lb/>
gestion as to the clematis<lb/>
at the end of the arbor<lb/>
will be too pretty- That<lb/>
<hi>drawing</hi> was <hi>immense</hi><lb/>
lovie, dear! So you and Auntie<lb/>
and aunt Annie think that the ter-<lb/>
raced garden is a success-<lb/>
I thought that <del>that</del> it would<lb/>
please the artistic eye<lb/>
as soon as the vegetables<lb/>
got to growing well- You<lb/>
must send auntie some veg-<lb/>
etables, when you have them<lb/>
to spare. Hurr<del>h</del>ah! for that<lb/>
road that Johnnie Moore<lb/>
built! So it's smooth and<lb/>
hard is it? Well when Johnnie<lb/>
Moore tackles a road, or any<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02071008"/>
thing else, its pretty apt to be<lb/>
well done! Give him my kindest<lb/>
regards- He must get the mason<lb/>
of whom he spoke to build the<lb/>
pillars when he gets there- <hi>of<lb/>
course</hi> that summer-house must<lb/>
be of <hi>Stone</hi>! Didn't I tell you<lb/>
so, you sweet, fat stone-tosser!<lb/>
<hi>Johnnie Moore will build it!</hi><lb/>
Talk to him about it! Don't tell<lb/>
me any more about &ldquo;Carrie <hi>freez-<lb/>
ing</hi> ice-Cream&rdquo;! I don't want<lb/>
to hear about it! So the nice<lb/>
young bean caught you napping?<lb/>
Well, <hi>that was a pickle</hi>!! and<lb/>
the two young ladies trying to<lb/>
straighten out their back hair!<lb/>
<hi>of course</hi> we must build a house.<lb/>
Didn't I tell you so? Save the<lb/>
money? Aren't we doing that<lb/>
very thing, you precious mink?<lb/>
Put some chickens in that pan<lb/>
&amp; begin to fatten them for me!<lb/>
Don't forget the <hi>cabbages</hi>- Boo! Boo!<lb/>
Love to aunt Jane &amp; Helen- Kisses &amp; love<lb/>
for my precious girls-</p>
