Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn-<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> gave me<lb/>
great pleasure- I should be greatly<lb/>
pleased to meet you wherever you<lb/>
may come to Washington and to talk<lb/>
over with you the details of the dra-<lb/>
matic episode of Walter Reed and<lb/>
the conquest of Yellow Fever-</p>
<p>Reed and I were good friends before<lb/>
the Yellow Fever Board came to Cuba<lb/>
in June 1900 and he located himself<lb/>
at Marianao, 8 miles S. W. of Havana,<lb/>
largely I think because it was<lb/>
the Hdqrs of the Dept. of Havana <add>Province</add> and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06282023"/>
Ac<lb/>
<unclear>K</unclear><lb/>
2<lb/>
Penar del Rio and I was the Chief<lb/>
Surgeon of that Dept. and so would<lb/>
be able to give him administrative<lb/>
assistance- It was also considered<lb/>
a safer place to locate as regards<lb/>
yellow fever, but as to this he may<lb/>
have had some doubts, when on arrival<lb/>
he found me in the quarantined camp<lb/>
hospital sick with yellow fever-!<lb/>
I was quite <hi>an courant</hi> with his work<lb/>
as it proceeded step by step and<lb/>
therefore will be able to make many<lb/>
points clear to you which may not<lb/>
be so at present- I would be very<lb/>
glad to have a list of questions as<lb/>
you propose, which I could look<lb/>
up in my rather <unclear>volumicious</unclear> files<lb/>
and so be prepared to answer them<lb/>
when I see you- But I cannot<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06282024"/>
3<lb/>
promise anything in the way of<lb/>
collaboration in the preparation<lb/>
of articles further than to be a<lb/>
reservoir of source material-</p>
<p>I have no clerk on office assis-<lb/>
tance, having been retired for 15<lb/>
years and in my eightieth year<lb/>
of age- So all my correspondence<lb/>
has to be in long hand as I<lb/>
never learned to use the typewriter<lb/>
myself - having been spoiled by having<lb/>
clerical assistance provided for<lb/>
me during many years of active<lb/>
service.</p>
<p>The city of Havana, was itself a<lb/>
separate Dept. from the Province of<lb/>
Havana and Gorgas was its Chief<lb/>
Surgeon from 1899 to 1902 when the<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06282025"/>
4<lb/>
Republic of Cuba came into being.<lb/>
He and I were good friends and<lb/>
often saw each other, though our<lb/>
spheres of activity and administration<lb/>
authority were quite distinct-</p>
<p>I knew Moran and Kissinger well<lb/>
I find in my diary that on &lsquo;New Years&rsquo;<lb/>
Day 1901 I went to see Moran at the hospi-<lb/>
tal and found him doing finely with<lb/>
temperature normal- A week decides<lb/>
the fate of yellow fever patients-</p>
<p>I shall be very pleased to see<lb/>
you whenever you come to Washington-<lb/>
I hope however you may not by chance<lb/>
come in the next two weeks as I go<lb/>
tomorrow to Boston for a little visit-</p>

<salute>Yours very sincerely</salute>
