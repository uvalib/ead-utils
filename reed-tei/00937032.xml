<salute>Dear Doctor Rose:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I got here yesterday and have been quite occupied settling the<lb/>
unfortunate quarrel between Connor and Stubbs who took umbrage at Connor's<lb/>
questioning his diagnosis (subsequently confirmed) and who was in very<lb/>
militant mood but has now calmed down. Conditions are not satisfactory<lb/>
to me in Tampico as the incidence of <unclear>Stegomyiae</unclear> has risen largely since<lb/>
we turned it over to Cuaron and I really seriously disagree with Connor's<lb/>
opinion that Cuaron has done well.</p>
<p>Indeed I am so far the other way that I have agreed to the ur-<lb/>
gent request of the oil people to Cyanide the whole of Panuco in order<lb/>
to terminate that outbreak <hi>at once</hi> and I may and probably will have to<lb/>
advance a part of the $5000 estimated cost while the Consejo is trying<lb/>
to get the money. Hence I will wire you to send Scannell more funds<lb/>
as he only has about $3000+ turned over by Connor.</p>
<p>Please understand that I am not blaming Connor, but things<lb/>
are so &ldquo;warm&rdquo; here against him that I sent him to Merida to re-organize<lb/>
there and see that the new man, my old reliable clinician Diego Hernan-<lb/>
dez, gets going in proper shape.</p>
<p>I really can't say that anyone is blameworthy in this matter,<lb/>
as we all, Stubbs, Connor, Scannell, and I agree that what happened was<lb/>
a stray case last fall into bandit country where none of us can go nor<lb/>
have been, and then a gradual village to village infection month by<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00937033"/>
-2-<lb/>
month till it reached Panuco probably in May or June and Monroe accep-<lb/>
ted the Mex. Drs. statements that it was malaria only.</p>
<p>Take a line from Tuxpam, west for about 45 miles or less to<lb/>
Alamo and then count all west and north for 100 miles as the territory<lb/>
I mean and that will bring you to Tantoyuca, from which on north to<lb/>
Panuco is reasonably civilized and, the dangerous, can be visited.</p>
<p>Now, I am going to temporarily switch to the primitive but<lb/>
absolutely effective fumigation for Panuco to prevent a panic in that<lb/>
and Tampico, and shall force down the incidence here to a safe point<lb/>
at the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p>Scannell is doing well and will I think handle the situation<lb/>
properly when I am away, but I shall come back frequently and stay here<lb/>
quite the greater part of my time.</p>
