<p>Memorandum.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item><p>1/ The thesis sustained and proven (pub. May 1900) was that if a case<lb/>
of yellow fever developed in a clean but infectable environment this en-<lb/>
vironment became <hi>infected</hi> immediately (within a few hours)--and this<lb/>
whether the sick man remained in it or not--but did not become <hi>infective</hi>--<lb/>
that is, capable of communicating yellow fever to others in it--until a<lb/>
considerable time had elapsed. This I called &ldquo;the period of extrinsic<lb/>
incubation of yellow fever.&rdquo; This time I later fixed tentatively as be-<lb/>
ing minimally somewhat in excess of ten days.</p>
<p>On the basis of this belief--or rather knowledge, for I knew it--the<lb/>
work at McEnery and Jackson, Miss. was done. The work at McEnery was<lb/>
done by Haroldson of your Board and myself and it was the first time in<lb/>
which an epidemic developing in a town in the South in the summer time<lb/>
had been eliminated by sanitary measures: and this was the measure on<lb/>
which we depended. The work in Jackson (Hunter: Purnell and myself) was<lb/>
equally successful, though on a different line, no attempt being made to<lb/>
eliminate it.</p></item>
<item><p>2/ The Italians (Bignami and Marchiafava) had shown (1898, I think,<lb/>
or maybe /99) that an Anopheles mosquito became <hi>infected</hi> as soon as she<lb/>
had received a suitable blood meal from a man with malaria, but did not<lb/>
become <hi>infective</hi>--that is, capable of conveying the disease--until a suf-<lb/>
ficient time (about eleven days) had elapsed for the schizogonic cycle<lb/>
of the malaria parasite to take place and for the sporozoites to reach<lb/>
her salivary glands. This time is called &ldquo;the period of extrinsic incu-<lb/>
bation of malaria&rdquo; by Rosenau.</p>
<p>The analogy between my finding and that of the Italians was so close<lb/>
that the deduction was only natural that the conveyance of yellow fever<lb/>
and malaria was by the same mechanism.</p>
<p>At any rate this deduction was made, first by Lazear: then Reed:<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01324004"/>
Reed:<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
Durham and Walter Meyer, of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine:<lb/>
Reed's own comment on my findings being: &ldquo;This spells an insect host!&rdquo;<lb/>
Lazear had said (about three weeks previously) &ldquo;The implication is con-<lb/>
veyance by a living host.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be noted that the shortest time observed in the experiments<lb/>
at Quemados between the feeding of Stegomyia on a man sick of yellow fever<lb/>
to its conveyance of yellow fever was <hi>12 days</hi> (in Carroll's case).</p></item>
