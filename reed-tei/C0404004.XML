<salute>Dear Babbie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Received your note a few minutes ago. I am very glad that so much<lb/>
happiness has now come your way. And I know that to be part of &ldquo;the Ser-<lb/>
vice&rdquo; will always make life full and interesting to you. The Admiral<lb/>
merits considerable congratulating.</p>
<p>About not wishing me to go to the wedding; that is quite alright.<lb/>
Dr. DeJarnette would, of course, have let me go, as he would anywhere;<lb/>
let alone my sister's wedding. But I know Ashland does not love me; it<lb/>
is tragic how much better the people who know me and are close to me love<lb/>
me and believe in me than my immediate family (Dr. Freed says it is the<lb/>
rule, not the exception). But I wish you all manner of happiness, and<lb/>
I feel perfectly sure you will find it.</p>
<p>I think we each have a right to be frank. You have already been<lb/>
so about my not going to Ashland to your wedding, and so I will take my<lb/>
turn and say that I think it would be a <hi>great mistake</hi> for you and the<lb/>
Admiral to stop by here at all on your wedding trip. I even think it<lb/>
would be mad taste. This place is an insane asylum, and that's that. I<lb/>
would suggest, and urge, that you do not even <hi>think</hi> of paying me a visit<lb/>
here at Western State. At some future time maybe you and the Admiral and<lb/>
I will meet. I mean this request just as fully as I know you meant<lb/>
yours about me. I am not very well any more, physically (mentally, I am<lb/>
better than I have ever been), and the more even the keel on which I go<lb/>
the less attacks I have; and I find NOTHING is worth an attack, though in<lb/>
my whole life no physicians have been as good to me as all six of the<lb/>
doctors here are all the time now.</p>
<p>I believe that it is the custom for the brid<del>g</del><add>e</add>groom to <del>i</del><add>g</add>ive the flowers<lb/>
at a wedding, but, as a shut-in and a shut-out, I would like it if you would<lb/>
tell Carter Redd that I want to give you your flowers, and I want to pay<lb/>
the right amount of them; that is to as much as fifteen dollars. I KNOW<lb/>
I have enough money in bank to do that, and still take care of my own<lb/>
regular monthly comforts and medicinal needs (about which I wrote Carter<lb/>
yesterday, through Dr. DeJarnette). And I would like you to pick out<lb/>
just the right flowers, and the correct flowers from a really good Richmond<lb/>
florist, or have them sent from Washington, as you see fit.</p>
<p>Harry Thomas is doing fine in New York and all of us here are so<lb/>
proud of him; the Doctors here make as big a fuss over him, almost, as I<lb/>
do. LaF rge counts him among his &ldquo;best bets for the future&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Wishing you every happiness, and congratulating the Admiral, and<lb/>
hoping you will respect my rwquest as I am respecting yours, and hoping<lb/>
that, under the circunstances, you will see to those flowers AND HAVE THEM<lb/>
RIGHT IN EVERY DETAIL, And tell Carter so, and with dear love to you,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your affectionate brother,</salute>
<signed>Ned,</signed>
Edward C. Carter.<lb/></closer>
