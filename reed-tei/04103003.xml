Mr. Henry Schuman<lb/>
20 East 70th Street<lb/>
New York 21, N. Y.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Schuman:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of December 8, and regret this delay in answering.<lb/>
I have been in the Army three and have been traveling around rather extensively<lb/>
the last three months. I was inactivated from Washington just before Christmas<lb/>
but caught the prevailing respiratory infection and I am just now back at work.</p>
<p>I appreciate indeed your interest in the study that I am making on<lb/>
Walter Reed and the whole yellow fever episode. I think you are right in saying<lb/>
that I am trying to do the definitive job on the subject. I have about twenty-<lb/>
five or thirty files actually on hand and have collected a surprising amount<lb/>
of original data, including original records of all sorts. However, this has<lb/>
been in the nature of a hobby and must come second to two or three other jobs--<lb/>
first, my practice of medicine here, second, my annual publication of the Rheumatism<lb/>
Review, and third, my clinical research which, despite my intense interest in the<lb/>
yellow fever story, I must continue, and which, fortunately, is getting a little<lb/>
&ldquo;warmer&rdquo; all the time. Therefore, I cannot promise when I can finish the Walter<lb/>
Reed story. I can't even say whether it will be two years or five years, and<lb/>
since it is all so indefinite, I simply do not want to commit myself at this<lb/>
time. However, I am indeed pleased by your expression of interest in it and<lb/>
I shall certainly remember it later on.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I am still very sorry that I lost out on that duplicate<lb/>
copy you had of Reed's original report, in the U.S. Public Health Proceedings.<lb/>
At one time you had two copies. I asked for one on one of my visits. Unfor-<lb/>
tunately, you were out of town and later sold it. Your wife promised me that<lb/>
you would try to get another one for me. Have you had any luck?</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
