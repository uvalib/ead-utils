<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you so very much for your note of May 3rd anclosing a copy of<lb/>
your letter to Mr. Wallach.</p>
<p>I don't know when I have regretted anything so much as my having been<lb/>
unable to hear your talk here in Washington and see you in person at that time.<lb/>
I am delighted you were able to see the bronze tablet.</p>
<p>The plaque was received by the authorities at Ft. McNair several days<lb/>
ago and Major Simpson, the Engineer Officer, called me yesterday and said they<lb/>
were ready to install it and would like for us to come out and give them advice<lb/>
concerning the details of its installation. I was able to get in touch with<lb/>
General Reed and General Albert Love and we went down this morning and met the<lb/>
Post Commander and Post Engineer Officer at ten o'clock. They had made all<lb/>
preliminary plans and had the plaque tentatively placed on a concrete foundation.<lb/>
We all thought the height at which they had installed it to be the proper one<lb/>
and they were going ahead to complete the work.</p>
<p>As soon as there is a chance I hope to be able to get a photograph<lb/>
of it and will send you a print for your information and files.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for the copy of the letter you wrote Mr. Wallach.<lb/>
I have heard nothing from him since his original visit to Washington some time<lb/>
ago. As a matter of fact, as I have written you heretofore, under present<lb/>
conditions I think it to be very foolish to spend $350,000 in the next three<lb/>
years merely for publicity purposes. General Kean and General Reed and others<lb/>
who are interested in Walter Reed feel as I do about the matter. I have not<lb/>
heard anything further as to the status of the bill but should I hear anything<lb/>
I will be glad to advise you. If there is any intention of spending any such<lb/>
amount, it would be so much better to have a trust fund and use the income for<lb/>
research along lines we know Walter Reed would appreciate.</p>
<p>With very best regards,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
