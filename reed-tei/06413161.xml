DR. CHARLES H. SLOCUMB<lb/>
Brigadier General J. R. Kean<lb/>
2804 N Street Northwest<lb/>
Georgetown, Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear General Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Just a hasty note.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item><p>1. Is Major General Frank R. McCoy still living presumably in<lb/>
Atlanta, Georgia? I am going to Atlanta in two weeks to give three talks<lb/>
at a Post-Graduate Medical Assembly. If General McCoy is living I'd like<lb/>
to see him as Hagedorn in his Biography of Leonard Wood (Harpers 1931) Volume<lb/>
1, page 332 states &ldquo;Twice indeed, the investigation (Reed's) had nearly been<lb/>
<hi>stopped by orders from the Surgeon General</hi>, who needed his doctors and felt<lb/>
that too much time had already been wasted, but each time Wood had intervened<lb/>
and saved the commission&rdquo; (Ref. 23, McCoy from the S. G., 1929).</p>
<p>I've never seen such messages or orders and never heard of them<lb/>
before. What think you?</p></item>
<item><p>2. On page 281, Hagedorn credits Wood with the suggestion which<lb/>
led Sternberg to form the Y. F. Commission. Hagedorn says &ldquo;Wood, thoroughly<lb/>
baffled, appointed Gorgas, Chief Sanitory Officer of Havana and gave him ample<lb/>
funds; <hi>urged Sternberg, the Surgeon General of the Army, to appoint a special<lb/>
scientific commission to study the problem of the origin of yellow fever;</hi><lb/>
(Ref. 15, Wood to E. F. Wood, Dec. 27, 1919), kept the streets spotless,<lb/>
etc.&rdquo; The E. F. Wood reference is given on page 430 as a book.</p>
<p>I'm trying to find the book. "<hi>Eric Fisher Wood</hi>: Leonard Wood,<lb/>
Conservator of Americanism. (Year and <del><unclear></unclear></del><add>publisher</add> not given).</p></item>
</list></p>
<p>This does not entirely suprise me because the correspondence<lb/>
between Howard (L. O.) and Reed in the spring of 1900 shows clearly that<lb/>
Reed at least had no idea a Y. F. Commission was to be formed and in one<lb/>
letter shortly before the Y. F. board was formed Reed wrote Howard regarding<lb/>
quite different plans which Sternberg seemed to have for him (Reed). Even<lb/>
though Sternberg may have thought independently about forming another Y. F.<lb/>
board (but maybe he didn't, as at least two had already failed) it certainly<lb/>
appears that the decision of Sternberg to appoint the board was a sudden one<lb/>
of which Reed was unaware. Perhaps it was a strong suggestion from Wood<lb/>
(in Cuba, worried about Y. F.) which deceided Sternberg rather suddenly to<lb/>
appoint the board and change Reed's plans of which he'd written Howard.</p>

<p>Please used the enclosed envelope for reply. If General McCoy<lb/>
still lives I want to write him ahead of time.</p>
