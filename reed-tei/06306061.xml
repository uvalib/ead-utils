<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am returning herewith your mms.<lb/>
on Mr Bullard's Experiences in Cuba, and<lb/>
the photos of the painting- Unfortunately I can't<lb/>
find the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> page of the Bullard story but<lb/>
it may turn up later- Sorry-<lb/>
I have also made a few notes on the<lb/>
data from the Medical History which may be<lb/>
of some interest. When you get my mms. you<lb/>
will see that I have covered some of the<lb/>
points brought out about the buildings<lb/>
reported by May Brown. What I said about them was<lb/>
all from memory and it is nice to have<lb/>
this confirmation- Thanks for the copy<lb/>
of Lazear's death certificate.  Other important<lb/>
<del>thing</del><add>documents</add> to search for <unclear>are</unclear> the <hi>originals</hi> <add>of the</add> sick<lb/>
and wounded reports from Aug. 1900 to<lb/>
March 1901- The offical data, all &ldquo;checked<lb/>
and double checked&rdquo;, will be found there<lb/>
of every case from Dean's <add>first illness</add> on. Ames'<lb/>
illness in Jan. (I think) will be found<lb/>
also, with a possible diagnosis of<lb/>
yellow fever. That report would have<lb/>
Starks' signature. I was sure that Ames<lb/>
was immune. He said he was and was<lb/>
hired as such for yellow fever work.<lb/>
I have always questioned the story that Ames<lb/>
had yellow fever at that time.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06306062"/>
<p>Ac<lb/>
T</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Thanks for the photo of the <unclear>Loretcha</unclear> Hotel.<lb/>
It is the same old building- A <unclear>barn</unclear><lb/>
of a place perhaps, but they did have a<lb/>
good cafe-</p>
<p>I was glad to have your comment on<lb/>
my remarks on the Hemmeter photostats.<lb/>
your silence (no letters) for several months<lb/>
made me feel that my frank and,<lb/>
no doubt, very surprising statements therein<lb/>
had in some way offended you an made<lb/>
you think that my opinions were most<lb/>
unsound. They were my honest and sincere<lb/>
conclusions made in 1900 and more or less<lb/>
confirmed by the controversies later. Carroll<lb/>
was a most efficient worker, but he had to<lb/>
be led by a man with vision, like Reed-<lb/>
I firmly believe you will eventually find<lb/>
that most of my statements are based on<lb/>
facts. I usually have had &ldquo;both feet on the ground&rdquo;<lb/>
I think and have been a fairly good judge<lb/>
of human frailties. Anyway my opinions<lb/>
were only intended for you, in order to let<lb/>
you have the best possible insite on the<lb/>
situation as I saw it. In my mms. I<lb/>
have carefully followed the views developed<lb/>
by our correspondence and <add>with</add> those <del>of</del> Kean<lb/>
&amp; Ireland- Perhaps I have been too<lb/>
 generous with Carroll &amp; Agramonte-<lb/>
Personally I have no reason to write<lb/>
anything against them for publication.</p>
<p>My big object in everything I have written<lb/>
is to acquaint you with all the information<lb/>
I have so that you can really have the facts<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06306063"/>
Ac<lb/>
T<lb/>
<hi>3</hi><lb/>
as I saw them. Of course I know<lb/>
that you have been sceptical of some of<lb/>
the things I have written, but many<lb/>
of those statements have, I feel sure,<lb/>
been confirmed by your investigations.<lb/>
I realize that my memory is not<lb/>
infallible, but in most things that<lb/>
impressed <del><unclear>more</unclear></del> me in my younger<lb/>
days, I think it is quite reliable.<lb/>
For recent events, it is <hi>worthless</hi>-<lb/>
Sclerotic changes!</p>
<p>There is no doubt about Building<lb/>
no 1. It is the same old structure.<lb/>
The thing you will have to look out<lb/>
for now is to secure it against<lb/>
those frightful tropical hurricanes that<lb/>
strike Havana in Sept. Oct. &amp; Nov.<lb/>
It is liable to blow away like the<lb/>
other one did unless it is protected<lb/>
in some way- The storm I experienced<lb/>
there in Oct. 1906 was the worst one<lb/>
I encountered. Trees, G. I. roofing<lb/>
and many buildings were blown down-</p>
<p>Thanks for the offer to let me read<lb/>
Dominguez' book. I don't think I want<lb/>
to read it now. Sometime later I may<lb/>
ask you to let me see it.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f06306064"/>
<p>I will be delighted to see you out<lb/>
here in Feb. or March- We will have<lb/>
a grand time if you can stay long<lb/>
enough to make it worth while-</p>
<p>That grand child of mine was<lb/>
born the night I wrote you. If I had<lb/>
not mailed the letter about 10 that evening<lb/>
and held it until morning I could have<lb/>
told you about it. It is a little girl<lb/>
and all doing nicely.</p>
<p>In your Cleveland talk there are a few<lb/>
errors I think. on p. 5. the Board saw<lb/>
date on Agramonte's P of Sc M article p 219<lb/>
Finlay early in July (<hi>not Aug</hi> 1) and Lazear<lb/>
&amp; Reed actually were at work with mosquitoes<lb/>
(which they developed from eggs &amp; Larvae given<lb/>
them by Finlay) during my visits in July-<lb/>
I am sure about that. When Durham<lb/>
By July 16.<lb/>
&amp; Meyers were there (exact date unknown)<lb/>
in July they saw the mosquitoes in the lab-</p>
<p>Carroll was only bitten <hi>once</hi> and<lb/>
that was on Aug <hi>27</hi> and by <hi>one</hi><lb/>
mosquito only. He did not believe in<lb/>
the theory but he also was approved to being<lb/>
a &ldquo;guinea pig,&rdquo; Pinto will tell you this<lb/>
I am sure- Carroll did not take<lb/>
post in the tests between aug 11 and 25.</p>
<p>I have not had time to really go over the<lb/>
story carefully- Hope you can read<lb/>
this badly written letter. Am in a hurry.</p>
