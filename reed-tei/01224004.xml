<salute>Dear Scannell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am very glad to get your letter of May 4th., and to know you<lb/>
are in the U. S.</p>
<p>The Marine Hospital in Chelsea was my first station (May 1879)<lb/>
when I entered the U. S. Service.</p>
<p>Stevens, the Dean of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,<lb/>
in whose publication my article, to which you refer, appeared, wrote<lb/>
me, on receipt of it last fall, that the matter had been brought up<lb/>
before their Board and that they were sending MacFie (I think the<lb/>
best man they now have in Stegomyia biology) to West Africa to re-<lb/>
investigate the breeding of this mosquito about Salt Pond: Secondee<lb/>
etc.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that good field men could meet <unclear>thy</unclear> problem of com-<lb/>
pulsory breeding of Stegomyia, yet it seemed well to indicate at<lb/>
once how this could be readily and inexpensively done. If, however,<lb/>
in this region Stegomyia breeds in ponds: puddles: dtiches etc. with-<lb/>
out <unclear>compulsion</unclear> (and that this be general) I feel sure that while the<lb/>
problem would be soluble that the cost would be prohibitive to do so--<lb/>
being, I should say, from 100 to.1,000 times as great as if it only<lb/>
used collections of water in artificial containers or similar things,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01224005"/>
things,<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
and if I were sure it did so, I would not advise the I. H. B. to attempt<lb/>
work in this region.</p>
<p>I believe with you that with the men that the I. H. B. has in Brazil<lb/>
and elsewhere that it should be able to clean up West Africa, but I pro-<lb/>
foundly doubt if the word &ldquo;soon&rdquo; could be put in this sentence before &ldquo;be<lb/>
able&rdquo; as you place it.</p>
<p>I am not as well as you could wish, being confined to my bed practi-<lb/>
cally since the 2nd. of January and absolutely for a little over three<lb/>
weeks. I am still trying to work a little, however, and if you can come<lb/>
to Washington both Laura and I will be glad to see Mrs. Scannell: &ldquo;Sonny&rdquo;<lb/>
and yourself or any one of you.</p>
<p>With very best wishes to you all from us both,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly your friend,</salute>
Enclosure.<lb/>
</closer>
