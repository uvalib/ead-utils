<title>Letter from Walter Reed to Emilie Lawrence Reed, December 31, 1900</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>This is the famous New Year's Eve letter. Reed's toothache requires cocaine treatment. Reed comments on La Roche's <hi>Yellow Fever</hi> (1853), and his own role in the historic discovery. He hears taps sound for the old year, and celebrations for New Year's Day. He requests orders to return to the United States in six weeks.</p>

<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>If my letter<lb/>
of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> did well in reaching<lb/>
you on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, yours of the<lb/>
latter date made just as good<lb/>
time nearly, for I got it this<lb/>
morning -- your dear letters<lb/>
now come through very<lb/>
promptly, and all of them are<lb/>
written in such a cheerful<lb/>
strain, that it makes me<lb/>
very happy whenever I get<lb/>
them- Of course, no one suf-<lb/>
fering with your foot, as<lb/>
you did, could possibly<lb/>
write cheerful letters-<lb/>
Even with a growling tooth<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02262002"/>
I feel cross and ill-natured.<lb/>
All day long my old &ldquo;snag&rdquo;<lb/>
has growled and groaned<lb/>
as if it proposed to take ad-<lb/>
vantage fully of every re-<lb/>
maining hour and minute of<lb/>
the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Century- I even had<lb/>
to seek relief from the appli-<lb/>
cation of Cocaine just before<lb/>
6 o'clock -- this evening- It has<lb/>
about reached the height<lb/>
of its anger, so that I expect<lb/>
to be more comfortable by<lb/>
tomorrow- Out it goes, just<lb/>
as soon as I can reach a<lb/>
dentist- It has tresspassed<lb/>
on my forbearance and good<lb/>
nature just once too often-<lb/>
Say, sweet Miss Gouty,<lb/>
tell me about that cake<lb/>
you sent! When &amp; how did<lb/>
you send it? by express?<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02262003"/>
If so, it hasn't reached Hava-<lb/>
na yet -- at least, it hasn't<lb/>
escaped from the Havana<lb/>
custom-house. I had for-<lb/>
gotten to thank my sweet wifie<lb/>
for her thoughtfulness in send-<lb/>
-ing it, and will certainly en-<lb/>
joy it, when it once arrives,<lb/>
as it will after awhile!<lb/>
I would have gone to Cap't.<lb/>
Slocum's, this evening, to see<lb/>
the old year out &amp; the new<lb/>
in, but my face felt so un-<lb/>
comfortable that I thought<lb/>
that I had better stay at<lb/>
home and retire early-<lb/>
Last evening, I called on Col.<lb/>
&amp; Mrs. Burton, whom you will<lb/>
remember as our next door<lb/>
neighbors at Fort Sidney-<lb/>
They are very pleasant people<lb/>
and the Colonel has been par-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02262004"/>
ticularly courteous to me, since<lb/>
I have been down here- The<lb/>
little girls whom you will probably<lb/>
recall, are now grown young<lb/>
ladies, -- one being married to<lb/>
an officer- I don't pretend to do<lb/>
much visiting here, for the gar-<lb/>
rison is so large that one could<lb/>
spend half his time in making<lb/>
calls- I occasionally get out<lb/>
and make a few &amp; then feel<lb/>
<hi>so thankful</hi> when I don't have<lb/>
to go out. But I'll <hi>make some</hi><lb/>
visits with you, sweetheart,<lb/>
when I get back! Oh! yes I<lb/>
will -- with my long-tail coat and<lb/>
my very high hat! won't we<lb/>
cut a &ldquo;figer&rdquo;? well, I should<lb/>
say so! I wonder what my<lb/>
precious girls are doing to-<lb/>
night? Staying up to see the<lb/>
new year &amp; Century in? I wonder<lb/>
if they really are doing so? or<lb/>
is dear little fat love still<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02262005"/>
down with Helen? If so, she<lb/>
will probably dance the New<lb/>
Year in, while Mother, dear, will<lb/>
like a sensible woman, retire<lb/>
early and dream of her Mantee.<lb/>
<hi>Boom</hi>! There goes the nine<lb/>
o'clock gun, fired from Morro<lb/>
Castle! we hear it here very<lb/>
plainly on a quiet night, as<lb/>
this is. Not only is it a quiet<lb/>
night, but it is a most beau-<lb/>
tiful moonlit night- just such<lb/>
an one as we might have<lb/>
at our dear little Mountain<lb/>
home in June; with the ther-<lb/>
mometer standing in my room<lb/>
at 77&deg;! It is impossible to<lb/>
think of such a balmy, warm<lb/>
night, as being the 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of<lb/>
December! What a country<lb/>
for a heavenly climate this<lb/>
Cuba is! But I, also, hear<lb/>
the bugles blowing tattoo and<lb/>
I must check, for a while,<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02262006"/>
this letter- Heaven be with<lb/>

my precious girls and with my<lb/>
dear boy, while the moon creep.<lb/>
on through the <del>Heavens</del><add>night</add>! God<lb/>
keep them well and give them<lb/>
happiness through the new<lb/>
year!</p>
<p><hi>11:50 P. M. Dec. 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1900</hi>- Only 10<lb/>
minutes of the old Century re-<lb/>
main, lovie, dear. Here I have<lb/>
been sitting reading that most<lb/>
wonderful book- La Roche on<lb/>
Yellow fever -- written in 1853-<lb/>
Forty-seven years later it<lb/>
has been permitted to me &amp;<lb/>
my assistants to lift the im-<lb/>
penetrable veil that has<lb/>
surrounded the causation<lb/>
of this <add>most</add> dreadful pest of hu-<lb/>
manity and to put it on a<lb/>
rational &amp; scientific basis-<lb/>
I thank God that this has<lb/>
been accomplished during<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02262007"/>
the latter days of the old<lb/>
century- May its cure be<lb/>
wrought out in the early<lb/>
days of the new century!<lb/>
The prayer that has been<lb/>
mine for twenty or more years,<lb/>
that I might be permitted<lb/>
in some way or sometime<lb/>
to do something to alleviate<lb/>
human suffering, has been<lb/>
answered! <hi>12 midnight</hi>! A<lb/>
thousand happy new years<lb/>
to my precious, thrice precious<lb/>
wifie and daughter! Congrat-<lb/>
ulations to my sweet girls on<lb/>
their good health upon the<lb/>
arrival of the New Century!<lb/>
Hark! there go the 24 bu-<lb/>
glers, all in concert, soun-<lb/>
ding &ldquo;Taps&rdquo; for the old year!<lb/>
How beautiful it floats<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02262008"/>
through the midnight air and<lb/>
how appropriate! Good-night<lb/>
my sweet joys, a thousand sweet<lb/>
dreams of father and dear brother!<lb/>
kisses &amp; love &amp; love &amp; kisses for<lb/>
my precious, thrice precious<lb/>
girls in these first minutes<lb/>
of the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Century!</p>
<p><hi>January 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>, 1901 -- 9.30 P. M.</hi><lb/>
What a perfectly beautiful<lb/>
day this first of the year has<lb/>
been! It has been such a<lb/>
perfect day here, that I<lb/>
can hardly believe but that<lb/>
you have, also, had a nice<lb/>
day in Washington- At<lb/>
noon, we paid our respects<lb/>
to the C.O., and at 2 P.M. went<lb/>
over to see the horse-races-<lb/>
Cuban horses ridden by<lb/>
Cuban riders- It was lots<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02262009"/>
of fun, sport and excite-<lb/>
ment and I enjoyed it very<lb/>
much- The gesticulations<lb/>
and chattering of the crowd<lb/>
<del>was</del><add>were</add> even better than the<lb/>
races- Had a real good<lb/>
dinner -- chicken -- sliced<lb/>
tomatoes with mayonnaise,<lb/>
ice-cream &amp; cake &amp; c -- we<lb/>
don't often have such a<lb/>
good bill of fare, and hence<lb/>
it was duly appreciated.<lb/>
Jerusalem! if I could only<lb/>
<hi>once more</hi> get a <hi>real good</hi><lb/>
cup of <hi>coffee</hi>, what would<lb/>
I not give! Ours is simply<lb/>
<hi>vile</hi> and I swallow it always<lb/>
under protest! Have some<lb/>
for me when I get back<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02262010"/>
lovie, dear- I celebrated<lb/>
the day by writing to Gen.<lb/>
Sternberg &amp; requested him to<lb/>
have the order for our return<lb/>
issued, so that we could<lb/>
leave here right after the<lb/>
Close of the Pan-American<lb/>
Congress. Six weeks from<lb/>
to-day, sweetheart, I hope<lb/>
to be back with my pre-<lb/>
cious children- I enclose a<lb/>
check for <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>312.<hi rend="superscript">50</hi> which you<lb/>
must have Beechner deposit<lb/>
for you- I wrote to Mr Meyers to send<lb/>
him over for it- You don't have<lb/>
to endorse the check, lovie, dear-<lb/>
I sat up so late, last night, sweet-<lb/>
heart that I am going to bed<lb/>
early to-night &amp; will mail this<lb/>
before I retire- Send expenses for<lb/>
December- Love &amp; Kisses for my<lb/>
dear, sweet girls.</p>
