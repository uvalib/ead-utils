<p>The day was<lb/>
ushered in with what promised to be<lb/>
a severe snow-storm, but ere noon<lb/>
arrived, the snow had ceased to fall,<lb/>
its place being usurped by a<lb/>
pouring rain, making altogether<lb/>
as disagreeable a day as one<lb/>
could ask for. I had intended to<lb/>
write to you just as soon as<lb/>
my morning's work was done,<lb/>
but I was unexpect<add>ed</add>ly called upon<lb/>
to visit one of the Officers, who<lb/>
is very much indisposed, and had,<lb/>
consequently, to postpone my<lb/>
letter, till it was too late to send <add>it</add><lb/>
by to-day's mail. It will leave,<lb/>
<pb n="2"  id="f01706002"/>
however, tomorrow morning &amp; will<lb/>
reach you, bright &amp; early Monday<lb/>
<del>Monday</del> morning; at which time, I trust<lb/>
that I will receive a letter from my<lb/>
<del>my</del> little darling. The week has been,<lb/>
so far, not quite so quiet as usual-<lb/>
Sunday, I was invited out to dinner<lb/>
at Surgeon<del>s</del> Heger's- Lt. Rossell &amp; my-<lb/>
self- As it happened, I found myself<lb/>
seated at the table with Miss Jennings<lb/>
on my right hand, and naturally the<lb/>
burden of entertaining her in con-<lb/>
versation, as well as supplying her<lb/>
temporal wants, fell<del>s</del> upon me. For-<lb/>
tunately, I was in a very good frame<lb/>
of mind (having, <add>on</add> the day preceding,<lb/>
received a letter from my sweet Em.)<lb/>
and succeeded in making myself<lb/>
agreeable. We dined at 4.30 P.M. &amp;<lb/>
after dinner, chatted till 8.30 P.M &amp;<lb/>
then departed. On Monday, Lt.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01706003"/>
Mercur's sisters (two pleasant young<lb/>
ladies) arrived on the Post- One of them<lb/>
being suddenly taken sick I was<lb/>
summoned, &amp; have had to pay my<lb/>
daily visit until to-day- But the<lb/>
greatest diversion, for the week, re-<lb/>
mains to be told- Tuesday, about 11 A.M.<lb/>
a gentleman arrived on the Post &amp;<lb/>
inquired for Dr Reed. He introduced<lb/>
himself as Dr--- of the Navy, &amp; de-<lb/>
sired to see the Fort- I had, up to<lb/>
the present time, considered myself<lb/>
as being the most <hi>Youthful</hi> looking<lb/>
doctor that ever lived, but this gen-<lb/>
tleman fairly eclipsed me- In truth,<lb/>
he had the appearance of a boy of 16-<lb/>
a mere babe; although he said that<lb/>
he had been in the Navy 3 years-<lb/>
Added to this, he was the most pre-<lb/>
cocious &amp; impertinent young fellow<lb/>
that it was ever my fortune to meet.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01706004"/>
Being invited to remain &amp; take lunch,<lb/>
he accepted- not only this, but he<lb/>
stayed till dinner at 6 P.M. &amp; did<lb/>
not depart till 9 P.M- In the short space<lb/>
of time that he remained, he became<lb/>
acquainted with all the officers, and<lb/>
seemed to know me as well as if we<lb/>
had been school-mates- Called me<lb/>
&ldquo;Reed&rdquo; &amp; slapped me on the shoulder <add>in</add> <del>as</del><lb/>
the most friendly style! I merely refer<lb/>
to this wonderful specimen of humanity<lb/>
in order that you may see what kind<lb/>
of people one may meet with, as we<lb/>
journey along.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding the presence<lb/>
of the ladies, to whom I have referred,<lb/>
&amp; the advent of this youth, I have had<lb/>
abundant time in which to think of<lb/>
my own loved Emilie-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Adieu, my darling,- Ever, your<lb/>
fond &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
