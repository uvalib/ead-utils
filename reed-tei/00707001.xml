Ship Island, Miss<lb/>

<salute>My dear Mother</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am practically out of Quarantine<lb/>
for a few days - about 7 I suppose, &amp; am releived<lb/>
Also I am pretty well through with my arrange-<lb/>
ments for the summer. <del>when on</del> I have the attendants<lb/>
engaged &amp; plans etc all determined on &amp; having the prob-<lb/>
ability of shooting a pilot or so- Henry by an inspired mispro-<lb/>
nounciation calls them <del>&ldquo;pirotes&rdquo;</del><add>&ldquo;pirots&rdquo;</add> -, apprehend but little<lb/>
trouble officially. Well if L &amp; the children could be pro-<lb/>
vided for <add>comfortably</add> elsewhere I would be fairly <del>satisfied</del><add>contented</add>. They do not add<lb/>
to my satisfaction by staying but, although an added<lb/>
care, it is possibly best.<lb/>
I have settled all that now <hi>very</hi> satisfactorily if, or when<lb/>
Yellow Fever comes they will go to the L'azarette, across<lb/>
the Lagoon - which I can isolate</p>
<p>I am suffering from indigestion to some extent, otherwise<lb/>
well, H. is getting to eat again &amp;, except this morning. L. Jr.<lb/>
keeps perfectly well L. Sr. also keeps up very well.<lb/>
It has been too cold the past week to bathe or to fish <add>but the children have fallen in so often that they have hardly missed their bath</add> a long (5<lb/>
days) south easterly storm, but except fleas &amp; days mosqui-<lb/>
toes it has freed the Iland of flying bugs. - (fleas don't fly I know)<lb/>
I had become quite used to rowing &amp; can go one or 2 miles with as<lb/>
little fatigue (<del>&amp;quicker than</del>) as walking &amp; quicker.</p>

<p>The children &amp; Barbara catch quite a number of catfish<lb/>
which are <hi>very</hi> poor eating - &amp; I caught one red fish -<lb/>
about 8 lbs - over which the family rejoiced. They<lb/>
are funny children. H. doesn't like any thing &ldquo;thrilling&rdquo;<lb/>
&amp; stayed out among the mosquitoes until he was nearly<lb/>
devoured- &ldquo;cause Papa was telling sister about Fafnir&rdquo;,<lb/>
in the house. At the same time his own propositions are<lb/>
blood curdling in the extreme - do you rem<add>em</add>ber when he wan-<lb/>
ted me to cut the cooks head off for throwing at a chicken?<lb/>
He is a brave tenderhearted little fellow &amp; as truly polite as I ever saw anyone<lb/>
Both consider Quarantine a tame affair, because I<lb/>
&ldquo;haven't shot anybody yet&rdquo;. L's idea of the reason why<lb/>
Fafnir &amp; other Dragon<del>'</del>s &amp; Giants never ate the Princess<lb/>
according to threat is that he could get a great many knights<lb/>
&amp; princes who would come to get the Princess &amp; &ldquo;he kept her<lb/>
for <hi>bait</hi> I think Papa&rdquo;, evidently a deduction from her fishing<lb/>
experience. I have required for a seine &amp; about July or August will<lb/>
get some fish I suppose. There is some more in the Chande-<lb/>
leur affair what I don't know, possibly we can move into extem-<lb/>
poraneous quarters in July or August. As for ice we can't get it,<lb/>
we will go for the mail once a week after May 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; get a month's supply<lb/>
of provisions at a time. One thing I see, about Miss. at all events, that<lb/>
state officers are in quarantine matters, about as rotten as set as can<lb/>
be &amp; the shipping is deeply in the blues<lb/>
about the change of the station.<lb/>
I have sent John no money since he has been<lb/>
at Billings, he carried $210, with him. Poor boy I was very anxious for him to<lb/>
recover.</p>
