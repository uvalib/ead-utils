<salute>Dear Jack:</salute>
</opener>
<p>(1) I have just sent, by registered mail, under separate cover:</p>
<p>(a) Certain retyped bibliographic cards of (iii, i) of Father's MS.</p>
<p>(b)Bound copy of above-mentioned MS for (iii, i) made by Rockefeller<lb/>
Foundation people in 1927.</p>
<p>(c) -- All of the library cards relating to the latter part of Father's<lb/>
MS, which I brought back with me last December, in order to facilitate<lb/>
<del>MS</del><add>work</add> on the bibliographic cards which you had suggested my retyping.</p>
<p>Miss Brown ha<del>d</del><add>s</add> made duplicates of all these (<del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del><add>d</add>) library cards for me, so<lb/>
you may now keep the originals in peace!</p>
<p>(2) most earnestly hope that I have not kept you waiting for this<lb/>
material for (iii, i). I had intended to send it to you e'er this. One<lb/>
cause for my keeping it as long as I have was that, from your remarks<lb/>
concerning Brinton and Maya chronology generally, I felt that I should<lb/>
do everything possible to make the bibliographic cards dealing with this<lb/>
subject as little involved as possible. This I have done, in some in-<lb/>
stances, by making from two to four separate bibliographic cards out of<lb/>
one previously sent you. If you still have any trouble with them, please<lb/>
advise me and I will go over to Baltimore at any time you wish, taking with<lb/>
me such books as are needed for reference or explanation.</p>
<p><unclear>(2)</unclear> Please do not think that I have forgotten your request that<lb/>
I type verbatim quotations <hi>on</hi> bibliographic cards rather than refer<lb/>
thereon to &ldquo;bound corrected MS.&rdquo; As things now stand, I have only ad-<lb/>
hered to this latter practice when the corrected quotations, in the<lb/>
bound MS. were <add>(a)</add> <hi>very</hi> long and (b) needed little correction. On every<lb/>
bibliographic card, referring to such corrected quotations in the bound<lb/>
MS I have given the <add>date:</add> vol. and pagination of the book from which the quota-<lb/>
tion is taken.</p>
<p><unclear>(2&prime;)</unclear> In connection with the above (2), I have <hi>not</hi> corrected<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0325003"/>
corrected<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
all of the bound MS for Section iii, part i (It would have taken too<lb/>
much time), so please check <add>solely</add> by your bibliographic cards save where ex-<lb/>
pressly referred to &ldquo;corrected bound MS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(3) I have also not forgotten your suggestion that for the last<lb/>
two divisions of the MS (Section iii, part i (Continued) and Section iii,<lb/>
part 2) the bibliographic cards be returned to you in the order in which<lb/>
the references come in the MS rather than grouped alphabetically. I did<lb/>
not do this with <add>the</add> cards sent you to-day, as you said I need not bother<lb/>
with (iii, part i) and I therefor only took such bibliographic cards from<lb/>
this Section out of your files as I feared might delay you through not<lb/>
being sufficiently clear. It would have been quite easy for us <add>(you and myself)</add> to have<lb/>
checked them in their original form had there only been time for us to<lb/>
have gotten in a few consecutive day's work together. I think, now, how-<lb/>
ever, that the cards are much clearer and that when once you have finished<lb/>
the editing of Section iii, part i you will be over the worst of the<lb/>
work--not only in bulk, but in difficulty. The same is true over here:<lb/>
while ther<add>e</add>'s still a good deal of typing to be done, I can now send <del>you</del><lb/>
you any further material just about as soon as you want it. Speaking<lb/>
specifically, as well as generally, what a calamity this &ldquo;flu&rdquo; epidemic<lb/>
has been! In the former case <add>(and <hi>re</hi> the book)</add> if it could <hi>only</hi> have put itself off for<lb/>
even a short time, we'd have been &ldquo;over the top&rdquo; long since and able to<lb/>
say our &ldquo;Laus Deo!&rdquo;<add>..</add>or at least &ldquo;Nunc dimittis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(4) Has Mrs. Smiley begun the final typing of Sections i and ii,<lb/>
or are you waiting until the whole MS has been edited?</p>
<p>(5) <hi>Re</hi> the title of the book (you see I shall end on a note of optimism!)<lb/>
What of simply: &ldquo;Yellow Fever<del>.</del>&rdquo;? This vs. &ldquo;Early History of Yellow Fever,<lb/>
or something <hi>re</hi> &ldquo;Place of Origin of Yellow Fever<del>.</del>&rdquo;?</p>
<p>With all manner of good wishes to you and yours, and best love to<lb/>
&ldquo;the Susans,&rdquo;</p>

<salute>Most truly your friend,</salute>
