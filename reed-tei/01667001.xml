<salute>My darling Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I fully<lb/>
expected a letter from you, this<lb/>
morning, but as none came, I must<lb/>
bear my disappointment- You lit-<lb/>
tle know, how anxious I am to hear<lb/>
from you, my little darling; espec-<lb/>
ially since my recent cruel<lb/>
treatment of you- I suppose<lb/>
<add>you are awaiting</add> the reception of my letter in<lb/>
answer to yours before you<lb/>
write. Mine will reach you<lb/>
to-day; perhaps just as I write<lb/>
this sentence you are reading<lb/>
it. What would I not give<lb/>
to know your thoughts when<lb/>
you have read it? Will she<lb/>
forgive me? This I ask myself,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01667002"/>
and the answer comes quickly &amp; plainly, &ldquo;No&rdquo;!<lb/>
&ldquo;You have wounded her too deeply to be easily<lb/>
forgiven- Her love was once yours, but your<lb/>
own folly has banished it&rdquo;! Too true! Alas!<lb/>
too true, I fear! You remember that I have often<lb/>
told you that I am nothing but a poor<lb/>
foolish boy unworthy of your love- and though<lb/>
you did not <add>then</add> give your assent to my opinion<lb/>
of myself, I am sure that, at present, you are<lb/>
convinced of the fact. And the knowledge of<lb/>
the fact that I have so fully displayed<lb/>
my utter unworthiness of your affection causes<lb/>
me to turn away from myself with<lb/>
utter disgust! yes, I loathe my very<lb/>
existence! worthless, worse than worth-<lb/>
less! I'll cease, however, for I know such<lb/>
language will make you sad, but never<lb/>
<hi>so sad</hi> as the knowledge, that I have<lb/>
forfeited all claim to your love &amp; re-<lb/>
spect, makes me. O! to think that I whose<lb/>
pride it was to <del>think</del><add>say</add> that I would never<lb/>
wound the feelings of her <add>whom</add> I had promised<lb/>
to love, that I should have forgotten this &amp;<lb/>
should have &ldquo;heaped continual censure&rdquo; upon<lb/>
you, my darling, who was entirely innocent<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01667003"/>
this it is that makes me <hi>tremble</hi> for the Future!<lb/>
<hi>my</hi> promises! what are they? And how are<lb/>
they kept? swept away like the chaff be-<lb/>
fore the driving winds! Trampled under foot<lb/>
without a moment's thought! Would to<lb/>
Heaven that I had some stability! Some<lb/>
&ldquo;calmness and deliberation&rdquo;! But of these you<lb/>
say, my darling E, that I have none- Even <hi>she</hi><lb/>
has found it out &amp; whispered it in my ear!<lb/>
This I accept- <add>To</add> the Past I have given all my<lb/>
promises, for the Future I have not so much<lb/>
as one! Oh! the depths of my sorrow!<lb/>
would to God that there was <add>some</add> one heart that would<lb/>
give me its sympathy! As it is, I have not so much as one.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01667004"/>
But whose fault is it that<lb/>
I find myself without sym-<lb/>
pathy? Nobody's but <hi>my own</hi>-<lb/>
How can I expect to have your<lb/>
love and sympathy, when I<lb/>
have done so much to for-<lb/>
feit it! Oh! Emilie, love, I cast<lb/>
myself at your feet, &amp; implore<lb/>
your forgiveness! Do not cease<lb/>
to love me, because I have so<lb/>
fully borne <add>out</add> your expectations<lb/>
of being &ldquo;harsh &amp; exacting&rdquo;-<lb/>
<hi>bitter, bitter</hi> words to bear!<lb/>
In order to change the line<lb/>
of thought &amp; not pursue a<lb/>
subject that is full of sor-<lb/>
row &amp; regret to me, I'll tell<lb/>
you of a reception I atten-<lb/>
ded, a few night's ago, at<lb/>
Major<del>s</del> King's- It was given<lb/>
in honor of a visit of<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01667005"/>
Captain Heap, who had been married to a<lb/>
Washington lady, a few days before- I did not<lb/>
go with a light heart, &amp; would have much<lb/>
preferred to remain at home &amp; read my books.<lb/>
But politeness &amp; military etiquette required me<lb/>
to be present &amp; to put on a smiling face.<lb/>
I arrived about 9.30 P.M &amp; found the parlors<lb/>
well-filled with gentlemen &amp; ladies- seven-<lb/>
teen of the former &amp; 12 of the latter- I was<lb/>
presented to the bride, who was a pretty, young,<lb/>
<add>&amp;</add> smiling creature, looking withal very happy-<lb/>
and I wondered how long she would retain<lb/>
<del>she would retain</del> that smile on her<lb/>
countenance, &amp; when it was banished,<lb/>
would it be due to a husband's cruelty &amp;<lb/>
indifference! I turned away &amp;, in a few<lb/>
moments, found myself in the midst of a<lb/>
cheerful group- There were a few young<lb/>
ladies present, but I did not so much as<lb/>
say one word to them. I left that for others<lb/>
to do- I did not care to talk to but <hi>one</hi> young lady,<lb/>
&amp; <hi>she</hi> was many miles away. So I paid my<lb/>
addresses to the married ladies &amp; did my best<lb/>
to entertain them. At 12.30 the assembly<lb/>
showed signs of dispersing &amp; I took the<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01667006"/>
first opportunity to steal away.</p>
<p>I would fill the rest of the page, if I knew<lb/>
what to write, but as I do not, I will desist.</p>
<closer>
<salute>I am, as ever, my darling E,<lb/>
your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
