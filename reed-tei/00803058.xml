<salute>Dear Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>We leave Lima tomorrow afternoon<lb/>
-or Saturday morning -(day after tomorrow). I think<lb/>
the latter is most probable. Will reach Colon<lb/>
7 days later - We will go through the Canal to<lb/>
Colon, because our Quarantine, for plague, is first<lb/>
over until 7 days. Hence we reach Colon on<lb/>
the 21 or 22 &amp; Panama, where I <hi>may</hi> meet<lb/>
little Laura, the same day.</p>
<p>It is cold here, no fires no fire places. <hi>I</hi> am the<lb/>
only one who does not mind it, &amp; I have on<lb/>
<hi>2</hi> shirts of underwear. If I were going fur-<lb/>
ther on this trip - I would get me a heavy<lb/>
overcoat, which would much in my way<lb/>
in the journey from Rio northward.</p>
<p>However we go no further southward, &amp; it<lb/>
will be <unclear>but wit</unclear>, enough from Panama on,<lb/>
I would have liked &amp; have taken the<lb/>
trip from Mallendo up to Lake Titicaca &amp; <unclear>Cuz-</unclear><lb/>
co, &amp; La Paz, I was so perfectly comfortable<lb/>
enroute to <del>Q</del> Quito nearly 12,000 at one point<lb/>
(11.869). I do not believe that the 14600 feet would<lb/>
have affected me. That is only one pass one of<lb/>
13.900<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00803059"/>
2<lb/>
but the hard part of the Journey - 3 1/2 days<lb/>
of stage, is from 9000' down to 6500'<del>6</del>.<lb/>
However, we are not going.</p>
<p>I can't see why I feel so badly aboard ship<lb/>
I am not sea-sick - but headachy &amp; indigestion<lb/>
It is not the cold for the worst was from N. Y. to<lb/>
Colon nor the heat for it was bad from the<lb/>
2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> day from Guayaquil to with in 12 hours<lb/>
of Lima. Am feeling <hi>well</hi> now. <hi>All</hi> signs of my<lb/>
functional Cardiac insufficiency have<lb/>
disappeared &amp; I had rather have this indi-<lb/>
gestion than that</p>
<p>Tell Laura that I have purchased $<del>29.25 28.75 29.50</del><add>29.25</add> a fairly<lb/>
good <unclear>vicure rug</unclear> from the <hi>edge</hi> of which she<lb/>
can get a <unclear>muff &amp; tippet</unclear> &amp; have a light<lb/>
warm &amp; <hi>very</hi> pretty bed quilt for <hi>you</hi>, I<lb/>
found one that had suited me much better for 33. 77/100<lb/>
but for reasons too long to explain did not complete the<lb/>
purchase. However as scarce as they are I am<lb/>
well satisfied to have found that one. It was<lb/>
what I most wanted, <del>for</del> &amp; what will probably be<lb/>
the best thing I can get. I say from the <hi>edge</hi> - because the<lb/>
edge is long hair, like the Coat. L. has, the remainder<lb/>
in shorter &amp;, I think, prettier hair, - like the shortest<lb/>
of her coat. Only the edge then would make a<lb/>
good<lb/>

match for the coat. It is not as solid a color as<lb/>
the coat. Has some white in it,<lb/>
3<lb/>
On the whole however I <hi>know</hi> that<lb/>
you both will be pleased with it.</p>
<p>July 17: We left Lima the morning of the 15,<lb/>
I had a chance to return Mr Peet's call. Tell<lb/>
Henry &amp; Edward that he said &ldquo;Bertie&rdquo;- his son<lb/>
- a rather fine boy in spite of his name-<lb/>
was in Boston, doing well. Working as an elec-<lb/>
trical engineer. The evening of the 14 to me took<lb/>
tea - all of us at the Alcalde's - &amp; <add>I</add> recognized<lb/>
his sister in law as having been with Laura<lb/>
on the trip to Oroya - in 1908. She - the sister-<lb/>
in-law remembered her or said she did.</p>
<p>We are now as <unclear>Salaverry</unclear> - taking on Sugar<lb/>
coffee, Matte (to be <unclear>swetted</unclear> elsewhere) &amp; Co-<lb/>
ca-leaves Of the latter there are about<lb/>
40<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00803061"/>
4<lb/>
40 bales - very valuable. We should have left<lb/>
last night - Sunday - but there was a strike on<lb/>
&amp; all the workmen had gone to Truxillo to<lb/>
attend a demonstration. They are loading<lb/>
now like good fellows</p>
<p>There are two interesting men aboard &amp; as I am<lb/>
feeling entirely well - I was not going south - I can<lb/>
talk to them. One an American from the Gug-<lb/>
genheim Copper mines in Chile- an engineer<lb/>
&amp; one a Peruvian who was educated at Harvard<lb/>
&amp; is an Anthropologist. He is going up to Paita<lb/>
to join a party sent by Mr Barbour - whom Laura knows &amp; does not like - of Harvard which will<lb/>
go from Paita Across to the Amazon, <del>stu</del><lb/>
to study some of the Indians en route-<lb/>
both <unclear>thos on</unclear> this side of the Andes-<unclear>Quichnas</unclear> &amp; A-<lb/>
maras &amp; the wild tribes beyond. The last is es-<lb/>
pecially interesting, Indeed the Engineer<lb/>
is also.</p>
<p>Gorgas was suffering from a bad cold yester-<lb/>
day, but I think will be well today. I am comfor-<lb/>
table since we reached Lima - except for<lb/>

a very few hours during an <unclear>Anmobile</unclear> drive, with A-<lb/>
merican Minister - All the others<lb/>
5<lb/>
however have complained of<lb/>
the cold<lb/>
continuously,<lb/>
stop until next time. It is 8.40 - I got my coffee at<lb/>
7.,</p>
<p>(July 18: We lay at Salaverry all day yesterday<lb/>
leaving at 5.30. It was a bright day - &amp; the clouds<lb/>
did <hi>not</hi> obscure everything as it did when we<lb/>
were there 8 days before. Just as we left the<lb/>
view was <hi>beautiful</hi>, wonderfully beautiful.<lb/>
The warm tan tints of the sand &amp; the blacks &amp;<lb/>
dark browns of the mountains rising out of it<lb/>
just behind the first <del>br</del> ridge - broken in many<lb/>
places - rose a grey ridge of much higher<lb/>
mountains - 10 to 12,000 feet I judge - w'h<lb/>
caught the sunlight &amp; glowed white, pale &amp;<lb/>
dark grey - with rose colored shadows on them<lb/>
It<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00803063"/>
6<lb/>
was simply beautiful, 6</p>
<p>We did not land, as it would, (or might) have<lb/>
held us in quarantine in Panama. We did<lb/>
land the previous trip - &amp; <hi>cold</hi> &amp; foggy &amp; rough &amp; dis-<lb/>
aggreable it was. We went to the house of the A-<lb/>
gent of Grace &amp; Co. &amp; ascended &amp; <unclear>discendinded</unclear> in<lb/>
a &ldquo;Tina&rdquo; - = <hi>bucket</hi> - from the wharf. Many<lb/>
people from Truxillo - the town of <unclear>with</unclear> Salaverry<lb/>
is the port came aboard Sunday &amp; same<lb/>
yesterday - They were mainly young women who<lb/>
apparently come to see the ship - for a<lb/>
Paseo - Some of them, in deed most of them<lb/>
were pretty, quite pretty &amp; we were sorry<lb/>
that they got off.</p>
<p>I am infinitely better than on the downtrip in-<lb/>
deed feel well &amp; am enjoying the sea for the<lb/>
first time since I left New York. She does roll<lb/>
however when at Anchor.</p>
<p>I have written the report of the Commission which<lb/>
will go to the Foundation &amp; it has been made into <unclear><del>No</del> 6 to</unclear><lb/>
6 copies &amp; goes into the different members of the<lb/>
commission<lb/>
for confer-<lb/>
ence today.</p>
