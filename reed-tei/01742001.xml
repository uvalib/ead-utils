<p>As Se&ntilde;or Don Alberti<lb/>
alias, &ldquo;it shall be most excellent,&rdquo; &ldquo; va<add>la ma&ntilde;ana</add> al campo<lb/>
Thomas &agrave; cavallo&rdquo; (it is not necessary to trans-<lb/>
late, I know) I cannot let the opportunity go<lb/>

by of writing somewhat to the &ldquo;<hi>feetest</hi>&rdquo;; ittle<lb/>
dal in the County yo. &ldquo;How is mantee's ittle<lb/>
teeter&rdquo; looking this afternoon? As pretty and<lb/>
neat as a little picture, I know- And, love<lb/>
her precious heart, she knows how to look<lb/>
just as pretty and graceful as any angel!<lb/>
Husband looks forward with many happy<lb/>
anticipations of joining his darling, Emilie,<lb/>
wifie, &ldquo;and expects her to meet him with the<lb/>
brightest smile and the prettiest, rosiest lips,<lb/>
and such a sweet <add>kiss</add> he expects to receive from<lb/>
those cherry lips as will make him think<lb/>
that he is ten years younger. &ldquo;<hi>A</hi> kiss&rdquo; did<lb/>
I say? yes ten thousand times ten thousand<lb/>
sweet kisses will husband demand, and<lb/>
his pretty wife will not <add>ever</add> begrudge him one.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01742002"/>
And how is papa's darling little Lawrence<lb/>
too, this afternoon? For papa hasn't forgotten<lb/>
his pretty boy! Does he like his new nurse<lb/>
&amp; go out every day into the fresh air and Sun-<lb/>
shine? what does &ldquo;bad daddie&rdquo; think of his<lb/>
colored &ldquo;mamy&rdquo; any way? Have you bought<lb/>
him a pretty, nice carriage to ride him in,<lb/>
my darling E.? And got plenty of new clothes<lb/>
for our little son? Now, mother, don't you<lb/>
go &amp; let other children dress better than old<lb/>
&ldquo;didn't didn't day,&rdquo; you hear? You know,<lb/>
mother, that he is just as pretty as any of<lb/>
them &amp; he must be given every chance to<lb/>
shine- But husband knows enough of his<lb/>
loved Emilie &amp; her good taste, to rest sat-<lb/>
isfied that no child will look neater and<lb/>
nicer than his &amp; her darling little son-<lb/>
Do you kiss him, my darling wife, forty<lb/>
times every day for his own dear papa?<lb/>
Does he never say anything about papa<lb/>
or seem to miss him any? Don't let him<lb/>
forget me, my precious E., but talk to him<lb/>
about papa <hi>every day</hi>. By the way, dar-<lb/>
ling, while I think of it, please don't al-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01742003"/>
low him to break up his habit of being<lb/>
put to sleep without any rocking or nur-<lb/>
sing of any kind- If his old colored mother<lb/>
begins to spoil him, stop her at once, my<lb/>
lovely wife. I am so anxious to get a<lb/>
letter, a long one, from you, darling, telling<lb/>
me all about your arrival in Norfolk<lb/>
and Murfreesboro, and what they all had<lb/>
to say about yourself &amp; Lawrence- Did<lb/>
they think you were looking dreadfully<lb/>
broken down in health? I do hope &amp; daily<lb/>
pray that my loved wife may grow strong<lb/>
&amp; get real well very soon -- and next after<lb/>
her darling self &amp; &ldquo;bad daddies&rdquo;, I pray &amp; hope<lb/>
that I may soon be relieved from Ari-<lb/>
zona &amp; ordered East- You can't imagine<lb/>
my precious little piggie, how happy I am<lb/>
when I think that you &amp; Lawrence are<lb/>
East &amp; out of Arizona- I picture, my darlings<lb/>
as enjoying themselves &amp; this thought makes<lb/>
me so happy &amp; thankful! Of course, my house-<lb/>
-keeping troubles are none at all now- I<lb/>
am a member of the batchelor mess, and have<lb/>
nothing to do but go down three times a day<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01742004"/>
and eat breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner-<lb/>
Shadwicks still remains as cook and does<lb/>
up things in very nice style -- our mess num-<lb/>
bers six, Stanton, Lassin, Mills, Gatewood,<lb/>
McPherson &amp; Reed -&amp; we have a jolly, pleasant<lb/>
time- Mr. Stanton &amp; the other gentleman frequently<lb/>
inquire after you, my darling, &amp; also concerning<lb/>
papa's boy. Mr Staples inquired of you, this<lb/>
morning- They all wish to be remembered<lb/>
kindly- I think I have forgotten poor little<lb/>
Undie, thus far. She often asks of &ldquo;Mittee&rdquo; &amp; says, &ldquo;tell<lb/>
Mittee that in a few days, I pec I'll have two<lb/>
ittle tiney puppies&rdquo;- Her little &ldquo;tumuck&rdquo; is gradually<lb/>
expanding, day by day, and I think she will have<lb/>
<hi>two</hi> sure enough. She says, &ldquo;tell mittee &amp; little mottee<lb/>
that I often think of them &amp; will telegraph<lb/>
them as soon as my little boys arrive.&rdquo; She sends<lb/>
much love &amp; a kiss to each of you. Little Susie<lb/>
is quite well &amp; when I asked her, a few days ago,<lb/>
whether she wanted to see Miss Emilie &amp; the baby,<lb/>
she put on a broad grin &amp; said &ldquo;yeth&rdquo;- she still<lb/>
stays at the Hospital. It is now a quarter to three<lb/>
o'clock, and I am invited to dine at Mrs. Compton's at 4 P.M.<lb/>
As I didn't get the invitation till after eating my lunch,<lb/>
I don't think I will be able to do justice to the sub-<lb/>
ject. Give my very best love to mother, sister &amp; all the others.<lb/>
Be a darling little Emilie, wifie- Love papa's boy, to whom he<lb/>
sends many kisses &amp; oceans of love, a heap- &amp; write often to your own darling<lb/>
Mantee,</p>
