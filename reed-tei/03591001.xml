Senator Ernest Lundeen<lb/>
United States Senate<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Senator Lundeen:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am writing to you as a member of the Senate Military Affairs<lb/>
Committee, which will shortly have brought before it the proposal to add the<lb/>
name of Gustav E. Lambert, formerly of the Army Hospital Corps, to the Yellow<lb/>
Fever Roll of Honor. As you of course know, the Roll of Honor carries <unclear>each</unclear><lb/>
year the names of those who were particularly concerned with the conquest of<lb/>
yellow fever, the United States Army Commission, headed by Walter Reed. As<lb/>
you also know, the particular services of each man were described and gathered<lb/>
together in United States Senate Document, Volume 61, No. 822. I understand<lb/>
that from time to time since the Roll of Honor was created, false claimants<lb/>
have tried to have their names added to this list.</p>
<p>I don't know just who Lambert is, as I never heard of him before,<lb/>
but I can assure you, from my knowledge of the work of Walter Reed and his<lb/>
efforts, that so far as I know, he has not the slightest claim to have his name<lb/>
connected in any way with this Yellow Fever Roll of Honor.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the president of Washington and Jefferson College<lb/>
asked me to be present on the occasion, in October, 1940, of the dedication of<lb/>
the Lazear Memorial Building. Jesse Lazear was, with Walter Reed, one of the<lb/>
four members of the Army Yellow Fever Board, which discovered the cause of this<lb/>
disease. The president asked me to prepare an address on the history and the<lb/>
conquest of yellow fever. I have spent much time in the last three years in-<lb/>
vestigating in minute detail the work of the Board, as I have become fascinated<lb/>
by this story. It has involved visits to the homes of several of the survivors<lb/>
of these experiments, including that of Mr. John Kissinger in Huntington, Indiana,<lb/>
and Mr. John J. Moran in Havana. A couple of months ago, I spent several days<lb/>
in Havana, visiting the former sites of the experiments, and several survivors of<lb/>
the work. I have read everything I could find on these experiments, official and<lb/>
unofficial, and can, I think, properly say that I am familiar with the names of<lb/>
everyone directly connected therewith, and even the names of many indirectly<lb/>
associated. Not once has the name of Gustav E. Lambert <unclear>over</unclear> appeared.</p>
<p>May I submit this protest to you, that continued encroachment on this<lb/>
Roll of Honor should not be countenanced. I should be interested to know on what<lb/>
basis he claims the right of being admitted to the Roll of Honor and I should<lb/>
certainly like to hear the outcome of the matter.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
