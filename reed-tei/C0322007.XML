<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I should have earlier acknowledged your letter of April 30th.,<lb/>
but have been waiting for the reprints, of which you wrote, which have<lb/>
not yet arrived. I am looking forward to reading them with much in-<lb/>
terest, but feel sure that it is unnecessary to assure you that, while<lb/>
they may add yet another reason for pressing the work on Father's book,<lb/>
nothing <del>is</del> could further add to my desire or efforts to do so.</p>
<p>I shall be glad to drop you a note once a we<del>k</del><add>e</add>k as to the pro-<lb/>
gress of the work. Indeed, I have wondered before now as to whether it<lb/>
would not be better for me to take a little time from the work to write<lb/>
more about it. I've been so desperately anxious to finish, however,<lb/>
that I've always ended by working up to my absolute limit each day and<lb/>
have been too tired when I stopped to do anything else. This, both be-<lb/>
fore and after I went to the Hopkins, as wellas during the last two<lb/>
weeks of my stay there when I was working four hours daily, under Dr.<lb/>
Thayer's supervision. Since my return from hospital, I haven't missed<lb/>
a day from the work and my letter of April 28th. was not to report that<lb/>
I was just resuming work, but that I had changed my base of operations<lb/>
from the Westmoreland to the Library of Congress. Prior to that, I had<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0322008"/>
had<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
gone to the Library when necessary, but had generally worked up the re-su<del>o</del><add>l</add>ts at home.</p>
<p>Miss Brown, of whom I wrote you, and I are making very satisfac-<lb/>
tory progress on the bibliography. We began with the Section on Africa, Dr.<lb/>
Frost having agreed with me that this part, being especially difficult from<lb/>
a linguistic standpoint, had best be undertaken first. Miss Brown is giving<lb/>
me more time than she had at first thought possible and can give me yet more<lb/>
later, when she finishes some other outside work. In addition to what we did<lb/>
last week we accomplished a lot together last Sunday.</p>
<p>In connection with Miss Brown's services I would again respectfully<lb/>
request information as to whether my tentative arrangement with her, as per<lb/>
my letter of April 28th., meets with your approbation. She is turning out to<lb/>
be even more of a help than I anticipated.</p>
<closer>
<salute>With kindest regards, I remain<lb/>
Very truly yours,</salute>
