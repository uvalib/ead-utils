<p>===========</p>
<p>THE MARTYRS OF SCIENCE.</p>
<p>The death of three of the six persons<lb/>
who voluntarily permitted themselves to<lb/>
be stung by mosquitos known to be in-<lb/>
fected, during the latest experiments of<lb/>
the Yellow Fever Commission in Cuba,<lb/>
raises a question which is likely to be<lb/>
much debated: Is it proper to put in<lb/>
peril the lives of those who are willing<lb/>
to lend themselves to tests from which<lb/>
great good to humanity is likely to re-<lb/>
sult?</p>
<p>The ethics of the Cuban experiements<lb/>
would seem to depend a good deal upon<lb/>
the motive actuating the victims. In<lb/>
the case of Miss MAAS, the young nurse<lb/>
who died on Saturday, it would seem to<lb/>
have been the very highest which could<lb/>
inspire a self-sacrificing woman to put<lb/>
her life in peril. She not only was will-<lb/>
ing to incur the risk of infection if<lb/>
thereby she might assist in establishing<lb/>
a scientific hypothesis of first impor-<lb/>
tance in the etiology of yellow fever, but<lb/>
she desired to make herself immune, to<lb/>
the end that her usefulness in her chosen<lb/>
vocation might be increased and her op-<lb/>
portunities of service to those suffering<lb/>
from the disease enlarged beyond what<lb/>
would be possible in one liable to con-<lb/>
tract the disease. No soldier in the late<lb/>
war placed his life in peril for better<lb/>
reasons than those which prompted this<lb/>
faithful nurse to risk hers. Facing<lb/>
death on the battlefield does not call<lb/>
for the highest kind of courage. Thou-<lb/>
sands who would have rushed up San<lb/>
Juan Hill with a shout would turn pale<lb/>
at the thought of <hi>facing less imminent<lb/>
danger in the quiet of the clinic</hi>, as the <lb/>
subjects of an experiment like that of a<lb/>
bite from an infected insect that might,<lb/>
or might not, be capable of imparting<lb/>
the disease he is supposed to carry.</p>
<p>The annals of medicine are full of the<lb/>
records of the noblest and most disin-<lb/>
terested self-sacrifice for the sake of<lb/>
truth. Unmarked and forgotten graves<lb/>
are filled by those who have joined the<lb/>
noble army of martyrs and left behind<lb/>
as their legacy to humanity facts to<lb/>
assist in formulating the generalizations<lb/>
of medical science.</p>
