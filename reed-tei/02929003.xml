Dr. Howard Kelly,<lb/>
Baltimore, Md.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Kelly:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received a letter from you the other day, which was<lb/>
evidently intended for John, in which you said that in a letter written<lb/>
by Dr. Carroll, he stated that he was not able to get blood to test<lb/>
yellow fever at Las Animas Hospital, because Dr. Guiteras objected and the<lb/>
objection was sustained by Major Ross.</p>
<p>John at present has charge of the Los Animas Hospital, and lives<lb/>
with his family on the grounds. It is of course a Government position<lb/>
given to him by President Palma during his administration. From what<lb/>
I hear a number of physicians of the other party would like very much<lb/>
to have the position, and as there is great jealousy in Cuba, as well as<lb/>
graft, he is very careful what he says and does, as some of his colleagues<lb/>
might take advantage of it to claim that he was using the material and<lb/>
specimens obtained from patients for unnecessary purposes. Probably<lb/>
Major Ross understands the Cuban character, and for this reason upheld him<lb/>
in his refusal. He would, doubtless, have been very glad to have given<lb/>
these specimens of blood to Dr. Carroll if he had not thought that it<lb/>
<add>such <add>an</add> action</add> might be used <add>against him</add> by some who are desirous of having his place.</p>
<p>The Spanish character is very different from that of the American,<lb/>
and I am sorry to say that in Cuba, positions like John's are obtained<lb/>
more frequently through political pull and graft, than through merit<lb/>
and scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>I read with great in<del>e</del>terest the book by <unclear>Hopkins</unclear> describing his<lb/>
life in Africa, and have not quite finished it. As soon as I do, I will<lb/>
send it to you.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f02929004"/>
<p>Remember me to Mrs. Kelly and the children, and<lb/>
believe me,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours sincerely,</salute>

B. you understand when I mean this by this letter.<lb/>
If he were to give a specimen of blood, some one<lb/>
might report in one of the Cuban papers, <del>result</del> which<lb/>
are very sensational, resulting perhaps in the loss of his<lb/>
hospital place and his house.<lb/>
