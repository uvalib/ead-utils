<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In reply to the inquiry contained in your much appreciated letter<lb/>
of January 29th, just received, I would state that I <add>personally</add> do not consider it<lb/>
necessary to order photostats from the official copy of the &ldquo;Third Inves-<lb/>
tigators' Report on the Non-Malarial Fevers in West Africa, &rdquo; nor even to<lb/>
search for it through second-hand dealers. This, because I made out,<lb/>
last summer, alternative bibliographic cards, covering all of Father's<lb/>
references to Bacot's work in the above-mentioned report, from the &ldquo;Sum-<lb/>
mary of Conclusions&rdquo; (arrived at by the Investigators in their Third Re-<lb/>
port) as given in the &ldquo;Fourth and Final Report&rdquo; of the British West Af-<lb/>
rican Yellow Fever Commission. Of course, one always prefers going back<lb/>
to original sources, but I feel that, in the present instance, the time,<lb/>
trouble and expense involved would not be justifiable, as we have been<lb/>
able to give specific references and pagination in the Fourth and Final<lb/>
Report. I am very grateful to you and to Mr. Van Wesep for the inter-<lb/>
est you have taken in the matter.</p>
<p>I have been making good progress on the recopying and clarifying<lb/>
of such bibliographic cards as need this treatment--many can stand as<lb/>
they are. In doing this I am only doing what I had originally planned<lb/>
as part of each day's work during the verification of bibliographic ref-<lb/>
<unclear>erences</unclear> last spring and summer. However, after working from seven to ten<lb/>
<unclear>hours</unclear> per diem on the actual &ldquo;trail&rdquo; of the references, I was thankful<lb/>
<unclear>enough</unclear> simply to write down the exact source and put an &ldquo;O. K.&rdquo; at the<lb/>
<unclear>top</unclear> of my bibliographic cards no matter how they looked! The only alter-<lb/>
<unclear>native</unclear> would have been to cut down on the time expended in the actual search<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01306003"/>
search<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
for the references, which I was afraid to do as <add>had anything happened to me</add> no one else available<lb/>
would have been familiar with both the MS and the languages involved, <del>al</del><lb/>
<del>though</del><add><unclear>in</unclear> the other hand</add> I felt sure that Miss Brown could interpret our <hi>verified</hi> cards,<lb/>
even when they seemed involved to one not familiar with them. It was<lb/>
then a case of &ldquo;safety first&rdquo;--keeping what time we had for essentials,;<lb/>
just as after Father developed angina I <del>even</del> made narrow margins in my<lb/>
typing in order to save even the small time involved in changing <add>to fresh</add> sheets of<lb/>
paper, <del>as much as possible</del>.</p>
<p>Miss Brown has spent one evening here this week and we expect to<lb/>
work together over this week-end.</p>
<p>Once more with sincere appreciation of your and Mr. Van Wesep's<lb/>
kindness, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
<signed>(Signed) Laura A. Carter</signed>.
Dr. Frederick F. Russell, Director<lb/>
International Health Division,<lb/>
The Rockefeller Foundation,<lb/>
61 Broadway,<lb/>
New York, N. Y.<lb/>
<seg>
P. S. It has been very pleasant to hear of things West African from Dr.<lb/>
Ramsey and also to get a long letter from Theodore Hayne, who is most<lb/>
enthusiastic over his work.<lb/>
P. P. S. Glad you sent a copy of your letter of Jan. 29th. to Dr. Frost<lb/>
as, should he disagree with me in thinking my present bibliographic cards,<lb/>
<hi>re</hi> Bacot's work, (as taken from the "Fourth and Final Report) sufficient<lb/>
I shall know that I am wrong! LAC.<lb/>
