beautifully and artistically decorated with<lb/>
flags, palms and flowers. The most im-<lb/>

M. D. The platform was occupied by W.<lb/>
W. Smith, Esq., rector, the Rev. Frank<lb/>
Steed, of Crafton, U. Grant Smith, com-<lb/>

exercises were opened with an invocation<lb/>

and of a high order of excellence, and<lb/>
well deserved the continued applause<lb/>

<p>Address of Rector Smith.</p>
<p>On the unveiling of the tablet in mem-<lb/>
ory of Jesse W. Lazear, M. D, W. W.<lb/>
Smith, Esq., rector, said:</p>
<p>"It has been a custom, in all ages, to en-<lb/>
gross in brass or marble, and in the grateful<lb/>
remembrance of the people, the self-sacrifice<lb/>
of noble men and women who have given<lb/>
their fortunes or their lives for the good of<lb/>
their fellows, and the glory of their coun-<lb/>
try.</p>
<p>"When the temple of Apollo at Delphi was<lb/>
to be rebuilt, a noble Athenian family un-<lb/>
dertook the work, and, instead of using the<lb/>
common stone of the country called for by<lb/>
the contract, used Parian marble in its con-<lb/>
struction. They have their reward in the<lb/>
admiration of all civilized people since. Mr.<lb/>
Wood excavating the ruins of the city of<lb/>
Ephesus, found tablets commemorating the<lb/>
noble and disinterested deeds of both citizens<lb/>
and strangers. One tablet was to a corn mer-<lb/>
chant of Rhodes, who in time of famine, when<lb/>
food was selling at enormous prices, sent his<lb/>
corn ships to the city, and sold to the starv-<lb/>
ing poor, cord at the ordinary prices. He<lb/>
sent joy to thousands of homes, and strength<lb/>
and health to many emaciated bodies. The<lb/>
grateful citizens passed a vote of thanks,<lb/>
and set up in the temple of Diana a tablet of<lb/>
marble commemorative of the event.</p>
<p>"When the deep love of Mary, the sister of<lb/>
Martha, exhibited itself in the breaking of<lb/>
the box of precious ointment on the head of<lb/>
our blessed Lord, the sweet odor of which<lb/>
still fills the world, Jesus said unto the dis-<lb/>
approving disciples, &lsquo;Verily I say unto you,<lb/>
wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in<lb/>
the whole world, there shall also this, that<lb/>
this woman has done, be told for a memorial<lb/>
of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>"So we, when one of our sons has exhibited<lb/>
this most God-beloved spirit of self-sacrifice,<lb/>
think it fitting to erect, in our school room,<lb/>
this tablet commemorative of his virtue. We<lb/>
wish others to be taught to love this Christ-<lb/>
like spirit, and when occasion calls, to be<lb/>
ready to sacrifice time, fortune and life itself<lb/>
for the good of their fellow-men.</p>
<p>"Jesse William Lazear was born near the<lb/>
city of Baltimore in 1866. While being pre-<lb/>
pared for college at Trinity Hall, he exhibited<lb/>
those quiet, lovable qualities which so en-<lb/>
deared him to his associates in after life. He<lb/>
was pure in mind and healthy in body, and<lb/>
was a model boy. At Washington and Jef-<lb/>
ferson college and after at the Johns Hop-<lb/>
kins University, where he received his<lb/>
Bachelor's degree, he was a faithful student,<lb/>
and lived a virtuous life. Three years later<lb/>
he was graduated and received his Doctor of<lb/>
Medicine degree from Columbia University,<lb/>
New York. He was two years House Physi-<lb/>
cian in the Bellevue hospital, and had charge<lb/>
of a room for a year, in the Vanderbilt Clinic<lb/>
in New York city. All athirst for knowledge<lb/>
and enthusiastic in his profession, he<lb/>
studied abroad, in Edinburg, Berlin<lb/>
and Paris, and coming home his merit<lb/>
was recognized and he was made an<lb/>
instructor in the medical department<lb/>
of the Johns Hopkins University--his alma<lb/>
mater. After the conclusion of the Spanish<lb/>
war, the government sought him out, made<lb/>
him assistant surgeon of the army, and sent<lb/>
him to Cuba on the United States Yellow<lb/>
Fever commission. The object was to dis-<lb/>
cover the cause, and find a remedy for that<lb/>
terrible scourge. They were successful. They<lb/>
discovered the cause by experimenting on<lb/>
themselves. Doctor Lazear and one of his<lb/>
associates died from the poison of the mos-<lb/>
quitoes used in the experiment. The long<lb/>
hidden cause was discovered--but at the cost<lb/>
of two valuable lives. Their names are now<lb/>
enrolled in &lsquo;the noble army of martyrs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We take great pride in the fact that it was<lb/>
one of our boys, started on the path of life<lb/>
from this school room, and this Christian<lb/>
home, who offered himself on the altar of his<lb/>
country for the advancement of science, the<lb/>
glory of God and the good of his fellow men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tablet is inscribed as follows:<lb/>
IN MEMORY OF<lb/>
THE VIRTUE AND SELF-SACRIFICE OF<lb/>
JESSE WILLIAM LAZEAR, M. D.,<lb/>
OF BALTIMORE, MD.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>BORN MAY 20th, 1866.<lb/>
DIED SEPTEMBER 25th, 1900.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Prepared for college at Trinity Hall, 1880-'84<lb/>
Graduated at Johns Hopkins University<lb/>
Medical degree from Columbia University</p>
<p>Instructor in Johns Hopkins University<lb/>
Assistant Surgeon, United States Army<lb/>
Died while investigating causes of Yellow<lb/>
Fever in Cuba</p>
<p>He gave his life to his country for the ad-<lb/>
vancement of science.</p>
<p>Pro Deo et Patria</p>
<p>The exercises of the day were conclud-<lb/>
ed with a dumbbell drill and dress parade<lb/>
which were cleverly executed, after which<lb/>
an elegant luncheon was served on the<lb/>
lawn.</p>
<p>This, the twenty-first year of Trinity<lb/>
Hall school for boys, ended on Tues[day]<lb/>
June 18. It has been a remarkably s[uc]<lb/>
cessful year, not only in the high cha[rac]<lb/>
ter of the boys, but in the progress m[ade]<lb/>
in their study, Several are prepared for<lb/>
college and business. Two of the num-<lb/>
ber for W. and J.--Roy Hardtmayer, of<lb/>
Allegheny, and O'Neil Kennedy, of Un-<lb/>
iontown. Others go to Harvard and<lb/>
Princeton.</p>
<p>The abundant rains of this season have<lb/>
given the foliage an almost tropical lux-<lb/>
uriance and the avenues and lawns are<lb/>
brilliant with masses of roses and syrin-<lb/>
gas. In fact, this forty acres of park,<lb/>
with its lofty trees and well kept avenues<lb/>
and lawns is not excelled for beauty any-<lb/>
where. Boys brought up amid such sur-<lb/>
roundings should surely be happy.</p>
