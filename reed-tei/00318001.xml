<p>I am afraid I am a day or two<lb/>
late with my letter. I have been very busy<lb/>
lately. Major Reed has been in Havana on a<lb/>
special mission to investigate a disinfectant<lb/>
and I have been detailed to assist him.<lb/>
It has taken up a great deal of my<lb/>
time.</p>
<p>I am sorry you were worried about my not<lb/>
mentioning the box. It was Mabel who<lb/>
wrote to you about the things and as I<lb/>
did not have need of anything I left the<lb/>
whole matter to her. I did not show her<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00318002"/>
Your letters so she did not know you<lb/>
were waiting. She leaves here on the<lb/>
Transport &ldquo;Sedgwick&rdquo; which will sail on<lb/>
or about Apr. 15 for New York.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shuter came out here the day she<lb/>
arrived. She did not seen pleased with<lb/>
her quarters in town. Havana is a strange<lb/>
sort of place and bewilders one unless<lb/>
one is an old traveller.</p>
<p>Houston gets along very well. He is very<lb/>
active and good natured all day but he<lb/>
has tantrums at night.</p>
<p>I have written to the Brandts about<lb/>
having the placards in the windows.</p>
<p>I wish however you would see them<lb/>

sometimes and speak to them about trying<lb/>
to rent the house. Did you make<lb/>
out the inventory of the furniture?<lb/>
The Halls go out on April you know and<lb/>
I would be much obliged if you would<lb/>
call there after they have gone and see<lb/>
if everything is all right. I told Mr Brandt<lb/>
to try to rent unfurnished and if he<lb/>
succeeded to let you know so you could<lb/>
superintend <del>U</del> moving the thing to the warehouse.<lb/>
I told him also that if he could not rent<lb/>
if unfurnished but found a good tenant who<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00318004"/>
wanted it furnished to let it go to him.<lb/>
In spite of the published interview with Sec. Root.<lb/>
I do not think there is any intention<lb/>
of giving up Cuba. Expensive improvements<lb/>
are still being made here. Nearly<lb/>
all the substantial business <del>be</del> men wish<lb/>
us to stay. The impatient ones are<lb/>
chiefly those who wish to get there hands<lb/>
into the treasury.</p>
<p>I received Alex's inclosure. It required<lb/>
no answer.</p>
