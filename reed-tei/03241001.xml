<head>Anwers to questions propounded by Mrs. Jessie Daniel Ames.</head>
<item>- - - - - - - -</item>
<item><p>1. Were the care and observation of the Experimental Cases of Yellow<lb/>
Fevor part of the regular duty of all Army Surgeons?</p>
<p>Certainly not. Dr. Roger P. Ames, Contract Surgeon, U.S. Army, had sole<lb/>
medical charge of the experimental cases, because of his familiarity with,<lb/>
and his supposed immunity to, yellow fever.</p></item>
<item>2. Was Dr. Roger Post Ames assigned specially to the Experimental Camp?<lb/>
Not to the experimental Camp Lazear, except in an administrative capacity.<lb/>
He was assigned to care of the cases at a section of Columbia Barracks<lb/>
Hospital, two miles from the experimental camp.</item>
<item><p>3. What other surgeons were in charge of the Camp jointly with Dr. Roger<lb/>
Post Ames?</p>
<p>If by &ldquo;the Camp&rdquo; is meant Camp Lazear, this was medically in charge of<lb/>
the Board, Drs. Reed, Carroll, and Agramonte exclusively, and Dr. Ames only<lb/>
attended to the administration of same. Dr. Ames took charge of cases<lb/>
when removed from Camp Lazear to the Columbia Barracks Hospital section set<lb/>
aside for them.</p></item>
<item><p>4. Were the numerous other members of the Medical Department who contracted<lb/>
yellow fever, in hourly contact with yellow fever cases which were known to<lb/>
be yellow fever cases?</p>
<p>If this question refers to the members of the Yellow-fever <unclear>Board</unclear>, YES.<lb/>
If it is meant to allude to other surgeons of the Army, the question can<lb/>
not be answered without the examination of records, not at hand.</p></item>
<item><p>5. Dr. Ames was in charge of the yellow fever Experimental Cases and in the<lb/>
Camp when he contracted yellow fever. Was this the ordinary duty of all<lb/>
surgeons in the Army or was it special duty undertaken to advance the<lb/>
scientific esperiment to demonstrate the mosquito theory of the transmission<lb/>
of yellow fever?</p>
<p>I do not know that the first part of the question is correct; as above<lb/>
stated Ames was not &ldquo;in charge&rdquo; of Camp Lazear and when he took sick<lb/>
there were no more experimental cases. It has been stated, (answer to<lb/>
question #3,) that Dr. Ames had been specially assigned in attendance<lb/>
upon the experimental cases, for the reasons mentioned. It was his duty<lb/>
to accept the assignment and he performed it most worthily. The demon-<lb/>
stration of mosquito transmission was terminated in each case, as soon as<lb/>
the first symptom of yellow fever appeared, therefore, the <hi>treatment</hi> of<lb/>
the disease in no way advanced &ldquo;the scientific experiment&rdquo; tending to<lb/>
demonstrate mosquito infection.</p></item>
