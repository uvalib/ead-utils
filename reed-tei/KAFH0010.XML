<p>Havard's Military Hygiene, 2nd Ed., 1914.</p>
<p>Preventive Medicine is at present a rapidly progressing<lb/>
branch of medical science, and much water has flowed by the<lb/>
mill in the five years since the appearance of Havard's Mil-<lb/>
itary Hygiene. Students of military sanitation will welcome<lb/>
therefore the appearance of the second edition. Colonel Havard<lb/>
has brought to this work unusual scholarship and the ripe ex-<lb/>
perience of nearly forty years of active military service, and<lb/>
he has followed closely the progress of hygiene, particularly<lb/>
in its applications to the conditions of military life. The<lb/>
result has been an increase of 300 pages in his book, and<lb/>
while the student, like the lover, regrets to see a favorite<lb/>
grow stout, the enlargement has been in this case deftly con-<lb/>
cealed by the arts of the publisher, so that it has not caused<lb/>
any gain in bulk or weight.</p>
<p>Especially noticeable is the fuller treatment of the in-<lb/>
fectious diseases. It is gratifying for example to find measles<lb/>
which did not appear in the first edition, recognized as an im-<lb/>
portant disease of military life, especially among raw troops.<lb/>
It is easier to accept new facts than to make applications of<lb/>
them, which upset well established points of view. It is dif-<lb/>
ficult for us to realize, that a case of yellow fever or bubon-<lb/>
ic plague is as harmless to those coming in contact with it, as<lb/>
one of malaria or a broken leg. It is thus very creditable<lb/>
to the scientific spirit of the author, that he accepts frankly,<lb/>
as do the great majority of practical sanitarians, the views<lb/>
of Chapin as to the uselessness of terminal disinfections, and<lb/>
the unimportance of formites in the transmission of the common<lb/>
zymotic diseases. If he seems to incline toward the old retual-<lb/>
istic fumigations in the case of scarlet fever, it is in company<lb/>
with most medical authorities, who seem slow to realize, that<lb/>
the time honored belief in the clinging infectivity of this dis-<lb/>
ease in clothing and apartments is based on evidence of the same<lb/>
a priori character and no whit better than that advanced a decade<lb/>
or more ago by our southern confreres, to support their convic-<lb/>
tion of the transmission of yellow fever in the same way.</p>
<p>The chapters which deal with the subjects of general sanit-<lb/>
ary interest, such as food, water, ventilation and the disposal<lb/>
of wastes are of satisfying fullness and clarity, and entirely<lb/>
up to date. The treatment of the subject of ventilation is of<lb/>
interest, because the recent work in this subject of Hill,<lb/>
Haldane, Hough and others has been so destructive of our old<lb/>
ideas and standards as to sweep us from our morings&amp;leave us<lb/>
drifting with only the wet bulb thermometer for a compass. It<lb/>
is handled with much conservatism and at the same time a due<lb/>
recognition of the newer work, so that the reader has a comfor-<lb/>
table feeling of being on solid ground. But the peculiar value<lb/>
of the book lies in its treatment of the special conditions of<lb/>
military life and particularly of the soldier in camp and upon<lb/>
the march. Here the authors experience with troops in the four<lb/>
quarters of our country, in the tropics and with the great ar-<lb/>
mies of Manchuria imparts a freshness and vitality to his<lb/>
style and a solidity to his conclusions, which are given only<lb/>
to the man who has come by long service to know the way of the<lb/>
army.</p>
