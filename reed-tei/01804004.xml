To the<lb/>
Adjutant General of the Department.<lb/>
<salute>Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>The contract of Dr Park Ritchie, employed to attend officers and<lb/>
enlisted men and their families and to examine recruits in this city,<lb/>
having been necessarily terminated June 30, 1892, by failure of appropria-<lb/>
tion, I have the honor to invite attention to the necessity of provision<lb/>
being made for this service. During my absence on inspection duty at<lb/>
posts in this Department from July 1st to 23rd, 1892, attendance was ren-<lb/>
dered by private physicians under Par. 1636 A.R., but this since my return<lb/>
to the city would seem not to be allowable. The impracticability of<lb/>
the Medical Director of this Department doing the duties of attending<lb/>
surgeon as required by A.R. 198 has been recognized in the past by the<lb/>
employment of a contract surgeon for that purpose, and is apparent from<lb/>
the following considerations. The number of officers and enlisted men,<lb/>
including those retired, in this city is 54, the men, women and children<lb/>
of their families 124, total 178. There are 28 families. No civilian<lb/>
clerks nor their families nor the families of retired officers and men<lb/>
are included. The enlisted men at this Headquarters are obliged for<lb/>
sake of economy of rent to reside in the suburbs of the city, so that the<lb/>
persons entitled to medical attendance are scattered over a wide area<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01804006"/>
some 10 miles square. The examination of recruits at the rendezvous<lb/>
in this city, at which is enlisted it is believed more than at any other<lb/>
single rendezvous in the country, requires <hi>at least</hi> one hour daily.</p>
<p>It is obvious that this considerable number of persons and so<lb/>
widely scattered cannot be given proper medical attendance by the Med-<lb/>
ical Director, who has the medical and sanitary oversight of 14 posts<lb/>
and sub posts, whose time is fully occupied during the usual office hours,<lb/>
has only one clerk to assist in the correspondence and keeping the<lb/>
records required by the duties of his office <add>and</add> is necessarily absent a<lb/>
considerable portion of the year on inspection duty.</p>
<p>As a third medical officer 1st Lieut. Mason, Asst. Surg., is under<lb/>
orders for Fort Snelling, thus rendering the services of Captain Walter<lb/>
Reed, Asst. Surg., available, I recommend that this latter officer be ordered<lb/>
to this city for the duty indicated.</p>
