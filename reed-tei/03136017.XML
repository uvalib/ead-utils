<p>WALTER REED, DEDICATION OF HIS BIRTHPLACE</p>
<p>BY COLONEL J. R. KEAN, <hi rend="italic">U. S. Army, Ret</hi>.<lb/>
(With one illustration)</p>
<p>THE WALTER REED MEMORIAL COMMISSION OF THE MEDICAL SOCIETY<lb/>
OF VIRGINIA, MRS. REED,</p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:</p>
<p>IN THE lives of great men two places have in all ages and among<lb/>
all peoples had a peculiar interest and sacred quality--that where<lb/>
they are born and that where, when life is ended, their remains<lb/>
are laid to rest in the last sleep. It was my sad duty on a November<lb/>
day in 1902 to select the spot where Walter Reed should rest on a<lb/>
beautiful hillside in Virginia, overlooking the Potomac and the Capi-<lb/>
tol, in that silent city where the soldier dead of the Republic sleep in<lb/>
their thousands in the consecrated fields that once belonged to the<lb/>
great captain, Robert Lee. I feel it therefore a great privilege and<lb/>
honor to be present also at this spot where Walter Reed was born.</p>
<p>Sir William Osler said in one of his addresses:</p>
<p>Of the altruistic instincts, <hi rend="italic">veneration</hi> is not the most highly devel-<lb/>
oped at the present day; but I hold strongly with the statement that it<lb/>
is the sign of a dry age when the great men of the past are held in<lb/>
light esteem.</p>
<p>It is my hope and my belief that Virginia may never be dry in that<lb/>
sense.</p>
<p>To the Romans the word <hi rend="italic">pietas</hi>, which is our word piety, meant<lb/>
dutifulness and it had reference not only to their attitude to their<lb/>
parents but to the spirits or genii of their dead and to the cult of<lb/>
the quaint little gods the Lares and Penates who presided over the<lb/>
family hearth and the domestic affairs. Their cult consisted in of-<lb/>
ferings of flowers or dainties from the table, and it has survived the</p>

<p>ages in the offerings of flowers which we lay upon the graves of those<lb/>
we love.</p>
<p>It is to this Roman belief that he was always the object of observa-<lb/>
tion and solicitude by spiritual beings which he had been taught to<lb/>
venerate that gave to the Roman character, in the opinion of Pater,<lb/>
its steadiness and regard for duty and dignity in all the affairs of life.<lb/>
I like to believe that we Virginians are in this sense a pious people,<lb/>
that we hold in high esteem the great men of the past, that in our<lb/>
lives we are not unmindful of them, and that we would like so to live<lb/>
as not to shame them. This is a cult which brings the great men of<lb/>
the past into our lives, and will perpetuate their virtues and reproduce<lb/>
their qualities. It is such a feeling I am sure which has crowded<lb/>
the fair capitol of this state with the statues of soldiers and statesmen,<lb/>
has made shrines at Mount Vernon and Monticello, and has impelled<lb/>
your State Medical Society to purchase this humble dwelling, and<lb/>
to dedicate it to the memory of the great man and choice spirit which<lb/>
here first saw the light of day.</p>
<p>Walter Reed was born on this spot September 13, 1851, the fifth<lb/>
and youngest child of Lemuel Sutton Reed and Pharaba White, his<lb/>
first wife. Lemuel Reed, though he spent his adult life in Virginia as<lb/>
a minister of the Gospel was a North Carolinian by birth and it was<lb/>
to the old North State that his now famous son went at the age of<lb/>
twenty-five to wed his chosen wife Emilie Lawrence--the gracious<lb/>
lady whom we have with us here today.</p>
<p>Of the twenty-six years of his army life, much of interest might be<lb/>
told did time permit, his varied experiences in his stations in the then<lb/>
far distant Arizona, in Nebraska, Alabama, Dakota and posts farther<lb/>
west. It was not until 1893, that he became professor of bacteriology<lb/>
and clinical microscopy in the then newly organized Army Medical<lb/>
School and was able to devote himself to the special branch of medical<lb/>
science in which he attained enduring fame. But for this he had a<lb/>
year of preparation in 1890 when he was stationed in Baltimore and<lb/>
had the rare good fortune to study under that great scientist and<lb/>
grand old man, Dr. William H. Welch, now the Nestor of medical<lb/>
science in America. Never was opportunity more eagerly seized or<lb/>
more profitably pursued. Then was made the liaison between master<lb/>
and pupil which profoundly influenced and guided the twelve brief<lb/>
years of life which the fates then allotted to Reed. I cannot now<lb/>
undertake the narrative of even these few years. We have for the<lb/>
story of his life Howard Kelly's admirable biography and many<lb/>
shorter sketches with some of which each of you is doubtless familiar.<lb/>
I will therefore, if you will permit me, depart somewhat from the text<lb/>

<hi rend="italic">The Military Surgeon--March</hi>, 1928<lb/>
which has been assigned me and give you some personal reminiscences<lb/>
of the man as I knew him and of his work in Cuba as it came under<lb/>
my observation. He had been my predecessor at Fort Robinson in the<lb/>
uttermost parts of Nebraska and I had heard much of his professional<lb/>
skill and his devotion to his patients, not only those in the garrison<lb/>
but the poor pioneers who gained a miserable existence by the cultiva-<lb/>
tion of those arid plains.</p>
<p>My first acquaintance with Walter Reed came in July, 1896, when<lb/>
he came to my station Key West, Florida, attracted by an epidemic<lb/>
of small-pox which then afflicted the town. He wished to study a<lb/>
curious ameboid body which he had observed in the blood of children<lb/>
and of the Rhesus monkey after vaccination, in the hope that it might<lb/>
be the much sought cause of small-pox. In the mornings we went to<lb/>
the small-pox hospital to take blood from the victims of that loath-<lb/>
some disease; the afternoons he spent over his microscope and the eve-<lb/>
nings were passed in the broad veranda looking out over the tranquil<lb/>
bay or at the strange stars in the Southern sky while he told with<lb/>
whimsical humor, tales of his life in the West. Except for a few days<lb/>
that I was his guest in Washington, I did not see him again for two<lb/>
years when came the Spanish War, and the fever camps of the South.<lb/>
A board was ordered with Major Reed at the head and Majors Victor<lb/>
C. Vaughan and Edward O. Shakespeare, both distinguished in the<lb/>
medical profession, to study these fevers. They went from camp to<lb/>
camp, observed, studied, and advised. They showed how the diagnosis<lb/>
could be made between the milder typhoids and malarial fever for<lb/>
which the former were so commonly mistaken. Thus I saw Reed again<lb/>
when the board came to General Fitzhugh Lee's camp of the Seventh<lb/>
Army corps at Jacksonville, where the most important hospital<lb/>
happened to be in my charge. The work lasted over a year and their<lb/>
famous report, which shed a flood of light on the whole subject of the<lb/>
mode of spread of typhoid fever in camps, had not been completed<lb/>
when Reed was ordered to Cuba in 1900.</p>
<p>His first visit to Havana was in March when he came to investigate<lb/>
the use by the engineers of a disinfectant called electrozone made by a<lb/>
patented process out of sea water. It was fondly hoped by many that<lb/>
the free use of this fluid on the streets of the city might banish dis-<lb/>
eases as well as smells and even disinfect the sewers and cesspools.<lb/>
As may be imagined this procedure received small support from Reed<lb/>
and was promptly abandoned.</p>
<p>The Yellow Fever Board, or commission as it is usually called, was<lb/>
created by War Department Order, May 24, 1900, and was composed<lb/>
<pb n="297" id="f03136021"/>
<hi rend="italic">Walter Reed, Dedication of His Birthplace</hi><lb/>
297<lb/>
of Major Walter Reed and three acting assistant surgeons--James<lb/>
Carroll, Aristides Agramonte and Jesse W. Lazear. The two latter<lb/>
were already on duty in Cuba when Reed arrived there on June 25.<lb/>
A severe epidemic was in progress in Havana and at the neighboring<lb/>
town of Marianao, where General Fitzhugh Lee had his headquarters.<lb/>
He was in command of the two provinces of Havana and Pinar del<lb/>
Rio which include the western end of the Island, but the city of Ha-<lb/>
vana was excepted from his command and was under another general.<lb/>
Major Gorgas was the health officer of the city, and I was the chief<lb/>
surgeon of General Lee's command, and had sanitary control of the<lb/>
outside country. I had been taken with yellow fever on June 21 and<lb/>
was ill when Reed landed on the morning of June 25 and he hastened<lb/>
to visit me in the hospital at Camp Columbia. It pleases me to think<lb/>
that in my person he saw the first case of the dread disease with which<lb/>
his fame will be forever associated. The board was given quarters<lb/>
and laboratory space in a barrack-like wooden building belonging to<lb/>
the hospital and some half mile from General Lee's headquarters.</p>
<p>The other members of the commission were capable and well<lb/>
trained scientists.</p>
<p>James Carroll had risen from the ranks in the Army and by hard<lb/>
work and <hi>Reed's encouragement and assistance obtained his medical</hi><lb/>
<hi>education</hi>. He had been for several years Reed's laboratory assistant.<lb/>
<add>Caroll denies this see <unclear>James</unclear> 1908, letter of</add></p>
<p>Aristides Agramonte was born in Cuba during the ten years' war<lb/>
in which his father, a Cuban officer, was killed in battle by the Span- <lb/>
iards. His family had refugeed in the United States and he had been<lb/>
educated in New York. He had graduated from the College of Physi-<lb/>
cians and Surgeons of New York in 1892 and at this time was in<lb/>
charge of the laboratory of the Division of Cuba in Havana. He is<lb/>
the only surviving member of the Commission and has for many years<lb/>
been a distinguished professor in the School of Medicine of the Univer-<lb/>
sity of Havana. He has never received from the Government of the<lb/>
United States any honor or material reward for his share in the work<lb/>
of the commission.</p>
<p>Dr. Jesse W. Lazear, the fourth member of the commission was a<lb/>
graduate of Johns Hopkins. He then studied medicine at Columbia<lb/>
and was a classmate of Agramonte's at the College of Physicians and<lb/>
Surgeons. After graduation he studied in Europe, part of the time at<lb/>
the Pasteur Institute. When he came to Cuba he was bacteriologist<lb/>
to the medical staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital and was assistant in<lb/>
clinical microscopy in the University. He spent much time in the<lb/>
study of malaria and was expert in work with mosquitoes.</p>
<pb n="298" id="f03136022"/>
<p>298<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Military Surgeon--March</hi>, 1928</p>
<p>It seems to me that the time has come and is long overdue when<lb/>
our government should show its gratitude for the noble and beneficent<lb/>
work of these four men by an adequate and fitting provision for the<lb/>
families of those who died, and by suitable honors and material re-<lb/>
wards for the one who survives.</p>
<p>The first work of the board was to study the bacillus <hi rend="italic">icteroides</hi>,<lb/>
which had been announced three years before by Sanapelli to be the<lb/>
cause of yellow fever. His claims were generally accepted and had<lb/>
been corroborated by two investigators, Wasdin and G<del>i</del><add>e</add>ddings, of the<lb/>
Public Health Service of the United States, who had been at work in<lb/>
Havana since the American occupation of the city. Their claims had<lb/>
been disputed however by the findings of Agramonte, and the Reed<lb/>
Board was instructed to decide the matter. And they did decide it, in<lb/>
a report so clear, thorough and conclusive that, though hotly contested<lb/>
by both Wasdin and Sanarelli at the time, their conclusions have ever<lb/>
since stood unshaken.</p>
<p>It was then decided on August 1 to study the theory that yellow<lb/>
fever was conveyed by the mosquito. This theory had been advanced<lb/>
by several observers in preceding years, but its chief and, at that time,<lb/>
only proponent was Dr. Finley in Havana. He had written a paper<lb/>
twenty years before advancing this theory and giving good epidemio-<lb/>
logical evidence in support of it. He had even fixed on the variety of<lb/>
mosquito which was the criminal, and had made many efforts to trans-<lb/>
mit the disease by its agency. He claimed some successes but these<lb/>
results seemed to be doubtful. The reasons for his failures, for we<lb/>
know now that they were all failures, were the same that defeated<lb/>
the efforts of Reed's Board in the first weeks of their work.</p>
<p>Yellow fever had always been the most elusive and puzzling of<lb/>
diseases and had defeated the attempts of a multitude of able investi-<lb/>
gators to find out its secrets. A study of Lazear's wonderfully de-<lb/>
tailed and accurate notes, including the individual history of each of<lb/>
his mosquitoes, uncovered two traps:</p>
<p>The first is that the yellow fever patient ceases to have the infective<lb/>
agent in his blood after the third day of the disease and cannot infect<lb/>
mosquitoes after that time.</p>
<p>The second trap is that after the mosquito has bitten a case of<lb/>
yellow fever, even in the first three days, she is quite harmless for a<lb/>
period of incubation of twelve to fourteen days after which she be-<lb/>
comes able to infect.</p>
<p>Now it happens that in most cases yellow fever in the first three<lb/>
days is much like malaria and other fevers, and it is only about the<lb/>
third day that the patient begins to take on the characteristic yellow<lb/>
<pb n="299" id="f03136023"/>
<hi rend="italic">Walter Reed, Dedication of His Birthplace</hi><lb/>
299<lb/>
tinge and the diagnosis becomes certain. So it was quite natural that<lb/>
the experimenter would take his mosquito to a well marked yellow<lb/>
fever case more than three days old and she would fail to become in-<lb/>
fected when she bit. This was trap No. 1 and if by good luck the ex-<lb/>
perimenter escaped it and hit on a patient in the first three days, what<lb/>
would he do next? Naturally he would take the mosquito to the vol-<lb/>
unteer who agreed to be bitten, with as little loss of time as possible,<lb/>
for captive mosquitoes in jars and test tubes are delicate creatures and<lb/>
apt to die, or to be eaten by ants or escape. So those who missed trap<lb/>
No. 1 were caught by trap No. 2 and as we have said none of Dr.<lb/>
Finlay's experiments got by both of them, nor did our board's at first.</p>
<p>Finlay's theory was as Gorgas once said to me, &ldquo;a wonderful in-<lb/>
stance of <hi rend="italic">scientific clairvoyance</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed was called back to the United States during the first week in<lb/>
August on account of the death of Dr. Shakespeare, to put in order<lb/>
the manuscripts of the Typhoid Fever Board and the experiments be-<lb/>
gan in his absence.</p>
<p>They fed the supposedly infected mosquitoes every few days by<lb/>
letting them bite the arm of a member of the board or a volunteer and<lb/>
these were not difficult to find among the young doctors and orderlies<lb/>
at the post hospital. On August 27 Lazear took his mosquitoes to Las<lb/>
Animas Hospital to be fed on yellow fever patients but one of them<lb/>
refused to bite. It happened that this insect had bitten a man in the<lb/>
second day of fever twelve days before and was thus past both traps<lb/>
and was what we came to call &ldquo;loaded,&rdquo; but this fact was not then ap-<lb/>
preciated. As the insect appeared to be weak and liable to die <hi>Carroll<lb/>
offered to feed it on his arm and did so. On the thirtieth Carroll felt<lb/>
badly and had a chill. He was thought to have malaria and no one<lb/>
thought of yellow fever until the symptoms of that disease were ap-<lb/>
parent. Carroll thought so little of the mosquito bite and was so far<lb/>
from regarding it as a scientific experiment that he went into the in-<lb/>
fected zone and even into the post mortem room where Agramonte was</hi> <add>I think it</add><lb/>
<hi>conducting an autopsy on a yellow fever case. This greatly vexed</hi> <add>was not a</add><lb/>
<hi>Reed when he returned and heard of it as it vitiated to a large extent</hi> <add>YF case</add><lb/>
<hi>the value of the case as an experiment</hi>. When Carroll's diagnosis be- <add>see Reed</add><lb/>
came clear, Lazear and Agramonte were greatly troubled, but deter- <add><unclear>Senate</unclear> Doc p 65</add><lb/>
mined to verify the virulence of this mosquito by putting her on the<lb/>
first volunteer who presented himself. A young soldier of the Seventh<lb/>
Cavalry, Private Wm. H. Dean, came by the laboratory soon after they<lb/>
had agreed to do this (August 31) and readily agreed to feed the<lb/>
mosquitoes. He became sick five days later and as he had been in the<lb/>
quarantined camp all the time and so could not have acquired yellow<lb/>
<pb n="300" id="f03136024"/>
300<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Military Surgeon--March</hi>, 1928<lb/>
fever in any other way, the demonstration of mosquito conveyance<lb/>
was perfect. A little later Lazear was bitten while feeding his mos-<lb/>
quitoes in a yellow fever ward by a mosquito not of his flock, and died<lb/>
September 25 after a few days' suffering of yellow fever in its most<lb/>
malignant form. His case as a demonstration was of even less value<lb/>
than Carroll's as he had been in frequent contact with cases of yellow<lb/>
fever. Such were the conditions when Reed returned from the United<lb/>
States a few days after Lazear's death. The three cases, especially<lb/>
that of Dean, convinced him and he determined to hasten back to the<lb/>
United States to report these cases to the American Public Health<lb/>
Association and also to consult the surgeon general and his wise men-<lb/>
tor, Dr. Welch, as to the next steps to be taken, for it was evident<lb/>
that this small and imperfectly controlled series of cases was not suf-<lb/>
ficient to convince the medical profession and the general public.</p>
<p>I had at that time returned from a short sick leave in the States<lb/>
and was chief surgeon at General Fitzhugh Lee's Headquarters. When<lb/>
<add>Oct 11</add> Reed mentioned to me on October 11 his intention to go to Havana <hi>next<lb/>
day</hi> to get General Wood's permission to go to the United States, I<lb/>
offered to get transportation and take him down. Accordingly,<lb/>
through the courtesy of the adjutant general, Major Michie, I got per-<lb/>
<add>Oct 12</add> mission to use General Lee's fine horses and carriage and so we drove<lb/>
down in great style. When we were on the road I urged him to ask<lb/>
General Wood for a considerable sum of money to pay the expenses<lb/>
of a series of experiments and give liberal bonuses to Spanish immi-<lb/>
grants, who I was sure could be induced in that way to volunteer,<lb/>
especially as they came to Cuba with always the probability of having<lb/>
yellow fever. He did not commit himself as to what he would do, and<lb/>
I awaited the interview with keen interest.</p>
<p>General Wood received us graciously as he knew us both well and<lb/>
had taken a course of study under Reed. They stood facing each other<lb/>
in the embrasure of a window of the palace looking out on the Plaza<lb/>
de las Armas and to me, a silent observer, it was a most dramatic<lb/>
scene with all the setting of a great historic moment. Looking out<lb/>
between them I could see <del>Morro Castle</del><unclear><add>Cobara</add></unclear> and the blue waters of the<lb/>
harbor and on our left the ancient fort La Fuerza, built by the gallant<lb/>
De Soto before he sailed northward to find his grave in the turbid<lb/>
current of the Mississippi. The two men offered a singular contrast<lb/>
in their appearance. General Wood, massive, leonine, impassive; Reed,<lb/>
slender, alert, with mobile features and sparkling blue eyes as he told<lb/>
the story of the three cases and summed up the evidence. Then, after<lb/>
a moment's pause, he said very earnestly, &ldquo;General Wood will you<lb/>
give me $10,000 to continue and complete these experiments?&rdquo; Gen-<lb/>
<pb n="301" id="f03136025"/>
<hi rend="italic">Walter Reed, Dedication of His Birthplace</hi><lb/>
301<lb/>
eral Wood's reply came almost without hesitation--&ldquo;I have this morn-<lb/>
ing signed a warrant for that amount to aid the police in the capture<lb/>
of criminals, and surely this work is of more importance to Cuba than<lb/>
the catching of a few thieves. I will give you $10,000 and if that<lb/>
proves insufficient I will give you $10,000 more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We said good day to the military governor and with joyous hearts<lb/>
betook ourselves to the <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi> restaurant where we celebrated this<lb/>
happy outcome with a good luncheon and I pledged his success and<lb/>
future fame in a bottle of Rioja Clarete.</p>
<p><hi>Next day</hi> Reed sailed for New York and read his paper before the <add>Was this Oct 13?</add><lb/>
American Public Health Association on October 24. There he en- <lb/>
countered Wasdin full of his demonstration that B. Sanarelli was its<lb/>
cause and that it was transmitted through the respiratory channel like<lb/>
measles or grippe. The clash was sharp, bitter and personal on Was-<lb/>
din's part; courteous and impersonal on Reed's but conclusive that the<lb/>
organism which had led Wasdin and the rest of the world astray was<lb/>
common in the tropics and was simply accidentally present in the<lb/>
bodies of some cases, and it was in fact a member of the hog cholera<lb/>
group of bacteria.</p>
<p>Reed did not linger to enjoy his victory and <del>four</del><add>ten</add> days later he<lb/>
was back in Cuba eager to take up the work with all the facilities<lb/>
which General Wood's financial and moral support placed in his hands.</p>
<p>When Reed applied for the promised money General Wood told<lb/>
him that he would place it for disbursement in Kean's hands as he was<lb/>
an officer permanently on duty there and Reed would be saved the<lb/>
worry of it. So this was done and I acquired in a subordinate and<lb/>
business way a connection with this famous board.</p>
<p>The building of his experimental station, Camp Lazear, where the<lb/>
tests should be made was at once begun and Spanish immigrants were<lb/>
readily found who for a handsome sum were willing to be bitten by<lb/>
the &ldquo;little flies&rdquo; and if they were taken sick to be nursed by the Se&ntilde;-<lb/>
oritas Americanas as they called the nurses. A most dramatic episode<lb/>
of this period was the volunteering of Moran and Kissinger to be the<lb/>
first victims of the experimentation. Kissinger was in fact the first<lb/>
case (a noble offer which has been often and fully told). These were<lb/>
followed by other American soldiers from the Hospital Corps, so that<lb/>
between the Americans and the Spaniards, the supply of subjects for<lb/>
experiment was ample. The Spaniards furnished Reed much amuse-<lb/>
ment especially a jolly young Spaniard peasant, named Antonio Ben-<lb/>
igno, but whom Reed called Boniato, which means a sweet potato, on<lb/>
account of his fondness for that vegetable. His contract with Reed in<lb/>
Spanish signed by both hangs on the wall of my office. He was first to<lb/>

<hi rend="italic">The Military Surgeon--March</hi>, 1928<lb/>
recover and when I took his reward to him I got it in ten twenty-dollar<lb/>
gold pieces. The poor Spaniard had never seen such great coins or so<lb/>
much money and his joy was that of a child with a new toy.</p>
<p>The revolting test of the infected clothing and bedding by Dr.<lb/>
Robert P. Cook (Virginian, by the way) and his six privates of the<lb/>
Hospital Corps who slept in them by twos for sixty successive nights<lb/>
was another heroic episode. All this makes it a wonderful and thril-<lb/>
ling story which is well told in Kelly's admirable work.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that his demonstrations carried conviction with<lb/>
&check; them to the physicians of Havana, who had remained incredulous dur-<lb/>
ing the twenty years that Dr. Carlos Finlay had been laboring to<lb/>
convince them with arguments and experiments of this very thing.<lb/>
So then they bethought themselves of this dear old man who was at<lb/>
the head of the Yellow Fever Board and sixty doctors of Havana gave<lb/>
him a dinner to celebrate the verification of the Finlay theory.</p>
<p>Dr. Juan Guiteras, who died this year in Havana, presided, and as<lb/>
I recollect the military governor sat on one side of him and Dr. Finlay<lb/>
on the other. Reed, Carroll and Agramonte were there, and Gorgas<lb/>
and I and perhaps other medical officers. Guiteras with his musical<lb/>
voice and admirable diction undertook to divide the honors between<lb/>
Finlay and Reed. He compared this work to the demonstration that<lb/>
the anopheles mosquito carried malaria which had been published by<lb/>
Ross two years before. Finlay was like Patrick Manson who pro-<lb/>
pounded the theory and Reed was like Ross who demonstrated it so<lb/>
that it was accepted by the scientific world. We all agreed that the<lb/>
simile was a good one and the division of credit just. But as the years<lb/>
have passed and the fame of Walter Reed has spread to all corners of<lb/>
&check; the world our Cuban friends have come to feel that Finlay has not<lb/>
&check; had his share. They do not realize that it is to the demonstrator and<lb/>
not to the theorist that the world of science gives the highest place.</p>
<p>About the time that Dr. Finlay made the first announcement of his<lb/>
theory, a distinguished physician of Washington, Dr. A. F. A. King,<lb/>
read a remarkable paper before the Philosophical Society which was<lb/>
afterwards published in the <hi rend="italic">Popular Science Monthly</hi> entitled, &ldquo;In-<lb/>
sects and Disease, Mosquitoes and Malaria&rdquo; in which he pronounced<lb/>
his theory that malaria was carried by mosquitoes and gave nineteen<lb/>
good epidemiological reasons in support of his theory. But it re-<lb/>
mained a barren theory although it had later the powerful support of<lb/>
the Father of Tropical Medicine, Patrick Manson, until Ross fur-<lb/>
nished the demonstration. Although Dr. King was loved and admired<lb/>
in Washington as was Finlay in Havana, no one that I have heard<lb/>
has raised the cry that he has been robbed of the fame and credit<lb/>

<hi rend="italic">Walter Reed, Dedication of His Birthplace</hi><lb/>

that is due him, as the Cubans have recently done in an official publi-<lb/>
cation in the case of Dr. Finlay. Goldberger of the Public Health<lb/>
Service has stated the case in one pithy sentence--&ldquo;Reed has con-<lb/>
verted a discredited theory into an established doctrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My remarks have already taken too much time for me to make even<lb/>
a brief estimate of the value of Reed's work, or of the vast sum of<lb/>
human suffering and loss of life from this terrible plague which he<lb/>
made it possible to bring to an end. Professor Welch said of it in a<lb/>
letter to the Secretary of War:</p>
<p>Dr. Reed's researches in yellow fever are by far the most important<lb/>
contributions to science which have ever come from an Army surgeon.<lb/>
In my judgment, they are the most valuable contributions to<lb/>
medicine and public hygiene which have ever been made in this<lb/>
country with the exception of the discovery of an&aelig;sthesia. They have<lb/>
led and will lead to the saving of untold thousands of lives. I am<lb/>
in a position to know that the credit for the original ideas embodied<lb/>
in this work belong wholly to Major Reed. Such work, if done in<lb/>
Europe, would receive substantial recognition from the government.</p>
<p>General Wood whose recent death we still mourn said:</p>
<p>I know of no man on this side of the world who has done so much<lb/>
for humanity as Dr. Reed. His discovery results in the saving of<lb/>
more lives annually than were lost in the Cuban War, and saves the<lb/>
commercial interests of the world from a greater financial loss each<lb/>
year than the cost of the Cuban War. . . . Hereafter it will never<lb/>
be possible for yellow fever to gain such headway that quarantine will<lb/>
exist from the mouth of the Potomac to the mouth of the Rio Grande.<lb/>
Future generations will appreciate fully the value of Dr. Reed's serv-<lb/>
ices. His was the originating, directing and controlling mind in this<lb/>
work and the others were assistants only.</p>
<p>It was stated in a recent biography of General Gorgas that Reed,<lb/>
when his demonstration was complete, did not know what to do with<lb/>
it, that he did not see how mosquitoes could be successfully fought and<lb/>
that his attitude in the first months of 1901 was one of pessimism<lb/>
and depression.</p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. His letter to Dr. L. O.<lb/>
Howard, Chief of the Bureau of Entomology at Washington, on Janu-<lb/>
ary 13, 1901, rings with joyful anticipation and in it he says &ldquo;with<lb/>
Howard and kerosene we will soon knock out old <hi rend="italic">culex fasciatus</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
(the name applied at that time to the yellow fever bearing mosquito).</p>
<p>In the paper which he read to the Pan-American Congress held<lb/>
in Havana on February 4, the tenth conclusion is:</p>
<p>The spread of yellow fever can be most effectually controlled by<lb/>
measures directed to the destruction of mosquitoes and the protection<lb/>
of the sick against the bites of these insects.</p>

<hi rend="italic">The Military Surgeon--March</hi>, 1928</p>
<p>This was written at a time when Gorgas according to his own state-<lb/>
ment still was in doubt whether this was the only way <hi rend="italic">or even the com-<lb/>
mon way</hi> in which yellow fever was spread.</p>
<p>Such claims grievously misrepresent Gorgas. Between Reed and<lb/>
Gorgas, I am glad to say, there was never any rivalry or any feel-<lb/>
ing but the most cordial friendship and confidence. Their relation<lb/>
as they saw it was well expressed in a letter from Gorgas to Reed<lb/>
dated from Havana, August 26, 1901, in which he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very happy to shine in the more humble r&ocirc;le of being the<lb/>
first to put your discovery to extensive practical application.</p>
<p>The fame of Gorgas is secure in the performance of the greatest feat<lb/>
of sanitary administration that the world has seen. That of Reed is<lb/>
admirably stated in the citation of President Eliot of Harvard Uni-<lb/>
versity, which is the epitaph on Reed's tomb--</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave to man control of that dreadful scourge yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We here today may make for Walter Reed the proud boast of the<lb/>
Roman poet:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Exegi monumentum aere perennius</hi>.</p>
<p>He has indeed &ldquo;built a monument more lasting than bronze, and<lb/>
loftier than the pyramids of kings, which neither storms, nor winds,<lb/>
nor the immeasurable flight of time can destroy.&rdquo;</p>
