Dr. Wickliffe Rose, General Director<lb/>
International Health Board<lb/>
61 Broadway, New York City.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Rose:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am in receipt of a communication from our local Medical Director at<lb/>
Tampico in which he writes as follows:</p>
<p>Tampico</p>
<p>"The Master informed me that the wireless operator, John Cose, had com-<lb/>
plained of feeling ill, but that he did not think that there was much the<lb/>
matter with him. Upon entering his cabin I saw at once that I had a very<lb/>
sick man, also that it looked very much like yellow fever. He was so ill<lb/>
that I made no examination aboard but removed him to the hospital at once.</p>
<p>"As he had been taken ill one day after leaving Charleston, it appeared<lb/>
impossible for him to have yellow fever. Our examination showed that he<lb/>
had an intense acute nephritis, an irregular temperature, yellow skin and<lb/>
bleeding gums. It seemed so impossible, that I decided to hold him under<lb/>
observation. The case was shown to Drs. Cuaron and Scannell. They both<lb/>
agreed that it was clinical yellow fever. He entered convalescence December<lb/>
2nd. His condition was then such that I felt confident that our diagnosis<lb/>
was correct.</p>
<p>"The &ldquo;H.H. ROGERS&rdquo; arrived at Tampico November 12th, proceeded to Santa<lb/>
Margarita (the New England terminal, about seven miles up the Panuco River),<lb/>
finished loading there the morning of the 13th, and proceeded to the wharf<lb/>
at our refinery. Sailed for Port Lobos the morning of the 14th. Left Lobos<lb/>
the 15th for Charleston, sailed from Charleston for Tampico November 23rd.<lb/>
Cose was taken sick November 24th. These dates seem to make it impossible<lb/>
for the infection to have taken place at Tampico. The only explanation that<lb/>
I can give is that an infected mosquito boarded the ship here. Yellow fever<lb/>
has not been known at either Santa Margarita or the Refinery. The whole<lb/>
thing is impossible - but we have the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am requesting the Marine Department to return Cose to New York, and<lb/>
that he be taken to you, and if you agree, to have him sent to Dr. Noguchi<lb/>
for the test that he makes - the same that he did in the case of Tregar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With reference to the last paragraph of the Doctor's letter, I am<lb/>
wondering whether Dr. Noguchi would care to see Mr. Cose, and if so when and<lb/>
where it would be convenient to have Mr. Cose report.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
