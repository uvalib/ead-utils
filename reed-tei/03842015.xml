<title>Letter from Estela Agramonte Rodriguez Leon to Philip Showalter Hench, September 11, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Rodriguez Leon compliments Hench on his yellow fever history work, and wishes she had more time to devote to the research herself. She has been unable to find the information Hench seeks in her father's papers and fears that the rest of the papers will not be helpful either.</p>

Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Again I have allowed my<lb/>
correspondence to <unclear>lay</unclear>, and I<lb/>
find I owe <add>you</add> more than one letter.<lb/>
Sorry, wish I could promise not<lb/>
to repeat. But you must know<lb/>
me by now, I am afraid.</p>
<p>In the first place allow<lb/>
me to congratulate you for your<lb/>
address at the unveiling of Wyeth's<lb/>
paintings. You are certainly build-<lb/>
ing up a reputation for oratory and<lb/>
I can foretell you will be finding<lb/>
it harder and harder not to comply<lb/>
with ever greater demands upon<lb/>
your energy. I must say I am<lb/>
very glad that the Yellow Fever pro-<lb/>
blem has fallen into such good hands.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03842016"/>
Ac<lb/>
Ag to Am<lb/>
II<lb/>
You seem to have the <unclear>flare</unclear> of the historian<lb/>
coupled with the training of a good doc-<lb/>
tor for clear thinking and with such<lb/>
weapons I am sure you will finally<lb/>
unearth the truth at last. For myself<lb/>
I consider it a duty to leave that accom-<lb/>
plished for future investigators, and<lb/>
if other urgent demands did not cons-<lb/>
tantly interfere with my good intentions.<lb/>
Was your speech finally published?<lb/>
I have been looking through several<lb/>
issues of &ldquo;Hygeia&rdquo; but have not come<lb/>
accross it.</p>
<p>Your last letter and Dr Alber-<lb/>
tini's quoted analysis of the picture<lb/>
of cuban doctors. <del>It</del> is very interesting<lb/>
and he is probably right. I know<lb/>
or have known most of the men, but<lb/>
of course I recall them as much<lb/>
older and considerably changed.</p>
<p>As to the Gorgas Speech I<lb/>
am inclined to think also, that there<lb/>
must be some mistake in the num-<lb/>
bering of the pages. I have not been<lb/>
able to sense any lapse in the con-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03842017"/>
III<lb/>
text. The numbering on the right corners<lb/>
is mine, evidently made before sending<lb/>
to you and, perhaps because I might<lb/>
have noticed some discrepancy in my<lb/>
father's numbers. I really don't remem-<lb/>
ber exactly, but it seems unnecessary<lb/>
to worry.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say I have not<lb/>
done much to get at the odd statement<lb/>
of Carroll's about my Father's trip<lb/>
at the time Lazear's illness. I am posi-<lb/>
tive it is untrue and hope to finally<lb/>
be able to establish the fact. So far<lb/>
I have gone through several packs<lb/>
of old letters and papers to no avail.</p>
<p>I'll have dissapointing news<lb/>
to give you when I say that I<lb/>
found nothing, either, at the farm.<lb/>
I went through the boxes hurriedly<lb/>
but thoroughly this summer: noth-<lb/>
ing in them but reprints and clip-<lb/>
pings (duplicates) of the ones here. One<lb/>
trunk of letters and family papers<lb/>
I brought back with me, but I<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f03842018"/>
IV<lb/>
doubt that it may contain anything very-<lb/>
enlightening. Only, perhaps, the facts<lb/>
about the trip (Caroll's assertion).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the latter part of my<lb/>
vacation was cut short by some new<lb/>
plans and activities. There seems, an opening<lb/>
may occur in the near future at the<lb/>
University. I am intensely busy now<lb/>
on some extra post-graduate work<lb/>
in order to obtain my long neglected<lb/>
Ph.D. as soon as possibly (I am already<lb/>
Dr. in Education) The work would<lb/>
ordinarily take 2 - 3 years; I am try-<lb/>
ing to do it in 1 - 1 1/2, though rather<lb/>
doubtful if I can, on account of<lb/>
my teaching at Ruston, which I shall<lb/>
have to keep up. I am telling you<lb/>
all this so you will be patient with<lb/>
me if I don't seem very active in<lb/>
helping you with what really lies so<lb/>
much nearer my own heart. Possibly,<lb/>
if easier times are ahead, it shall be<lb/>
possible some day to devote most of my<lb/>
time to it.</p>
<p>Please give my regards to Mrs.<lb/>
Hench. My husband joins me.</p>
<p>Hoping you will again come<lb/>
down to Cuba this year, believe me,</p>
