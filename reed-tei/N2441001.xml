<p>The Latest About Yellow Fever.</p>
<p>It is with the utmost embarrassment<lb/>
that we venture to intrude upon the scien-<lb/>
tific ecstasies of the Pan-American Medi-<lb/>
cal Congress at Havana with a word or<lb/>
two of tabloid thought. (Apologies to Mr.<lb/>
Harmsworth.)</p>
<p>We have long watched the yellow fever<lb/>
investigations of our authorities in Cuba<lb/>
with almost breathless interest. Even<lb/>
before our military occupation, January<lb/>
1, 1899, Gen. Leonard Wood, then com-<lb/>
manding the province of Santiago, with<lb/>
headquarters at the city of that name,<lb/>
had inaugurated a systematic inquiry into<lb/>
the causes, conditions, character, and<lb/>
cure of the disease. At first, he thought<lb/>
the problem simple enough. A medical<lb/>
man himself, and well up in his profes-<lb/>
sion, he proceeded with no little con-<lb/>
fidence. Here was a particularly dirty<lb/>
town. Here also was yellow fever. Ergo:<lb/>
Remove the dirt and the fever disappears.<lb/>
In the summer of 1899, Gen. Wood went<lb/>
to Boston on leave, and in the course of<lb/>
some remarks to his admiring fellow-<lb/>
citizens he stated that yellow fever had<lb/>
been eradicated by the easy and obvious<lb/>
expedient of destroying the material upon<lb/>
which it depended for its vitality. In<lb/>
other words, Santiago had been swept,<lb/>
scrubbed, garnished, &amp;c., and yellow fever<lb/>
had therefore disappeared for good. Two<lb/>
days after, Gen. Wood sailed for Santiago,<lb/>
having been urgently recalled by an out-<lb/>
break of yellow fever in epidemic form<lb/>
at that post.</p>
<p>Gen. Wood does not now believe that<lb/>
yellow fever can be extinguished by<lb/>
means of street sweepers, shovels, and<lb/>
carbolic acid.</p>
<p>Havana, also, was taken in hand, early<lb/>
in 1899, and brushed and swept and filled<lb/>
with acrid smells, for the purpose of ob-<lb/>
literating the dreaded malady. A great<lb/>
many thousands of dollars were expended<lb/>
in the conduct of this interesting comedy,<lb/>
and at one time it was triumphantly an-<lb/>
nounced on high military and scientific<lb/>
authority that the money had been benef-<lb/>
icently spent, since yellow fever was no<lb/>
more. The disease, however, went play-<lb/>
fully along upon its accustomed way, just<lb/>
as though such things as syringes, dust-<lb/>
pans, brooms, &amp;c., had never been heard<lb/>
of in the world. Then the bubble burst,<lb/>
and science began to look in new direc-<lb/>
tions.</p>
<p>This brings us around to the Pan-Amer-<lb/>
ican Medicals. These gentlemen have<lb/>
given up the Sanarelli germs as unreli-<lb/>
able. They have even turned a deaf ear<lb/>
to Dr. Doty, the great New York expert,<lb/>
who once made a number of important<lb/>
discoveries by inoculating an invalid dray<lb/>
horse and obtaining barrels upon barrels<lb/>
of serum. He went so far, indeed, as to<lb/>
procure a yellow fever patient and treat<lb/>
him with great vigor. We have been as-<lb/>
sured that he would have cured that pa-<lb/>
tient if only he had had yellow fever. Dr.<lb/>
Doty, however, still has the serum. But,<lb/>
as we were saying, the Pan-American<lb/>
Medicals have discarded all these fal-<lb/>
lacies, They now solemnly announce that<lb/>
&ldquo;the specific cause of the disease is un-<lb/>
known.&rdquo; They also state that it is &ldquo;not<lb/>
due to dirt&rdquo;--something the yellow fever<lb/>
specialists of the South have insisted on<lb/>
for the past sixty years. But they do<lb/>
say that this disease, the origin of which<lb/>
they cannot specify, is transmitted only<lb/>
by mosquitoes. There has been some af-<lb/>
fectionate wrangling on this point, one<lb/>
side contending that all mosquitoes can<lb/>
communicate the poison, while the others<lb/>
maintain with great valor and determina-<lb/>
tion that only the gray-legged variety is<lb/>
gifted in the premises. But all are agreed<lb/>
that the mosquito does the business, and<lb/>
we must branch out from that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we should like to offer the<lb/>
suggestion that since this controversy<lb/>
has been finally settled the yellow fever<lb/>
board and the Pan-American Medicals<lb/>
generally can well afford to cease their<lb/>
experiments upon inoffensive persons. One<lb/>
member of the board has already died of<lb/>
yellow fever, presumably as a result of<lb/>
mosquito inoculation, and that ought to<lb/>
be enough for all scientific purposes. Yel-<lb/>
low fever is not the kind of disease that<lb/>
can be passed around very fluently with-<lb/>
out unpleasant consequences, and if these<lb/>
gifted scientists are now convinced that<lb/>
the mosquito is the real and only medium<lb/>
of infection, why not devote themselves<lb/>
to the eradication of the medium instead<lb/>
of killing more people by way of aca-<lb/>
demic demonstration?</p>
