<salute>My dear Col. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of 9 Jan. arrived<lb/>
this afternoon and I was much inter-<lb/>
ested in it- I will number your questions<lb/>
in my reply to them by the same numbers-<lb/>
1. <hi>Major Gen Frank R. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Coy</hi>, long since retired,<lb/>
is (thank God) still living and is in Wash-<lb/>
ington at <hi>1633, 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Street n. w.</hi> I have his<lb/>
Christmas Card before me now, and he<lb/>
called up by phone a few days ago to wish<lb/>
me a happy New Year- He is a very able &amp;<lb/>
distinguished man- The President appointed him<lb/>
to be the Chief of the Commission that tried<lb/>
and condemned the men that were landed<lb/>
on our shores from U-Boats during the war<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06413181"/>
2<lb/>
by the Nazis to commit <unclear>sabotage</unclear> on our<lb/>
military activities- He was for years at<lb/>
the head of the magazine Foreign Affairs-<lb/>
I have known him since he was a 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi><lb/>
Lieutenant, wounded at Santiago in the<lb/>
Spanish War- I have never heard of the<lb/>
statement you quote from Hagedorn's<lb/>
Biography of Gen. Wood, but I was dis-<lb/>
trustful of Hagedorn when he wrote his book-<lb/>
But whatever Gen M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Coy tells you is the<lb/>
best available evidence- He was for years<lb/>
the aide to Gen. Wood and then President<lb/>
Theodore Rooseveld took him to be his aide<lb/>
and he has always been mixed up in great<lb/>
affairs, as you will see in brief resum&eacute; in<lb/>
Whos Who- You can rely on him- Cornelia<lb/>
tells me she told you two years ago to consult him-</p>
<p>1. As to this I doubt it</p>
<p>2. I doubt this also, but it may be true-</p>
<p>I never heard of Eric Fisher Wood's book:<lb/>
&ldquo;Leonard Wood&rdquo; see p. 3-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06413182"/>
3-<lb/>
under 2. Wood did not appoint Gorgas<lb/>
to be Chief San. Officer of Havana-<lb/>
Gorgas was appointed Jan 13. 1899-<lb/>
Gen. Wood did not come to Havana<lb/>
as Gov. Gen. until Dec. 20. 1899-<lb/>
Gorgas did not beleive in the mosquito<lb/>
theory even after Reed had demonstrated<lb/>
it- He told me, and he candidly put it<lb/>
in his annual Report that he believed<lb/>
Reed's demonstration &ldquo;showed that it <hi>could be</hi><lb/>
conveyed by the mosquito but he did not<lb/>
believe that it was the only way or even<lb/>
<hi>the usual way</hi>-&rdquo; He ignored the experiments<lb/>
with fomites- But when Gen. Wood<lb/>
ordered him to get to work on mosquito<lb/>
prevention, the success of his own work<lb/>
convinced him-</p>
<p>If it was a suggestion from Gen Wood which<lb/>
decided Gen. Sternberg to appoint Reeds'<lb/>
Board, M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Coy will probably know about<lb/>
it-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06413183"/>
4.<lb/>
I seen to have skipped this page so see<lb/>
over for page 3-</p>
<p>Write to Gen M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Coy by all means-<lb/>
Shall I send him your letter to me?<lb/>
Thanks for your stamped and<lb/>
addressed envelopes, but you<lb/>
need not have sent them- What<lb/>
is a 3&cent; stamp between me and three?<lb/>
I am glad that you are going to<lb/>
England in the <del>Spring</del><add><unclear>Autumn</unclear></add>- The rest of<lb/>
the voyage will do you good, so do<lb/>
not go by air, which is quick but<lb/>
not restful-</p>
<p>We had a hell of a time at Christmas<lb/>
Both ill with Virus Influenza-<lb/>
But we are both well now, tho-<lb/>
Cornelia was ill 3 weeks during which<lb/>
time she saw no one- Hoping that you<lb/>
and your family will escape it we wish<lb/>
you all a happy and healthy New Year</p>
