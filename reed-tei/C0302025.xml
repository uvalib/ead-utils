Mr. H. B. Richardson,<lb/>
Colima, Col.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Referring to the conversation which I had with you this<lb/>
morning at my office, I have the honor to present the following report:</p>
<p>On Sunday, August 19, 1923, I was called to attend a patient<lb/>
at number 451 Helisario Dominguez Calle of this City. There I found a man<lb/>
about 28 years of age, with normal complexion, who, according to what I was<lb/>
told, had been sick for six days without medical attention. On that day he<lb/>
had taken a saline purgative causing numerous evacuations which alarmed the<lb/>
patient and his family, who decided to call for a doctor. I had the op-<lb/>
portunity of seeing one of these evacuations and noted that it was very<lb/>
yellow, fetid, with some intestinal mucus and small traces of blood. His<lb/>
pulse was weak, frequent (130 per minute), his temperature was 38 C. His<lb/>
abdomen soft to palpation; by this diagnostic method I found the liver and<lb/>
spleen slightly enlarged; his heart showed no apparent organic lesion,<lb/>
regular, and its action corresponded to the pulsations already mentioned;<lb/>
his mentality was in perfect condition; his tongue was humid, dirty and of<lb/>
uniform color; his gums were also of uniform color; they did not show any<lb/>
modifications along the edges. While with the patient, the latter did not<lb/>
complain of any trouble other than that caused by the evacuations and by<lb/>
the weakened condition of which he said to be suffering. The patient him-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0302026"/>
-2-<lb/>
self informed me that at the beginning of the disease he had suffered<lb/>
with pains in the abdomen and legs, moderate fever from the very start<lb/>
of the disease, with increase in the severity of the symptoms on each<lb/>
third day. According to what I was told, this patient lived in Man-<lb/>
zanillo and had a history of malaria and alcoholism.</p>
<p>As you will note by this report, I do not pretend to make<lb/>
a clinical history. It is impossible to do so with only one examina-<lb/>
tion of the patient as I was not consulted any more. I desire to fur-<lb/>
nish this data to you in case they should be of any use to you, since<lb/>
I have been told that this patient died a few days ago and that his<lb/>
death is attributed to yellow fever. My diagnosis was that of malaria<lb/>
in an alcoholic individual.</p>
