<salute>Dear Doctor Robertson:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am rather complimented at your calling me in consultation on<lb/>
the subject matter of your two Recommendations to the Bureau.</p>
<p>What I know about plague is about plague in hot countries. I<lb/>
have had no occasion to investigate it elsewhere.</p>
<p>Your suggestion that cold weather is a bar to the continuance<lb/>
of plague, and by its effect on rat fleas, is antecedently probable<lb/>
and, I should think, would certainly justify the investigation of the<lb/>
question--as much so as our knowledge of the correspondence between<lb/>
the biology of some species of domestic mosquito and the epidemiology<lb/>
of yellow fever justified the investigation of that problem.</p>
<p>In one thing, however, I think you have erred--in requesting that<lb/>
this investigation be done by yourself. This is a matter, of course,<lb/>
for the Bureau to determine and while--if undertaken--you, naturally,<lb/>
would be considered as an investigator--or among the investigators--<lb/>
the Bureau should pick out for that purpose the man whom it believes<lb/>
the best suited to make the investigation.</p>
<p>Paragraph 9 (on Page 2 of your first letter):--I am inclined to<lb/>
think that a virulently infected flea is apt to live a short time any-<lb/>
way. It is claimed that the developement of the plague bacilli in<lb/>
their intestines makes an absolute stoppage, so that they are able to<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00925012"/>
2.<lb/>
able to<lb/>
suck more blood only after expelling their stomach contents through<lb/>
the probosis--hence their virulence. I should think they would starve<lb/>
rather soon.</p>
<p>By the way, do you know whether fleas hibernate as flea or as egg,<lb/>
as the Stegomyia mosquito does? If the latter, the infection in them<lb/>
could not last through the winter and while chronic plague in rats is not<lb/>
uncommon in hot countries, it is septicemic--or at least if so, is very<lb/>
rarely so, being confined to the seats of old buboes.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think the investigation is very well worth making, as it<lb/>
may lead to <unclear>an</unclear> enormous saving in our Quarantine expenditure.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to think of Randall being a big boy. He was a-<lb/>
bout the size and general appearance of a &ldquo;bunny rabbit&rdquo; in his white<lb/>
woolen suit, when he was squatting about the lawn in Baltimore. Re-<lb/>
member me to him: his Mother and also to &ldquo;Miss Robertson,&rdquo; whom you<lb/>
did not even mention. Remember me also to Louis Williams: Dr. Ennion<lb/>
Williams and Drs. Flannagan and Brumfield.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
<signed>Assistant Surgeon General</signed>.
