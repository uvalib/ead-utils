<salute>Dear Ma:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The one absorbing topic of interest<lb/>
just now in N. O. is the weather - 4 1/2 inches of rain fell<lb/>
in 1 1/2 hours Wednesday &amp; simply flooded things<lb/>
As 9 3/4 inches fell in one storm in April/83, when<lb/>
I was here, it isn't so much a matter of surprise<lb/>
However there was no ground visible from La fay-<lb/>
ette square to La,' Avenue - (above the car stables)<lb/>
about 3 miles &amp; in the back of the town - every<lb/>
thing was over flowed. Water from 1 to 3 feet deep<lb/>
up Camp &amp; Magazine streets &amp; running like<lb/>
a mill race, - it has been raining a good deal<lb/>
ever since - also Monday &amp; Tuesday. It has ruin-<lb/>
ed all ripening figs &amp; melons <add>(water &amp; cantelopes)</add> - of which we had<lb/>
no end- If it stops we will have 1/4 of a crop<lb/>
left. We are <hi>grieved</hi> about the figs, - with milk<lb/>
they are better than peaches &amp; require no sugar, raw<lb/>
about as good as the <hi>average</hi> soft peach-very nourishing &amp; L.' Jr.<lb/>
&amp; Sr. very fond of them &amp; they are very wholesome.</p>

<p>Saturday week at 3.50 P. M. I rec'd a telegram &ldquo;to send<lb/>
all available tents &rdquo;to Tampa Fla&rdquo; &amp; I started to pack<lb/>
them up at 4. P. M &amp; had 690 tents, &amp; the full<lb/>
complement of poles pins &amp;c ready for shipment<lb/>
by Sunday night. Could not, ship until Monday<lb/>
because the Express Co would not receive them Sunday,<lb/>
I shipped them in the rain Monday &amp; Tuesday morning<lb/>
(10, 3 horse float loads) &amp; don't think I ever had a<lb/>
more annoying job. Tell Aunt May I kept the <hi>childrens</hi> <add>tent</add><lb/>
as I had only <hi>420</hi> on my Property Roll I could do so, also it has a hole in it<lb/>
We also had <hi>fire</hi> June <hi>30</hi> &amp; there has been no single<lb/>
hot night yet. Also the rains will make the city healthier.</p>
<p>My new steward will I think be satisfactory- I will<lb/>
probably have a little (not much) more work &amp; about 3/4 less<lb/>
annoyance than with Mr. Richardson. He is unmarried<lb/>
but I think intends &ldquo;to change all that&rdquo; in the fall<lb/>
&ldquo;Maguire&rdquo; - a Baltimorean. Both L. &amp; I keep well also the<lb/>
children - one doesn't feel as he does in Amherst, but well enough.<lb/>
Tell May that our <unclear>bathire</unclear> has gained from 20 to 100 feet <add>(in different places)</add> which<lb/>
will require a lengthening of our pipes to a corresponding<lb/>
amount.</p>
<p>We have taken a few in Trinity regularly now.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Chas. yesterday. We can tell nothing about how he<lb/>
is getting on. I think better - Also one from Jno. Dox, he will hardly<lb/>
recover I fear: &amp; I hardly know how to answer him. I am offered<lb/>
a share in a practice in <unclear>Cairo</unclear> (1/2 of what is <hi>said to</hi> a $5000 to $6000, prac-<lb/>
tice) &amp; have written for details. I do not think that I will accept, being<lb/>
timid about ventures now. I hope in a little while 18 mos to get $2500, &amp; rent &amp;c<lb/>
Wish I had had such a chance <unclear>4</unclear> years ago, give my love to all<lb/>
&amp; give me all the news from Va.</p>
<p>A Dr. <hi><unclear>Montiero</unclear></hi> from <hi>Manchester</hi> Va: who seemed to have met Hill &amp; indeed<lb/>
everybody else I every knew in Va: He is a queer old fellow. Although I liked him<lb/>
<unclear>Is</unclear> at Ship Island, staid 4 1/2 days with us.</p>
