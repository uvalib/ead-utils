<pb n="1" id="f02628040"/>
<p>from appendicitis, November 23, 1902,<lb/>
at the age of 51. At the time of his<lb/>
death the Secretary of War had said<lb/>
in his report, which was then in<lb/>
press but not yet given out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brilliant character of<lb/>
this scientific achievement, its<lb/>
inestimable value to mankind, the<lb/>
saving of thousands of lives, and<lb/>
the deliverance of the Atlantic<lb/>
Sea Coast from constant apprehen-<lb/>
sion, demand special recognition<lb/>
from the Government of the United<lb/>
States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Reed is the ranking Major<lb/>
in the Medical Department, and<lb/>
within a few months will, by op-<lb/>
eration of law, become Lieutenant-<lb/>
Colonel. I ask that the President<lb/>
be authorized to appoint him As-<lb/>
sistant Surgeon-General with the<lb/>
rank of Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Leonard Wood said of<lb/>
him in an address delivered at a me-<lb/>
morial meeting of scientific men in<lb/>
Washington, D. C., shortly after his<lb/>
death:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of no other man on this<lb/>
side of the world who has done so<lb/>
much for humanity as Dr. Reed.<lb/>
His discovery results in the sav-<lb/>
ing of more lives annually than<lb/>
were lost in the Cuban war, and<lb/>
saves the commercial interests of<lb/>
the world a greater financial loss<lb/>
each year than the cost of the<lb/>
Cuban war. He came to Cuba at a<lb/>
time when one-third of the officers<lb/>
of my staff died of yellow fever,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02628041"/>
and we were discouraged at the fail-<lb/>
ure of our efforts to control the<lb/>
disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the months when the disease<lb/>
was ordinarily worst the disease was<lb/>
checked and driven from Havana.<lb/>
That was the first time in nearly<lb/>
two hundred years that the city had<lb/>
been rid of it. The value of his<lb/>
discovery cannot be appreciated by<lb/>
persons who are not familiar with<lb/>
the conditions of tropical countries.<lb/>
Hereafter it will never be possible<lb/>
for yellow fever to gain such head-<lb/>
way that quarantine will exist from<lb/>
the mouth of the Potomac to the<lb/>
mouth of the Rio Grande. Future gen-<lb/>
erations will appreciate fully the<lb/>
value of Dr. Reed's services. His<lb/>
was the originating, directing and<lb/>
controlling mind in this work, and<lb/>
the others were assistants only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a letter from Prof. Welch to<lb/>
the Secretary of War, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Reed's researches in yellow<lb/>
fever are by far the most important<lb/>
contributions to science which<lb/>
have ever come from any Army sur-<lb/>
geon. In my judgment they are the<lb/>
most valuable contributions to med-<lb/>
icine and public hygiene which<lb/>
have ever been made in this coun-<lb/>
try with the exception of the dis-<lb/>
covery of anaesthesia. They have<lb/>
led and will lead to the saving<lb/>
of thousands of lives. I am in a<lb/>
position to know that the credit<lb/>
for the original ideas embodied in<lb/>
this work belongs wholly to Major<lb/>
Reed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prof. Welch was Dr. Reed's<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02628042"/>
teacher in Bacteriology and was his<lb/>
intimate and confidential friend<lb/>
with whom he consulted about the<lb/>
details of the work in Cuba.</p>
<p>A bill prepared in this office<lb/>
for a pension for his widow, equal<lb/>
in amount to his monthly pay was<lb/>
passed, but the amount was so cut<lb/>
down that while it keeps the wolf<lb/>
from the door it does not provide<lb/>
an adequate and comfortable income.<lb/>
It is not probable, however, that<lb/>
Congress would increase this pension<lb/>
and an effort has been made to sup-<lb/>
plement it by raising of a fund of<lb/>
$25,000 by the Walter Reed Memorial<lb/>
Association, incorporated for this<lb/>
purpose in the District of Columbia.<lb/>
The interest on this fund will be<lb/>
given Mrs. Reed during her lifetime<lb/>
and the principal after her death<lb/>
will be devoted to some form of me-<lb/>
morial. This fund lacks at present<lb/>
about $6,000. of completion. The<lb/>
existence of this association,<lb/>
should its hopes be attained, does<lb/>
not, however, absolve the Nation<lb/>
from the obligation of a fitting<lb/>
recognition for this great work, and<lb/>
it is the opinion of the undersigned<lb/>
which it is believed is shared by<lb/>
the vast majority of physicians in<lb/>
the United States, that Congress<lb/>
should erect a statue to Walter<lb/>
Reed in Washington. The assistance<lb/>
of the President in inducing Con-<lb/>
gress to do so is requested.</p>
<p>The second number of the Commis-<lb/>
sion was Dr. James Carroll, at that<lb/>
time Acting Assistant Surgeon, U.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02628043"/>
S. Army.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll is now 52 years old.<lb/>
He entered the military service<lb/>
June 9, 1874, and served as Private,<lb/>
Corporal, Sergeant and Hospital<lb/>
Steward from that date to May 21,<lb/>
1898, when he was appointed Acting<lb/>
Assistant Surgeon General. He was<lb/>
appointed First Lieutenant and As-<lb/>
sistant Surgeon in the Medical Corps,<lb/>
October 27, 1902, which rank he still<lb/>
holds.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll was Dr. Reed's truest<lb/>
assistant and coadjutor from the in-<lb/>
ception of the work which resulted<lb/>
in the discovery of the method of<lb/>
propagation of yellow fever. As sta-<lb/>
ted above, the third series of exper-<lb/>
iments were performed by Dr. Carroll<lb/>
alone, Dr. Reed having been refused<lb/>
permission to return to Cuba to com-<lb/>
plete his work.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll was the first exper-<lb/>
imental case of yellow fever, and he<lb/>
suffered a severe attack, to which<lb/>
he attributes a heart trouble from<lb/>
which he now suffers. At the time of<lb/>
undergoing this experiment he was<lb/>
46 years old, an age at which the<lb/>
risk from this disease is very great<lb/>
as its mortality rapidly increases<lb/>
with age of patient. He had at that<lb/>
time a wife and five children who<lb/>
had no other means of support except<lb/>
his pay as an Acting Assistant Sur-<lb/>
geon.</p>
<p>It is recommended that Congress<lb/>
be asked to pass a special Act pro-<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02628044"/>
moting Dr. Carroll, on account of<lb/>
his services in connection with<lb/>
this discovery and the courage<lb/>
shown by him in subjecting himself<lb/>
to experiment, to the rank of Lieu-<lb/>
tenant-Colonel, the number of Medi-<lb/>
cal Officers in that grade being in-<lb/>
creased by one for that purpose.<lb/>
Also his name and effigy should<lb/>
appear on the monument to Walter<lb/>
Reed.</p>
<p>Dr. Jesse W. Lazear was the third<lb/>
member of the Commission.</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear was a native of Balti-<lb/>
more and a graduate of Johns Hopkins<lb/>
University, afterwards getting his<lb/>
professional degree at Columbia Uni-<lb/>
versity and Bellevue. At the time<lb/>
he incurred his death in the course<lb/>
of these experiments, as above men-<lb/>
tioned, he was 34 years old. He<lb/>
left a wife and two young children,<lb/>
the younger a little son born a few<lb/>
months before his death, whom he<lb/>
never saw. Mrs. Lazear received<lb/>
from Congress a pension of $17. a<lb/>
a month with $2. additional for each<lb/>
of two minor children until they<lb/>
reach the age of sixteen. Also a<lb/>
battery in Baltimore Harbor was,<lb/>
by direction of the Secretary of War,<lb/>
named in his honor. It is believed<lb/>
that this recognition of the part of<lb/>
the Nation for his services is ut-<lb/>
terly inadequate. His widow's pen-<lb/>
sion should be increased to $100, a<lb/>
month, and steps should be taken to<lb/>
perpetuate his name in connection<lb/>
with the Walter Reed monument above<lb/>
suggested.</p>
<pb n="6" id="f02628045"/>
<p>Dr. A. Agramonte was the fourth<lb/>
member of the Yellow Fever Commis-<lb/>
sion. He was a Cuban by birth, an<lb/>
immune to yellow fever, and having<lb/>
been assigned other work, took no<lb/>
part in the first series of experi-<lb/>
ments with regard to the convey-<lb/>
ance of the disease by the mosquito,<lb/>
of which, in fact, he was not at the<lb/>
time cognizant. Being an immune, he<lb/>
ran no risk in connection with this<lb/>
work, and it is believed that his<lb/>
contributions to it have been suffi-<lb/>
ciently recognized in the associa-<lb/>
tion of his name with the other mem-<lb/>
bers of the Commission who brought<lb/>
about this great discovery.</p>
<p>Twenty-three of the men who sub-<lb/>
mitted themselves for experiment by<lb/>
the board, contracted yellow fever,<lb/>
beginning with Dr. James Carroll,<lb/>
who was taken sick August 31, 1900,<lb/>
and ending with John R. Bullard, who<lb/>
was taken sick October 23, 1901.</p>
<p>Conspicuous among them was John<lb/>
J. Moran, a civilian clerk employed<lb/>
at the headquarters of General Fitz-<lb/>
hugh Lee, at Quemados, who was one of<lb/>
the earliest volunteers for the sec-<lb/>
ond set of experiments, and whose<lb/>
action was dictated by the purest<lb/>
motives of altruism and self-devotion.<lb/>
Mr. Moran disclaimed, before submitt-<lb/>
ing to the experiments, any desire<lb/>
for reward, and has never accepted<lb/>
any since, although he was offered<lb/>
the $200. which the liberality of the<lb/>
Military Governor enabled the Commis-<lb/>
sion to give to each experimental<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02628046"/>
patient, the members of the board<lb/>
excepted. Such was his modesty<lb/>
that he has made no effort, so far<lb/>
as known to this office, to make<lb/>
known his connection with these ex-<lb/>
periments and reap the credit which<lb/>
is so justly due him. Mr. Moran<lb/>
was a native of Ohio. His present<lb/>
address is not known to this office.<lb/>
The first inoculations in the case<lb/>
of Mr. Moran were for some reasons<lb/>
unsuccessful, on November 26th and<lb/>
29th. He did not suffer an attack<lb/>
until after the third inoculation<lb/>
on December 21st.</p>
<p>The same remarks apply to the<lb/>
first experimental case of the sec-<lb/>
ond set, Private John R. Kissinger,<lb/>
Hospital Corps, who volunteered at<lb/>
the same time with Mr. Moran and e-<lb/>
qually disclaimed any desire for re-<lb/>
ward.</p>
<p>Private Kissinger did not leave<lb/>
Cuba immediately after the experi-<lb/>
ments as did Mr. Moran, and there-<lb/>
fore the military authorities were<lb/>
able to reward him in some measure<lb/>
along with other enlisted men who<lb/>
volunteered for these experiments.<lb/>
He was promoted Acting Hospital Stew-<lb/>
ard, presented with a gold watch by<lb/>
the Chief Surgeon of the Department<lb/>
in the presence of all the Medical<lb/>
Officers and Hospital Corps men on<lb/>
duty at Columbia Barracks, and also<lb/>
received a present of $115. in cash.<lb/>
He took his discharge November 14,<lb/>
1901, and has since (on December 17,<lb/>
1903) made application for pension.<lb/>
This was refused for lack of evidence<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02628047"/>
that his ill-health was incident to<lb/>
the service.</p>
<p>Of the other experimental cases,<lb/>
seven were Spanish immigrants who<lb/>
submitted to experiment purely for<lb/>
the money which they were promised.<lb/>
With regard to those who were Amer-<lb/>
ican soldiers, however, ten in num-<lb/>
ber in addition to those already men-<lb/>
tioned, it cannot be doubted that,<lb/>
although they received pecuniary re-<lb/>
wards, a desire to assist in what<lb/>
they appreciated was a great and glo-<lb/>
rious work together with a spirit of<lb/>
adventure, was the most powerful mo-<lb/>
tive. The same is true of the last<lb/>
experimental case, Mr. John R. Bul-<lb/>
lard, a graduate of Harvard where he<lb/>
was a distinguished athlete and cap-<lb/>
tain of the University crew. The<lb/>
names of these men with the dates of<lb/>
their attack is appended with this<lb/>
report.</p>
<p>It remains to mention Dr. Robert<lb/>
P. Cook. Acting Assistant Surgeon,<lb/>
and the six Privates of the Hospital<lb/>
Corps who were for twenty nights<lb/>
shut up in the infected bedding<lb/>
house at Camp Lazear. These experi-<lb/>
ments, which were absolutely neces-<lb/>
sary to demonstrate that yellow fe-<lb/>
ver could not be carried otherwise<lb/>
than by the mosquito, had for these<lb/>
men, so far as they knew, an equal<lb/>
element of danger with the other<lb/>
experiments and had in addition such<lb/>
repulsive and disagreeable features<lb/>
as to test to the full their hardi-<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02628048"/>
hood and patience. Much of the bed-<lb/>
ding upon which they slept and which<lb/>
they were required daily to handle,<lb/>
was so soiled with the discharges of<lb/>
the sick as to be very repulsive to<lb/>
the nose and eye, and the last experi-<lb/>
mentors actually slept in the pajamas<lb/>
and sheets which had been worn by se-<lb/>
vere cases of yellow fever. The names<lb/>
of these men are appended to the list<lb/>
given below of experimental cases of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>It will be observed that three of<lb/>
these men -- Folk, Jernegan and<lb/>
Hanberry -- afterwards submitted to<lb/>
the mosquito inoculation or blood<lb/>
injection in order to demonstrate<lb/>
their non-immunity at the time of the<lb/>
first experiment.</p>
<p>It is believed that the names of<lb/>
all the Americans on this list should<lb/>
be placed on a tablet in connection<lb/>
with the monument to Walter Reed.</p>
<p>From the foregoing it will be<lb/>
seen that the total disbursements of<lb/>
this great nation in the way of re-<lb/>
wards for those who made possible this<lb/>
discovery, and their families, amounts<lb/>
to $146. a month. As to its value to<lb/>
the American people attention is in-<lb/>
vited to the quotations from General<lb/>
Wood and Prof. Welch given above, and<lb/>
others given in the enclosed circulars<lb/>
published by the Walter Reed Memorial<lb/>
Association.</p>
<p>How discreditable appears this<lb/>
niggardly provision when compared with<lb/>
the action of the English Government<lb/>
which more than a century ago, when<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02628049"/>
the purchasing power of money was<lb/>
far greater than at present, gave<lb/>
to Jenner, the discoverer of vacci-<lb/>
nation grants amounting to 30,000<lb/>
pounds sterling. He also received<lb/>
from a subscription in India 7383<lb/>
pounds sterling, while the Reed Memo-<lb/>
rial has so far succeeded in raising<lb/>
only a little over half that sum.</p>
<p>It is believed that if the Presi-<lb/>
dent would exert his great personal<lb/>
influence in furtherance of the aims<lb/>
of that association its task would be<lb/>
soon completed.</p>
