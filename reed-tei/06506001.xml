<p><hi>THE SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS IN CUBA IN 1900-1901 BY THE WALTER REED<lb/>
BOARD WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE COST OF THE EXPERIMENTS TO THE<lb/>
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.</hi></p>
<p>The Secretary of War, Hon. Elihu Root, in his annual report, 1902,<lb/>
said with reference to the conquest of yellow fever in Cuba in<lb/>
1900-1901, as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brilliant character of this scientific achievement,<lb/>
its inestimable value to mankind, the saving of thousands<lb/>
of lives, and the deliverance of the Atlantic seacoast<lb/>
from constant apprehension, demand special recognition<lb/>
from the Government of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Congress had, in concurrence with his opinion, by an act<lb/>
approved February 28, 1929, authorized and directed the Secretary<lb/>
of War to publish annually in the Army Register a Roll of Honor<lb/>
on which shall be carried the following names, and to define in<lb/>
the yellow fever investigation in Cuba. The same act provided<lb/>
that a gold medal be presented to each person named in the roll,<lb/>
or to the representatives of those who died.</p>
<p>The law incorporated on the Roll of Honor the names of all of<lb/>
the volunteers so that it would not be possible for other claimants<lb/>
to receive consideration as a volunteer since there could be no<lb/>
other available written proof. After this law was passed, many<lb/>
men who were in Cuba at the time and who actually worked with the<lb/>
Reed Board have tried to be placed on the Roll of Honor. All<lb/>
have failed however since none could produce the necessary<lb/>
evidence that he had volunteered or that he had taken the<lb/>
hazardous tests.</p>

<p><hi>MY PROBLEM: HOW MUCH DID THE REED BOARD SPEND IN ACCOMPLISHING<lb/>
THE EXPERIMENT ON THE TRANSMISSION OF YELLOW FEVER BY MOSQUITOES</hi>?</p>
<p>This &ldquo;puzzle&rdquo; was put to me by Dr. Philip S. Hench and from the<lb/>
data available to me, I could not have written a very valuable<lb/>
cost analysis of this great experiment. However, when Dr. Hench<lb/>
sent me a synopsis of the information on the stubs of the check-<lb/>
book used to disburse the funds which General Wood had allotted<lb/>
for gratuities and other expenses at Camp Lazear, it was a delight<lb/>
to me to work out this little &ldquo;puzzle&rdquo;. Dr. Hench thought that<lb/>
my knowledge of the men whom I had recommended to Major Reed for<lb/>
various duties at Camp Lazear would help to unravel some of the<lb/>
meager details on the stubs of the checkbook. And so it turned<lb/>
out to be. The brief notations on the stubs contain a wealth<lb/>
of information that will add much to Dr. Hench's great collection<lb/>
of facts. He has been pursuing data of this kind for twelve or<lb/>
fifteen years. It has been a great privilege for me to work with<lb/>
him and to suggest places where original data might be found<lb/>
after fifty years. I hope that my efforts are pleasing to my<lb/>
friend, the fact-finding, medical historian.</p>
<p>I shall first submit my draft of this effort to Mr. Paul L. Tate<lb/>
of Berkeley, California, for his criticism and help in untangling<lb/>
anything in the &ldquo;puzzle&rdquo; which he may discover as desirable.<lb/>
Mr. Tate was one of the efficient hospital clerks at the Columbia<lb/>
Barracks Hospital at the time Walter Reed was there conducting<lb/>
the yellow fever experiments. His help will add much to my<lb/>
efforts. Some of the figures herein will be absolutely correct<lb/>
due to the factual data from the checkbook; but others, will<lb/>
have to be estimated. With Mr. Tate's help, we should be quite<lb/>
accurate in our estimates since we know from the checkbook the<lb/>
costs of supplies and labor in Cuba in 1900.</p>
<p>The Governor General's allotment for this experiment was $10,000.<lb/>
The Chief Surgeon of the Department of Western Cuba, Major<lb/>
Jefferson Randolph Kean, was made custodian of the fund. In<lb/>
November, 1900, he promptly opened an account with the North<lb/>
American Trust Company and deposited $5,000. Construction of<lb/>
two small buildings was begun on November 10 (Buildings No. 1<lb/>
and No. 2) and checks in payment for building materials, labor,<lb/>
etc. were made out late in November and early December.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f06506004"/>
<p>- 3 -</p>
<p>Camp Lazear was opened on November 20, 1900. The enlisted men from<lb/>
our Hospital Detachment, according to orders from Headquarters,<lb/>
reported to Major Reed for duty. They immediately pitched hospital<lb/>
tents over the floors which had been placed on the three sites<lb/>
selected by Reed.</p>
<p>Camp Lazear had a Headquarters Section of about 10 tents and there<lb/>
the men were placed in quarantine before taking the tests. Acting<lb/>
Hospital Steward Claude M. Cook, an immune, was placed in charge of<lb/>
the quarantine matters. He was a most efficient and faithful non-<lb/>
commissioned officer. He had become an immune from an attack of<lb/>
yellow fever when at Guanajay in July, 1900, while I was in command<lb/>
of that Hospital. Cook had two or three immune enlisted men to help<lb/>
him in this work. Major Reed, in his Baltimore address, had this to<lb/>
say of the men of this detachment (Senate Document, page 97.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Placed in an open field, which was fairly swept at all times by<lb/>
the prevalent winds, and having a military garrison each of whose<lb/>
members had been personally selected by reason of former good con-<lb/>
duct and interest in the work to be here undertaken, no difficulty<lb/>
whatever was experienced in maintaining the strictest quarantine<lb/>
against the outside&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have always been proud of those men who endured the hardships of<lb/>
the early days of the Spanish American War and then later passed<lb/>
through the yellow fever epidemics of Quemados and Havana in 1900.<lb/>
It is most gratifying to have the opportunity of noting that Major<lb/>
Reed found them efficient and heroic also.</p>
<p>Besides the Headquarters Section, the main part of Camp Lazear, there<lb/>
were also two small, specially constructed buildings, as described in<lb/>
Senate Document, pg. 97. These buildings were about 75 yards from<lb/>
the main camp and 80 yards from each other on opposite slopes of a<lb/>
small valley. Building No. 1 was the &ldquo;fomite&rdquo; building and Building<lb/>
No. 2 was known as the &ldquo;infected mosquito&rdquo; building. Near by the<lb/>
&ldquo;fomite&rdquo; building was a tent where the occupants could get fresh<lb/>
air in the daytime and also make up for sleep lost at night in the<lb/>
foul surroundings and bad ventilation of the &ldquo;fomite&rdquo; building.</p>
<p>The list of names of the heroic volunteers on pages 1 and 2 of this<lb/>
paper does not include the individual citations in order that we may<lb/>
display after each name the actual entries from the checkbook just as<lb/>
they occurred at Camp Lazear in 1900-1901, and each test with dates<lb/>
and results. On the Roll of Honor, the names appear alphabetically<lb/>
while here the names are listed chronologically. (See pages 10-14.)<lb/>
Here then, are the actual facts just as they were recorded at the<lb/>
time they occurred, over 50 years ago. These unique entries in the<lb/>
checkbook will, I think, be of much interest. Reed's careful planning<lb/>
and the help he received from the Governor General in the way of<lb/>
advice, encouragement, and funds, were of primary importance in solv-<lb/>
ing these experiments.</p>
<p>That the Board fully appreciated this timely help is fully acknowledged<lb/>
by Reed in the Board's &ldquo;Additional Note&rdquo;: &ldquo;We desire to here express<lb/>
our sincere thanks to the Military Governor of the island of Cuba,<lb/>
Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood, United States Volunteers, without whose<lb/>
approval and assistance these observations could not have been carried<lb/>
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From here on quotations from the stubs will be grouped together and<lb/>
comment made as to my interpretations of anything which is not clear.</p>

<p><hi>THE SPANISH IMMIGRANTS</hi></p>
<p>Early in November, 1900, a large ship from Spain came to Havana<lb/>
with many young Spaniards who wanted to settle in Cuba. Reed<lb/>
became interested at once with the idea that this might be an<lb/>
opportunity to convince the young men that this would prove to<lb/>
be a favorable chance to become immune, and also add to their<lb/>
funds by volunteering to take a mosquito bite. Reed promptly<lb/>
consulted General Wood who conferred with the Spanish Consul.<lb/>
He gave his approval of this idea if his countrymen were of<lb/>
legal age.</p>
<p>Note check no. 16 in which F. Argilagos was paid for contracting<lb/>
for Spanish labor (subjects for experiments) and check no. 19 to<lb/>
Dr. Agramonte for $11.89 for immigration dues and transportation<lb/>
for 8 men.</p>
<p>The Kean checkbook has been of great assistance, especially in<lb/>
determining the importance of the part played by the few faithful<lb/>
immigrants who remained at the Camp to the end. Four out of five<lb/>
of them contracted yellow fever and they all took part in several<lb/>
minor but important tests. There has been very little publicity<lb/>
about them or what they did. The Senate Document (No. 822) gives<lb/>
a few of their names and has a very incomplete record of some of<lb/>
their tests. I have seen very little information regarding them,<lb/>
even their names were rarely used. But here in this small check-<lb/>
book are all their names, the amounts paid them and dates. One<lb/>
error is, however, evident as Jose Martinez is shown by the Table,<lb/>
Page 104, Senate Document No. 887, to have taken the (mosquito)<lb/>
test on January 3, 1901, but there is no record of any payment of<lb/>
his $200 for contracting yellow fever. There is, however, a record<lb/>
of the payment of $50 to Martinez for another test. I believe the<lb/>
check for <hi>Jose</hi> Fernandez, No. 48 for $200, was for <hi>Jose</hi> Martinez<lb/>
and that the error was promptly corrected locally. I find that the<lb/>
name of Jose Fernandez does not appear as having taken any test<lb/>
but that <hi>Nicomar</hi> Fernandez took the mosquito test and received his<lb/>
$200 (See check no. 25, Dec. 26.)</p>
<p>One of the most interesting of the minor tests in which the Spaniards<lb/>
participated is disclosed by the checkbook. This makes clear the<lb/>
incomplete record in the footnote, Page 82, Senate Document No. 887.</p>
<p>In this very interesting test, Kissinger, Moran, Jose Martinez, and<lb/>
Antonio Benigno were the &ldquo;controls&rdquo;. The blood was obtained from an<lb/>
experimental case (Andrus) whose disease was in turn produced by the<lb/>
injection of 5 c.c. of blood derived from a non-experimental case of<lb/>
yellow fever. The &ldquo;controls&rdquo; had taken the mosquito tests in December<lb/>
at Camp Lazear and all had yellow fever and were treated by Dr. Ames.<lb/>
They &ldquo;were also injected sub-cutaneously with 1 c.c. of the same blood<lb/>
without manifesting any symptoms whatever. Martinez and Benigno were<lb/>
given checks for $50 each (check nos. 59 and 60) for taking this test.</p>

<p><hi>Comments</hi>: In Table VII, Presedo, Benigno, N. Fernandez, and Jose<lb/>
Martinez were the ones who took the test which produced yellow<lb/>
fever, and they should all have received $200. In the checkbook,<lb/>
however, <hi>Jose</hi> Fernandez is shown as having received $200 which<lb/>
should have gone to <hi>Jose</hi> Martinez. I have therefore removed the<lb/>
name of Jose Fernandez from this Table and left it in the complete<lb/>
record of all original entries on the stubs on that paper. Jose<lb/>
Fuente who received $114 for &ldquo;personal experiment&rdquo; was the<lb/>
Spaniard who took the complete test but it was <unclear>probably</unclear> negative<lb/>
and he would therefore get but $100 for that and $14 for labor.<lb/>
Walter Reed was not impressed with the reliability of the immi-<lb/>
grants who at first came to the camp as so many of them left him<lb/>
without paying any attention to their agreement, but as has been<lb/>
shown here, the ones who had started the tests were most reliable,<lb/>
valuable as well as brave. It is not known whether they were<lb/>
given a written statement of the agreement, which probably promised<lb/>
to give each one of them $200 for taking the infected mosquito bite,<lb/>
provided it produced yellow fever, or $100 if they took the test<lb/>
and it was <hi>negative</hi>, i.e., because he was immune. Besides the<lb/>
rewards, they received their subsistence and shelter at the Camp.</p>

<p><hi>Comment</hi>: The men listed above were nearly all volunteers assigned<lb/>
to the camp by Department orders. They were assigned to special<lb/>
duties such as ambulance driver, guards in charge of the men who<lb/>
were quarantined before their tests, cooks, etc. For these<lb/>
services they were paid small sums as shown above. This improved<lb/>
morale, kept the men busy, and in general produced splendid results.<lb/>
Men, qualified along certain lines, such as clerks, were paid<lb/>
accordingly, but the most of them received 50 cents per day.<lb/>
Quarantine duty was especially important as shown in the Board's<lb/>
&ldquo;additional note.&rdquo; Lambert probably assisted Dr. Ames at the<lb/>
Camp in some way before yellow fever cases required him at the<lb/>
hospital. McConnell was an artist from the S.G.O. who was sent<lb/>
to make sketches of Aedes mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Besides the men listed above, Acting Steward Burton was the non-<lb/>
commissioned officer who was in charge while the Camp was under<lb/>
construction. Also Dr. Roger P. Ames was at Camp Headquarters in<lb/>
general charge when Reed was not there. He had an assistant, Con-<lb/>
tract Surgeon _ _ Masouri (?) who remained at Columbia Barracks<lb/>
Hospital where he assisted Ames in the care of the sick yellow fever<lb/>
patients. On one or two serious cases, female nurses were employed<lb/>
at Columbia Barracks Hospital, but usually Ames preferred to have<lb/>
Lambert and his men do the nursing.</p>

<p><hi>The Tests at Columbia Barracks in August and September, 1900</hi>.</p>
<p>By August 1900, the Board had finished its work on the Sanarelli's<lb/>
organism and Lazear started his work on Dr. Finlay's Mosquito Theory.<lb/>
Major Reed was suddenly called to Washington to help Dr. Victor<lb/>
Vaughan close up their volumnious report on typhoid fever. Carroll<lb/>
was working on his assigned duties, the intestinal flora.</p>
<p>On August 11, Dr. Lazear started his inoculations with two cases,<lb/>
two more on August 12, and so on until on August 31, Dr. Carroll<lb/>
who had been bitten with <hi>one</hi> of Lazear's mosquitoes on the <unclear>w25th</unclear><lb/>
of August suddenly developed a severe case of yellow fever. This<lb/>
sudden and quite unexpected event resulted in the following three<lb/>
cases, probably all experimental, of the Board's Preliminary Report,<lb/>

<item>3. <hi>Lazear, Jesse W.</hi> Was bitten by a mosquito about the middle of<lb/>
September, 1900. He developed a severe case of yellow fever and<lb/>
died on September 25th, the only fatality in these experiments.<lb/>
It was the consensus of opinion among the doctors at the Hospital<lb/>
that Lazear infected himself with one of his own mosquitoes and<lb/>
thereby kept his agreement with Reed and the other non-immune<lb/>
members of the Board, just as Carroll had done, i.e., took the test.</item>
</list></p>
<p><hi>Camp Lazear Organized.</hi></p>
<p>So, on November 20, 1900, Camp Lazear was opened and experiments<lb/>
promptly began.</p>
<p>A fund of $10,000 was authorized by Governor General Wood to pay<lb/>
gratuities and to meet the other necessary expenses. Major Kean,<lb/>
the Chief Surgeon of the Department, was made Custodian. He promptly<lb/>
opened a checking account with the North American Trust Company in<lb/>
Havana. The first checks were drawn on November 24, 1900. By<lb/>
December 26, it became necessary to decide how the gratuities should<lb/>
be given out and to whom.</p>
<p>It was quite clear by that date that fomites played no part in the<lb/>
transmission of yellow fever. Therefore, the first checks were<lb/>
drawn on that date paying Kissinger, who was then convalescent from<lb/>
mosquito-borne yellow fever, <hi>the first experimental case at Camp<lb/>
Lazear</hi>.</p>
<p>Dr. Cooke and the two other men were released from confinement in<lb/>
their foul surroundings in the infected bedding building at about<lb/>
the same time, without contracting yellow fever, and their gratuities<lb/>
had to be decided upon. The fomite test now was reduced 50 percent<lb/>
for that hazard, while the mosquito test increased in value. Dr. Cooke<lb/>
refused his gratuity but all of the other men accepted their $100<lb/>
reward for a very trying ordeal.</p>
<p>It was most fortunate that General Kean had preserved the checkbook<lb/>
with its stubs and recently had transferred it to Dr. Hench for<lb/>
permanently placing it with other valuable documents of this fascin-<lb/>
ating story of the yellow fever episode. The stubs contain informa-<lb/>
tion of much value which will be carefully studied by historians.<lb/>
From this book, it is now clear to me how the gratuities were awarded<lb/>
as heretofore very little was definitely known about this matter.<lb/>
It seems now from various notations on the stubs that there was<lb/>
hesitation in Reed's mind about saying much about the tests since<lb/>
General Wood and the Board had been severely attacked by some Havana<lb/>
newspapers about the use of human beings in such experiments. Now<lb/>
there need be no such hesitation as so much good news followed<lb/>
skepticism.</p>
<pb n="14" id="f06506014"/>
<p>- 12 -</p>
<p>On December 26, Kissinger received his check for $150 - and on<lb/>
the same day another for $50 - thus making his total for the<lb/>
test $200. Did Kean and Reed decide at that time to raise the<lb/>
gratuity to the same amount as had been offered to the Spaniards?<lb/>
I think so.</p>
<p>The remark on Kean's check stub was &ldquo;for service&rdquo;. After that,<lb/>
the remarks were changed to &ldquo;Personal Experiment&rdquo; or to &ldquo;Personal<lb/>
Service&rdquo;. The checks for labor were so marked or the kind of<lb/>
labor performed as specified, such as &ldquo;cook&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was also decided that the volunteer who took the mosquito test<lb/>
(or blood injection test) and did <hi>not</hi> contract yellow fever should<lb/>
receive but one-half of the gratuity, or $100.</p>
<p>In Table IX I have used the term &ldquo;gratuities&rdquo; to avoid confusion.<lb/>
The original wording is shown elsewhere.</p>

<p>Springer was an all round good man that I knew very well and I<lb/>

some test such as Hospital Steward Neate took, viz. a bite by a<lb/>
culex pungens that had been fed on a case of yellow fever. I<lb/>
think that Major Reed felt that he must confirm Neate's experi-<lb/>
ment, and therefore selected Springer.</p>

</table></p>
<p>The expenses in establishing Camp Lazear and running it under strict<lb/>
quarantine regulations required quite a large personnel and increased<lb/>
expenses in many ways that were not required in the well-established<lb/>
Hospital at Columbia Barracks. Hence in estimating the cost of the<lb/>
three cases at Columbia Barracks in August and September 1900, we<lb/>
can eliminate practically everything but the care of the sick and<lb/>
minor incidental expenses. In my estimation, $300 would amply<lb/>
cover everything including funeral expenses of Dr. Lazear and the<lb/>
later reburial at Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
<p>Comparing this estimate with the cost of $564 for 3 cases at<lb/>
Camp Lazear, I believe that $300 is a far more logical figure<lb/>
and would be ample.</p>
<p>The three cases at Columbia Barracks Hospital in October, 1901, were<lb/>
treated at one time by Dr. Carroll under the very simple and<lb/>
perfect conditions of that well-established hospital. No compli-<lb/>
cations arose and all three patients recovered promptly. My<lb/>
estimate of $200 would probably be too high.</p>
<p>Comparing this estimate with the cost of $564 for 3 cases at Camp<lb/>
Lazear, I believe that $200 would still be too high. However, I<lb/>
think it would be reasonable to use this figure as it is certainly<lb/>
not far from the exact cost.</p>
<p>In the above estimates gratuities were not considered as none was<lb/>
granted in the 6 cases at Columbia Barracks. If it is desired to<lb/>
include gratuities it would be a simple matter to do so. Therefore,<lb/>
the total cost of all the Reed Board's experiments without gratuities<lb/>
was $3,508.</p>
