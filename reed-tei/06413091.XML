<p>Kean feels Moran is too contentious about the Cuban medical profession taking all the credit for the yellow fever discovery. Kean tells Hench the advice he gave Moran about how to approach his autobiography, or memoirs, without angering the Cubans.</p>

<p>I received about a week ago a<lb/>
letter from Moran inclosing a type<lb/>
written copy of the first two or three pages<lb/>
of his memoirs. There was really no<lb/>
biographical material in it, but it was<lb/>
a fierce attack on the Cuban medical<lb/>
profession for their partisan spirit in the<lb/>
matter of the respective merits of Findlay<lb/>
and Reed - Altho. he maintains that<lb/>
there should be a fair division <add>of</add> the credit,<lb/>
he does not mention that American doctors<lb/>
are not free from blame in their failure<lb/>
to give <del>any</del><add>sufficient</add> credit to Findlay - while<lb/>
what he says of the Havana doctors is quite<lb/>
true. Moran ignores the old french proverb:<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06413092"/>
2<lb/>
Toutes les v&eacute;rit&eacute;s ne sont pas bonnes &agrave; dire-<lb/>
His tone is too contentions to convert any one<lb/>
and would do more harm than good.</p>
<p>I pointed out to him the difference in meaning<lb/>
between memoir and memoirs. In the Singular<lb/>
it means an essay or treatise about one subject,<lb/>
whereas when one writes his memoirs the plural<lb/>
implies something biographical and longer.<lb/>
I told him that I hoped he would give us in a<lb/>
simple style, which is always the best, the story<lb/>
of his life; where he was born and the circum-<lb/>
stances of his bringing up, and his army service-<lb/>
Then when he got to the yellow fever episode<lb/>
he could describe that and his connection<lb/>
with it. Then he could naturally comment<lb/>
on the pity that a partisan spirit has arisen<lb/>
to warp the facts of medical history and substitute<lb/>
national prejudices to replace the judicial and<lb/>
scientific attitude of mind. I suggested that<lb/>
he should state the facts and let the reader<lb/>
draw his own conclusions. <hi>Entre nous</hi> I fear<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06413093"/>
3<lb/>
that we wont get much out of him. He<lb/>
hasn't the judicial type of mind. I told him<lb/>
that one fact should be stated as regards the<lb/>
work of the Reed Board: that Findlay had<lb/>
for ten years been announcing his theory<lb/>
with tongue and pen in both Spanish and<lb/>
English and had made only one convert, his<lb/>
disciple Delgado. Yet within a month after<lb/>
he had made his report of the Camp Lazear<lb/>
experiments the Findlay theory had been<lb/>
accepted by the medical profession of<lb/>
Havana and generally in the U.S.<lb/>
If the Cubans are told that it is enough,<lb/>
without any further discussion.</p>
<p>I know that you are interested in<lb/>
Moran's memoirs whether with or<lb/>
without the <hi>S</hi>, as I am too, but I think<lb/>
the time has not yet come to look<lb/>
around for a publisher.</p>
