<date value="1923-01-06">January 6, 1923.</date>
Surgeon L.D. Fricks,<lb/>
U.S. Public Health Service,<lb/>
Room 17 Court House Building,<lb/>
Memphis, Tennessee.<lb/>
Dear Dr. Fricks:</p>
<p>Colonel J.F. Siler of the Army Medical Corps rang <unclear>meuup</unclear><lb/>
yesterday saying that data were desired by the Senate committee<lb/>
showing an estimate of the cost of antimalaria operations at the<lb/>
Muscle Shoals project. For immediate information I referred him<lb/>
to Dr. Carter, who furnished certain data of requirements by the<lb/>
Federal Power Commission and the Public Health Service which could<lb/>
be used as a basis for calculating the cost. This material is in<lb/>
the hands of General L.H. Beach, Chief of Engineers, who is apparently<lb/>
responsible for making this estimate.</p>
<p>I told Colonel Siler over the 'phone that if it was de-<lb/>
sired we would endeavor to send an engineer to Muscle Shoals to make<lb/>
a rapid survey on which estimates could be based, and this morning<lb/>
he informed me that General Beach would prefer this means of arriv-<lb/>
ing at an estimate. I beleive, therefore, that it would be good policy<lb/>
for you to detail a man to make this survey which would include not<lb/>
only the cost incidental to construction, but some estimate of the<lb/>
annual upkeep.</p>
<p>I understand that General Beach is sending you a letter<lb/>
which may be used at Muscle Shoals to facilitate the investigation.</p>
<p>From the Service's standpoint, my reason for complying<lb/>
with the request for a survey is in order that opportunities for the<lb/>
investigation of impounded water problems may be more readily secured<lb/>
to the Service. The Army engineers apparently have no desire to deal<lb/>
with the malaria aspect of the project beyond conforming with such<lb/>
rules as it may be necessary to comply with.</p>
<p>Yours very truly,<lb/>
(A.M. Stimson)<lb/>
Assistant Surgeon General.<lb/>

Refer to file No. 120483<lb/>
Subject: Sanitary conditions surrounding pool abive Dam No. 2.<lb/>
To: The District Engineer,<lb/>
U.S. Engineer Office,<lb/>
FLORENCE, ALABAMA.</p>
<p>1. The Public Health Service is engaged in an effort to<lb/>
eradicate malaria in those parts of the country most subject to its<lb/>
ravages. It has done considerable work in Alabama and adjacent States<lb/>
The work of eradicating the mosquito in the pool at Dam No. 12 Coosa<lb/>
River, was under its direction.</p>
<p>2. It is quite desirable that steps be inaugurated at an<lb/>
early date to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes in the pool above<lb/>
Dam No. 2 which you are constructing. This office has been conferr-<lb/>
ing with the Public Health Service and informed that organization<lb/>
that we did not have funds available for the purpose of mosquito<lb/>
control. That the Service will endeavor to secure an appropriation<lb/>
from Congress for the purpose, and with the object of making an es-<lb/>
timate of the sum that will be needed, Surgeon L.D. Fricks of the U.S.<lb/>
Public Health Service, whose office is in the Court House at Memphis,<lb/>
Tenn., will send one or two doctors to Florence to look over the field<lb/>
and ascertain what the exact conditions are so that the required am-<lb/>
ount can be somewhat definitely determined.</p>
<p>3. You will give whoever will be sent by <unclear><del>the</del></unclear> Surgeon Fricks,<lb/>
all possible information and assist him in every way to obtain as<lb/>
complete data as possible so that the amount which may be needed can<lb/>
be as accurately determined as it is possible to do so at this time.</p>
<p>4. A cpoy of this letter is being furnished Surgeon Fricks.</p>
