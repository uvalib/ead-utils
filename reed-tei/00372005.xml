<p>THE WASHINGTON JEFFERSONIAN.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>close student by any means. He was a<lb/>
member of the old Washington literary so-<lb/>
ciety and won the honor in essay on one<lb/>
occasion in the inter-society contest. He<lb/>
was one of the founders of the JEFFERSON-<lb/>
IAN, and its first business manager. Mr.<lb/>
Welshons always took much interest and<lb/>
pride in his alma mater. and in recent years<lb/>
has been one of our most loyal supporters of<lb/>
college athletics. As a writer he had a style<lb/>
peculiarly his own, and it was conceded<lb/>
among all newspaper men of Pittsburg that<lb/>
he had no superior there. His memory was<lb/>
wonderful, and words and sentences came<lb/>
to him without any trouble. His editorials<lb/>
were gems, and his arguments could not be<lb/>
well refuted. Sarcasm, wit and brilliancy<lb/>
abounded in all of them as the occasion de-<lb/>
manded. In politics he had also taken a<lb/>
prominent part, successfully, too, in the<lb/>
way of party work, He had worked on<lb/>
nearly all the papers of Pittsburg, but prin-<lb/>
cipally on the Times, and had also worked<lb/>
for Philadelphia papers. Going to Pitts-<lb/>
burg with no experience, he was turned<lb/>
down by several newspapers, but it was not<lb/>
long until all regretted that turning down,<lb/>
and were anxious to employ him. One of<lb/>
his greatest pieces of newspaper work was<lb/>
in writing up the Johnstown flood for the<lb/>
Times at a time when the wires were down<lb/>
and there was no communication with that<lb/>
point. Welshons knew every foot of the<lb/>
flooded territory, and seated in the Time<unclear>;</unclear><lb/>
office wrote what turned out to be an accur-<lb/>
ate description, and all the other newspa-<lb/>
pers wondered how the Times had &ldquo;scoop-<lb/>
ed&rdquo; them.</p>
<p>'89--An official telegram from Cuba con-<lb/>
veys the sad intelligence of the death of Dr.<lb/>
Jesse W. Lazear, a young physician of great<lb/>
promise, in whom the citizens of Washing-<lb/>
ton and Western Pennsylvania feel an<lb/>
unusual interest. After leaving college he<lb/>
entered the Johns Hopkins University,<lb/>
graduating from the medical department<lb/>
with high honors. A year spent abroad<lb/>
still further fitted him for the practice of his<lb/>
noble profession. Last spring by appoint-<lb/>
ment of the United States government he,<lb/>
in company with two other physicians, went<lb/>
to Cuba to make a critical study of that<lb/>
dread scourge of the tropics, yellow fever,<lb/>
to which he has fallen a victim. Some<lb/>
years since he was united in marriage to<lb/>
Miss Mabel Houstman, a native of the state<lb/>
of California, who survives him together<lb/>
with two children. His family had accom-<lb/>
panied him on his visit to Cuba. Dr. La-<lb/>
zear comes of an old and honored Pennsyl-<lb/>
vania family, his grandfather being the Hon.<lb/>
Jesse Lazear, of Uniontown. His father<lb/>
was William Lazear. T. C. Lazear, Esq.,<lb/>
of Pittsburg, is an uncle. His untimely<lb/>
death is a loss to the profession of medicine,<lb/>
to which he was most devoted. He as<lb/>
truly died for mankind and his country as if<lb/>
he had fallen in the din of battle while fol-<lb/>
lowing the flag. His wife and children have<lb/>
the sympathy of an appreciative country.</p>

<p>'60--David Acheson McKnight, of Wash-<lb/>
ington, D. C., died at his home in the<lb/>
National Capital, Saturday, October 13,<lb/>
aged 57 years. Mr. McKnight was the son<lb/>
of Jas. McKnight, a prominent iron founder<lb/>
of Pittsburg, in which city he was born in<lb/>
1843. He chose the law as his profession<lb/>
and in it attained a position of eminence.</p>
<p>'99--John L. Stewart has severed his<lb/>
connection with the Observer, and has left<lb/>
for Cambridge, Mass., for the purpose of<lb/>
entering the law department of Harvard<lb/>
university.</p>
