FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
IN REPLY REFER TO:<lb/>
<dateline>
LETTERMAN GENERAL HOSPITAL<lb/>
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA<lb/>
<date value="1938-04-05">April 5, 1938</date>
</dateline>
Major General C. R. Reynolds<lb/>
The Surgeon General, U. S. Army<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Reynolds:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In going over my old papers I came across a letter from<lb/>
Major Walter Reed dated December 10, 1900, which seems to me to have<lb/>
considerable historical value. I am therefore sending you herewith<lb/>
photostat copies which you can send to the library or use as you think<lb/>
best.</p>
<p>The letter seems important because it is probably the first<lb/>
written report by Walter Reed of his first positive case at Camp<lb/>
Lazear; also because of the statement that the Havana Board of Yellow<lb/>
Fever, excepting Finlay, considered the mosquito theory a wild one.<lb/>
This Board consisted of Dr. Juan Gitueras, Carlos Finlay, Major W. C.<lb/>
Gorgas, and A. Diaz Albertini.</p>
<p>Camp Lazear was established during the time I was Post Sur-<lb/>
geon at Camp Columbia and I had much to do with the work of getting the<lb/>
camp ready. Experimental operations at the camp began on November 20.<lb/>
All of the non-immunes were quarantined from all outside contact from<lb/>
that date on.</p>
<p>Private Kissinger, the first case, was bitten by several of<lb/>
Reed's ripe &ldquo;birds&rdquo; on December 5. At 11:30 P.M. on the 8th he had a<lb/>
chill. On the next day Reed was positive that the case was Yellow<lb/>
Fever. You will note that the envelope addressed to me was postmarked<lb/>
at 8:00 A.M., December 10, 1900. I expect he was so thrilled and excited<lb/>
that he was up at dawn that date ready for a great day with the skeptical<lb/>
Yellow Fever experts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cooke and Company&rdquo; is the name we had for Dr. R. P. Cooke<lb/>
and the two enlisted men who were then living (practically confined) in<lb/>
the very small, poorly ventilated and filthy, infected bedding house. Dr.<lb/>
Cooke was a very likeable young Virginian and Walter Reed and the rest<lb/>
of us were very fond of him.</p>

<p>FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY</p>
<p>Further details of the experiment can, of course, be found in the<lb/>
Board's published report entitled, &ldquo;The Etiology of Yellow Fever - an<lb/>
Additional Note.&rdquo; This was read at the Pan-American Congress in Havana<lb/>
on February 4, 1901. You will note that the facts given in the letter to<lb/>
me are identical with the statements made in the official report although<lb/>
that was published some time later.</p>
<p>I am sorry that I did not look up this letter long ago but,<lb/>
while I knew it was among my papers, I did not realize until later its<lb/>
possible historical value especially if there are any more controversies<lb/>
over the matter in the future. I am, of course, pleased that this great<lb/>
man took time out at that exciting moment of his successful career to give<lb/>
me the very first news of his work at Camp Lazear. He was a real friend<lb/>
of mine and thought enough of my professional ability and experience with<lb/>
Yellow Fever to want me to be in Cienfuegos with his son who was then a<lb/>
Second Lieutenant of the 10th Infantry. Otherwise, as I think you know, I<lb/>
would have remained at Columbia Barracks with him as a member of his Board.<lb/>
I left there on November 30, 1900, under rush orders for Cienfuegos.<lb/>
Captain A. N. Stark relieved me at that time.</p>
<p>I have sent Generals Ireland and Kean copies of the Reed letter<lb/>
and asked them what disposition I should make of the original. My first<lb/>
thought was, of course, the library, but I will wait for suggestions from<lb/>
you all. The Letterman made the photostats for me and they are mailing<lb/>
them.</p>
<p>With best regards,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
Brigadier General, U. S. Army<lb/>
Retired</signed>
