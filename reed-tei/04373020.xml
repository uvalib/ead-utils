<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you for your letter concerning Major Walter Reed's 100th anni-<lb/>
versary. Unfortunately I have been on leave and unable to reply<lb/>
sooner.</p>
<p>Here in Washington, September 13 was proclaimed &ldquo;Walter Reed Day&rdquo; by<lb/>
the Commissioners governing the District of Columbia. The ceremony<lb/>
for presentation of the proclamation was attended by Major General<lb/>
Walter Reed, Colonel Joseph F. Siler and General Streit.</p>
<p>The Army Medical Museum conducted a special exhibit, while the Army<lb/>
Medical Center was renamed Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</p>
<p>This was all that took place in Washington, since the big plans which<lb/>
we had hoped for involving the highest Government officials had to<lb/>
be cancelled when these officials were unable to come. During that<lb/>
time we were constantly on the alert to get in touch with you should<lb/>
the event materialize.</p>
<p>The State of Virginia's Governor called for a state-wide observance<lb/>
of the centennial. At Gloucester and Belroi a program of commemora-<lb/>
tion was sponsored by the Virginia Medical Society and the Gloucester<lb/>
County Junior Chamber of Commerce. General Streit, scheduled to be<lb/>
principal speaker at this event had to cancel out because of airplane<lb/>
engine trouble. Brig. General Standlee read his speech.</p>
<p>At Harrisonburg, Colonel Joseph U. Weaver, deputy post commander of<lb/>
the Center, was the principal speaker and led a parade from Stoneleigh<lb/>
to Walter Reed Hall on Madison College campus where ceremonies were<lb/>
held.</p>
<p>New York University's College of Medicine opened a special Walter Reed<lb/>
exhibit at a tea held the 13th, at which a new portrait of Major Reed<lb/>
was unveiled. Special messages from Major General George Armstrong<lb/>
and General Streit were read.</p>

<p>Dr. Philip S. Hench - 2</p>
<p>The Commissioners of the county encompassing Murfreesboro, North Carolina<lb/>
also declared September 13 as Walter Reed Day.</p>
<p>The Washington Post carried a full page color reproduction of the Cornwell<lb/>
painting as well as an article on Major Reed and an Associated Press pic-<lb/>
ture of Mrs. Blossom Reed. I had presumed that the Post had contacted<lb/>
you since they were eager for your address.</p>
<p>A local Washington television station WTTG (Dumont) devoted a major por-<lb/>
tion of their Sunday, September 16 &ldquo;Pentagon-Washington&rdquo; program to the<lb/>
anniversary. In addition to General Streit, there appeared a Miss Lena<lb/>
Townshend, former Army contract nurse from Baltimore, Maryland who claims<lb/>
to have fed sugar water to the mosquitoes Major Reed used in his experi-<lb/>
ments in Cuba.</p>
<p>Another local television station WTOP (Columbia Broadcasting Company)<lb/>
also paid tribute on an evening program September 14.</p>
<p>With many thanks for your assistance in this centenary period, I remain,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Respectfully yours,</salute>
