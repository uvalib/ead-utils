<p>BY DEAN HALLIDAY.</p>
<p>Do you know them--the men who<lb/>
have died that you may live?</p>
<p>Reed, Carroll, Lazear, Rick-<lb/>
etts, McClintic, Miller, Rich-<lb/>
ardson, Wightman?</p>
<p>All martyrs to medicine. All men who<lb/>
made mankind richer for their living and<lb/>
nobler for their dying.</p>
<p>In history and in story the physician is<lb/>
known for his self sacrifice and his de-<lb/>
votion to his work, the alleviation of the<lb/>
sorrow and suffering of humanity. Should<lb/>
one attempt to enumerate the men who,<lb/>
like Rush, have fearlessly fought the pes-<lb/>
tilences that have raged from time to<lb/>
time; or the men who, like Marion Sims,<lb/>
have braved even popular opinion in the<lb/>
accomplishment of their life work; or the<lb/>
many whose lives have been sacrificed at<lb/>
the bedside or in the operating room the<lb/>
list would be endless.</p>
<p>The names listed above, however, are<lb/>
of men who will always stand among the<lb/>
first on the roll of Martyrs of Medicine.</p>
<p>The first to give up his life to the end<lb/>
that man might gain control over the<lb/>
dreadful scourge, yellow fever, was Dr.<lb/>
Jesse W. Lazear. As one friend and ad-<lb/>
mirer said of him, &ldquo;He died a martyr to<lb/>
science and a true hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Graduating from the College of Phy-<lb/>
sicians and Surgeons in New York city in<lb/>
1892, Dr. Lazear went abroad to study.<lb/>
Returning to this country he received his<lb/>
appointment as acting assistant surgeon<lb/>
in the medical department of the army in<lb/>
1900 and was at once dispatched to Co-<lb/>
lumbia barracks, Cuba, where he began<lb/>
work as a member of the famous yellow<lb/>
fever commission under the direction of<lb/>
another martyr to medicine, Dr. Walter<lb/>
Reed.</p>
<p>Lazear observed cases of yellow fever,<lb/>
made autopsies, took cultures and studied<lb/>
blood-films with the result that by the<lb/>
time Dr. Reed and his co-worker, Dr.<lb/>
James Carroll, reached Cuba some months<lb/>
later he was ready to say with confidence<lb/>
that cultures and blood examinations<lb/>
promised nothing in the prevention of the<lb/>
disease.</p>
<p>Attention was then given the mosquito<lb/>
as being the insect responsible for the<lb/>
spread of yellow fever and Dr. Lazear<lb/>
was placed in charge of this work. On<lb/>
August 11, 1900, Dr. Lazear made the first<lb/>
mosquito experiment. He made nine in-<lb/>
oculations on persons, including himself,<lb/>
but this work was without results.</p>
<p>A month later, however, while at Las<lb/>
Animas hospital, for the purpose of col-<lb/>
lecting blood from yellow fever patients, a<lb/>
mosquito alighted on his hand.</p>
<p>He allowed it to take its fill of his<lb/>
blood, although at the time, Dr. Lazear<lb/>
did not believe the mosquito to be one<lb/>
of the Culex Fasciatus, the species be-<lb/>
lieved to be responsible for transmitting<lb/>
the germs of yellow fever.</p>
<p>However, he voluntarily accepted all<lb/>
the chances that went with this inocula-<lb/>
tion and five days later he had his first<lb/>
warning of approaching disease and death<lb/>
in a severe attack of chills.</p>
<p>Instead of taking immediate measures<lb/>
to protect himself he seized on the op-<lb/>
portunity to use himself as a test case in<lb/>
the interest of science. All that night he<lb/>
spent writing up the experiments in re-<lb/>
gard to yellow fever and the mosquito in-<lb/>
oculations, making notes from time to<lb/>
time of his own case, of which no rec-<lb/>
ord had been made.</p>
<p>Early the next morning he handed over<lb/>
his precious material to Dr. Carroll and<lb/>
was then rushed to the hospital with a<lb/>
temperature of 103. Six days later he<lb/>
died from the fever.</p>
<p>His life was sacrificed when the great<lb/>
work was scarcely begun, yet, as Dr.<lb/>
Reed said, &ldquo;Dr. Lazear's efforts in this<lb/>
work were of vast importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. James Carroll, co-worker with Reed<lb/>
and Lazear, was the first man to contract<lb/>
yellow fever experimentally from the bite<lb/>
of an infected mosquito.</p>
<p>After serving in the army as private,<lb/>
corporal, sergeant, and later in the med-<lb/>
ical corps, he joined Reed and Lazear in<lb/>
Cuba in 1900 as a member of the yellow<lb/>
fever commission.</p>
<p>For the sake of the great work he was<lb/>
engaged in, he allowed himself to be bit-<lb/>
ten by a mosquito infected with yellow<lb/>
fever, on August 27, 1900, and was taken<lb/>
sick four days later. He had a very se-<lb/>
vere attack. Although he recovered at<lb/>
the time a serious heart trouble, myocar-<lb/>
ditis, followed as a direct result of the<lb/>
yellow fever. Dr. Carroll suffered from<lb/>
this for the rest of his life and it eventu-<lb/>
ally caused his death, September 16, 1907.</p>
<p>Another famous martyr to medicine<lb/>
was Dr. Walter Reed, who was the mas-<lb/>
ter mind in the work of solving the prob-<lb/>
lems of yellow fever. It was Reed, who<lb/>
as the head of the yellow fever commis-<lb/>
sion of 1900 quickly saw that this disease<lb/>
must be transmitted by some insect, prob-<lb/>
ably the mosquito, as suggested by a Dr.<lb/>
Finlay.</p>
<p>After studying the problem Reed and<lb/>
his co-workers concluded that the results,<lb/>
if positive, would be of sufficient service<lb/>
to humanity to justify the experimental<lb/>
use of human beings. The committee also<lb/>
agreed that it was their duty to run the<lb/>
first risk with the result that Drs. Car-<lb/>
roll and Lazear met their deaths as pre-<lb/>
viously told.</p>
<p>After starting their experiments,<lb/>
Reed wrote to his wife, &ldquo;just eighteen<lb/>
days from the time we began our ex-<lb/>
perimental work, we have succeeded in<lb/>
demonstrating that mosquitoes do<lb/>
spread the disease, so that the most<lb/>
doubtful and skeptical must believe.<lb/>
* * * Ah, wonderful is nature,<lb/>
and I thank God that he has allowed<lb/>
poor unworthy me to look a little way<lb/>
into this secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again he wrote, &ldquo; The prayer that<lb/>
has been mine for twenty years, that <unclear>it</unclear><lb/>
might be permitted in some way at<lb/>
some time to do something to alleviate<lb/>
human suffering, has been granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In February, 1901, after his work in<lb/>
Cuba was finished, Reed returned to<lb/>
Washington and resumed his teaching<lb/>
in the Army Medical school. He was<lb/>
also professor of pathology and bac-<lb/>
teriology at Columbia university.</p>
<p>But in 1902, when he returned to his<lb/>
work, it was evident that his strength<lb/>
was far below par. The day's work was<lb/>
too much for him. All mental exertion<lb/>
was a painful effort.</p>
<p>On November 17, 1902, he was oper-<lb/>
ated on for appendicitis, and then the<lb/>
overwork and anxiety borne during his<lb/>
work in fighting yellow fever had their<lb/>
effect, for he failed to rally properly<lb/>
from the operation, and a few days<lb/>
later, November 23, 1902, he died.</p>
<p>He was a martyr who at least had<lb/>
the satisfaction of finishing his work,<lb/>
and that it was a great work is best<lb/>
set forth by General Leonard Wood, who<lb/>
says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of no other man on this side<lb/>
of the world who has done so much for<lb/>
humanity as Dr. Walter Reed. His dis-<lb/>
covery results in the saving of more<lb/>
lives annually than were lost in the<lb/>
Cuban war, and saves the commercial<lb/>
interests of the world a greater finan-<lb/>
cial loss each year than the cost of the<lb/>
Cuban war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The armies at war in Europe, with<lb/>
the possible exception of the Serbian,<lb/>
have escaped in a miraculous manner,<lb/>
the ravages of dread typhus fever. That<lb/>
they have been able to adequately<lb/>
guard against the disease is greatly due<lb/>
to the martyrdom of Dr. Howard T.<lb/>
Ricketts, who demonstrated that typhus<lb/>
fever is carried by the body louse.</p>
<p>Ricketts was one of the most notable<lb/>
research workers of this country. In<lb/>
1907, after tireless work in Montana, to<lb/>
find the cause and prevention of Rocky<lb/>
mountain spotted fever, he proved that<lb/>
the disease was spread by the tick. In<lb/>
showing how to check the spread of this<lb/>
disease by the extermination of ticks by<lb/>
dipping domestic stock in an arsenical<lb/>
solution, and by killing off small wild<lb/>
animals that harbored the insects,<lb/>
Ricketts was not only saving the lives<lb/>
of a number of persons each year, but<lb/>
was checking a disease which had be-<lb/>
gun to spread throughout the entire<lb/>
west and into Canada also.</p>
<p>This work done, Ricketts went to<lb/>
Mexico City to study typhus fever. But<lb/>
in experiments in which he proved that<lb/>
the disease is carried by the body louse,<lb/>
he contracted the very disease he was<lb/>
combating, and died May 3 , 1910.</p>
<p>In his death &ldquo;on the firing line,&rdquo; the<lb/>
country lost an investigator of the first<lb/>
rank, whose name through his achieve-<lb/>
ments in investigating &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; and<lb/>
typhus fever will live in the history of<lb/>
medical science.</p>
<p>A second worker in Rocky mountain<lb/>
spotted fever to die on the &ldquo;firing line&rdquo;<lb/>
was Thomas B. McClintic, a passed as-<lb/>
sistant surgeon of the United States<lb/>
public health and marine hospital serv-<lb/>
ice.</p>
<p>In 1911 he was sent into the Bitter<lb/>
Root valley, where Rocky mountain<lb/>
spotted fever raged, to put into practice<lb/>
the theories regarding the disease and<lb/>
its prevention advanced by Dr. Ricketts.<lb/>
This meant ridding the valley of ticks.</p>
<p>In 1912 McClintic had made progress<lb/>
with his work, but just as he finished<lb/>
the season's work he contracted &ldquo;spot-<lb/>
ted&rdquo; fever, probably from the labora-<lb/>
tory. He lived only six days. As soon<lb/>
as he knew that he had this disease, he<lb/>
returned to Washington, where he died<lb/>
August 13, 1912.</p>
<p>Dr. Ricketts had taught us how<lb/>
Rocky mountain spotted fever could be<lb/>
controlled. Dr. McClintic gave us the<lb/>
practical demonstration of these teach-<lb/>
ings.</p>
<p>Still another fearless scientist who<lb/>
gave his life that mankind might be<lb/>
better protected against disease was Dr.<lb/>
William Whitfield Miller, an assistant<lb/>
surgeon in the United States public<lb/>
health and marine hospital service. He<lb/>
died in Washington, D. C., November<lb/>
24, 1908, of typhoid fever, contracted<lb/>
during experiments in the laboratory.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Dr. Miller<lb/>
was actively engaged in studying the<lb/>
origin and prevalence of typhoid fever<lb/>
in the District of Columbia. He had<lb/>
been working with a large number of<lb/>
specimens of typhoid material, having<lb/>
taken up this task at the suggestion of<lb/>
President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>At the International Sanitary Conven-<lb/>
tion of the American Republics, which<lb/>
was held in October, 1905, an agreement<lb/>
was provided between these republics<lb/>
concerning the quarantine treatment of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>It was considered necessary to thor-<lb/>
oughly protect all the southern ports of<lb/>
the United States, as well as the ports<lb/>
of our southern neighbors, from the in-<lb/>
vasion of yellow fever, and it was agreed<lb/>
that measures should be taken to elimin-<lb/>
ate from all ports the conditions which<lb/>
tend to produce this disease.</p>
<p>The government of Honduras asked<lb/>
the secretary of state of the United<lb/>
States for the services of a competent<lb/>
medical officer to take charge of the<lb/>
sanitation, particularly of the depart-<lb/>
ment of Cortez, in the interest, more es-<lb/>
pecially, of the fruit trade in that dis-<lb/>
trict.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Passed Assistant Surgeon<lb/>
T. F. Richardson, distinguished for his<lb/>
work against yellow fever, was put at<lb/>
the service of the Honduras government.<lb/>
On his way to Puerto, Cortez, however,<lb/>
he was stricken with typhoid fever, and<lb/>
died in New Orleans, March 19, 1906,<lb/>
thus giving another life in the health<lb/>
service of his country.</p>
<p>Following Richardson came Dr. Wil-<lb/>
liam Martin Wightman, who, during<lb/>
1906-08, was stationed at Callao, Peru,<lb/>
where he carried on antiplague work.<lb/>
After this he was sent to Guayaquil,<lb/>
Ecuador, to observe and take measures<lb/>
for preventing the spread of yellow fever.</p>
<p>But the fever got him first, and he<lb/>
died in Guayaquil, May 16, 1909 at the<lb/>
died in Guayaquil, May 16, 1909, at the<lb/>
age of thirty-three. Thus one more sol-<lb/>
dier was taken from the &ldquo;firing line&rdquo;<lb/>
and one more martyr added to the list<lb/>
for which yellow fever is responsible.</p>
<p>It was only five years ago in this<lb/>
country that a woman's name was added<lb/>
to the list of those who have met death<lb/>
in trying to defeat disease. She<lb/>
was Dr. Emma W. Mooers, graduate of<lb/>
the University of Michigan, curator of<lb/>
the neuropathological department at<lb/>
Harvard Medical School, and the assist-<lb/>
ant of Dr. Southard.</p>
<p>While examining the tissues of a man<lb/>
who had died from septic tonsilitis as<lb/>
part of their experiments, both Dr.<lb/>
Mooers and Dr. Southard became in-<lb/>
fected.</p>
<p>Dr. Southard, while very ill, recov-<lb/>
ered, but Dr. Mooers had streptococcus<lb/>
poisoning from which she died, May 1,<lb/>
1911.</p>
<p>At the time she became fatally in-<lb/>
fected, Dr. Mooers was searching for the<lb/>
cause of a widspread epidemic of viru-<lb/>
lent tonsilitis which had been present in<lb/>
Boston and vicinity, and she was trying<lb/>
to gain information in regard to the<lb/>
means necessary to check the epidemic.</p>
<p>Day and night the war against pre-<lb/>
ventable disease goes on. Time and<lb/>
time again some one drops on the &ldquo;firing<lb/>
line,&rdquo; and another takes their place.<lb/>
Each one, like Reed, lives in the hope<lb/>
that some day they will be able to do<lb/>
something for humanity. Some, like<lb/>
Reed, live to accomplish their object,<lb/>
others pave the way, but are stricken<lb/>
before they have reached their goal.</p>
<p>An officer of the United States public<lb/>
health service gives the following list of<lb/>
medical officers of the service who have<lb/>
died in studying and combating dis-<lb/>
ease</p>
<p>Seventeen men, while on quarantine<lb/>
duty, contracted yellow fever. Five of<lb/>
these men died: Glozier, Waldo, Groen-<lb/>
velt, McAdam and Wightman.</p>
<p>Eleven contracted tuberculosis in line<lb/>
of duty, and of these three died: Pro-<lb/>
chazka, Decker and Devan.</p>
<p>Four contracted amoebic dysentery in<lb/>
the Philippines. One of these men is<lb/>
permanently disabled.</p>
<p>Five contracted typhoid fever from<lb/>
direct exposure on field duty or in the<lb/>
laboratory. Of these, two, Miller and<lb/>
Richardson, died.</p>
<p>Two contracted smallpox in line of<lb/>
duty. One contracted typhus fever in<lb/>
Mexico. Two contracted cholera in line<lb/>
of duty. One died of Rocky mountain<lb/>
spotted fever.</p>
<p>During the period covered by these<lb/>
figures, the corps varied from 65 to 135<lb/>
and the average was 100--a brave hand-<lb/>
ful of men fighting always to save the<lb/>
lives of others, and when necessary, giv-<lb/>
ing their own lives to that end.</p>
<p>Is it worth it?</p>
<p>A large proportion of the diseases<lb/>
from which mankind suffers today are<lb/>
preventable. The time will come when<lb/>
such diseases as yellow fever and<lb/>
malaria will belong only to the ancient<lb/>
history of medicine.</p>
<p>All work, no matter how trivial or<lb/>
valueless it may seem, if it has been<lb/>
done with honesty of purpose, has its<lb/>
place in the great victory over pain and<lb/>
pestilence.</p>
<p>Were it possible to ask those who<lb/>
have fought in this cause and died for<lb/>
it, &ldquo;Was it worth while?&rdquo; they, too,<lb/>
would say that they rejoiced that<lb/>
they had not lived in vain, but had been<lb/>
allowed a little share in the work of<lb/>
alleviating the suffering of humanity.</p>
