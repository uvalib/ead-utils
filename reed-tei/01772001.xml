<salute>My dear Dorsey;</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is certainly &ldquo;high time&rdquo;<lb/>
that I was answering your letter, which<lb/>
came a week ago. In the very outset,<lb/>
my dear boy, let me urgently request that<lb/>
you will examine into the depths of your<lb/>
<unclear>pannier</unclear>, and see whether you find therein<lb/>
an old <hi>dental case</hi> - a leather case<lb/>
with an old gum lancet &amp; a few pairs<lb/>
of broken forceps &amp;c- My reason for this<lb/>
request is just this- Dr Oldmixon is re-<lb/>
-sponsible for the case of rental instruments<lb/>
&amp; the Surgeon General is chasing him<lb/>
all around the Country on the subject-<lb/>
Oldmixon writes to me inquiring wheth-<lb/>
-er he ever turned the case over to me<lb/>
or not- which I am pretty sure that<lb/>
he never did- However, old &ldquo;it shall<lb/>
be most excellent&rdquo; says if the<del>y</del> case<lb/>
is anywhere &ldquo;it shall be in the bottom<lb/>
of that <unclear>pannier</unclear> which shall have Dr<lb/>
McPherson&rdquo;! Now, you have the whole<lb/>
case in a &ldquo;Nut-shell&rdquo;- Let me hear<lb/>
from you, at your earliest convenience<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01772002"/>
so that I may enable Oldmixon to<lb/>
descend from the anxious stool, on which<lb/>
his &ldquo;carcass&rdquo; now reposes- Well, my<lb/>
dear Dorsey, I was grieved by your<lb/>
last letter- on your own &amp; my account-<lb/>
on yours, that you will have to drag<lb/>
your weary bones over the damnable<lb/>
hills &amp; gorges of our sister territory,<lb/>
&amp; on my own, that you will be kept<lb/>
away so long from Apache- I do<lb/>
hope that this expedition may forever<lb/>
wind up old vic's hash! The confounded<lb/>
Old &ldquo;Son of a gun&rdquo;! If you catch him<lb/>
for the Lord's sake, kill him <hi>very dead</hi>!<lb/>
It must be pleasant, though, to have, be-<lb/>
side Gatewood &amp; Tommy Lieut. Mills, an<lb/>
old Apacheite -- I presume you must<lb/>
occasionally enjoy sitting around the<lb/>
camp fire &amp; recalling events of other<lb/>
scouts &amp;c- Hesche! Mayhap, you would<lb/>
like to know the result of Captain<del>s</del><lb/>
Jack's whack at the fat K.O! well<lb/>
it has <hi>resulted</hi>, sure enough! and<lb/>
it seems that &ldquo;Johannes&rdquo;, the wonderfully<lb/>
smart <del><unclear></unclear></del> man that he thinks he is, was<lb/>
just preparing a beautiful little<lb/>
&ldquo;boomerang&rdquo;, which, returning to his<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01772003"/>
bosom, has dealt him a very savage<lb/>
blow on his proboscis! Such a <hi>Sting-<lb/>
ging</hi>, such a <hi>ringing</hi>, endorsement<lb/>
I never read. The Dep't. Commander<lb/>
tells old &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; that he has been keep-<lb/>
-ing a &ldquo;blackbook&rdquo; (yes, Sir, <hi>black-<lb/>
book</hi>!) on <del>th</del> his Commander Officer, a<lb/>
fact which <add>he</add> tells him in plain <add>language</add> <del>wont,</del><lb/>
and unfortunately for Jack, it's true! He<lb/>
also reminds him that he did not put<lb/>
these charges against the K.O., until he,<lb/>
(Jack) was called to order for a &ldquo;dir-<lb/>
iliction of duty on his own part!<lb/>
After salting the old man, in the bri-<lb/>
-niest vein, for a couple of pages,<lb/>
the Dep't. Com. reminds him, that if he,<lb/>
Jack, had <del>had meant</del><add>intended it for</add> the good of the<lb/>
service, he &ldquo;would unquestionably have<lb/>
preferred these charges as soon as<lb/>
the offences were Com<add>m</add>itted&rdquo;, &amp; winds<lb/>
up by requesting him to swallow<lb/>
the following pleasant draught, 3<lb/>
times a day, before meals, &ldquo;The holding<lb/>
in reserve charges <del>against</del> as a whip<lb/>
with which to castigate a Commanding<lb/>
Officer by a subordinate, is a practice<lb/>
not encouraged by <hi>high-toned</hi> Army<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01772004"/>
Officers, nor approved <add>of</add> at these<lb/>
Headquarters&rdquo;! for all of which may<lb/>
the good Lord be forever praised!<lb/>
The result of this has been just what<lb/>
might have been expected- the conceited<lb/>
Mr Viven, has retired into his hole, with-<lb/>
out so much as a growl! The bladder<lb/>
has been pricked &amp; the wind's all out!<lb/>
Me thinks, the K.O. will now take delight<lb/>
in daily sitting down on Johannes, the great.<lb/>
There is no news at Apache- A rumor,<lb/>
with the flavor of musty old age, floats<lb/>
about the garrison to the effect, that<lb/>
the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> horse goeth to Oregon surely<lb/>
this summer- Came all the way from the<lb/>
Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> of the Army to the Col. of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <unclear>c</unclear>-<lb/>
you can deal it out to Gatewood &amp; Tommy<lb/>
for all it is worth- It may help them<lb/>
to climb some rugged hill-side with<lb/>
a lighter heart- Captain Hentig<lb/>
returns shortly, but leaves Mrs. H. in<lb/>
Frisco -- Mrs. Frank had a &ldquo;kid,&rdquo; one<lb/>
week ago, a &ldquo;gal kid,&rdquo; &amp; Frank is, by far,<lb/>
the largest man in the Garrison! The K.O,<lb/>
owing to Drunkeness on part of &ldquo;patriots,&rdquo;<lb/>
has closed the bar indefinitely, &amp; Lacy is<lb/>
happy accordingly- With best love to Tommy, Mills<lb/>
&amp;Gatewood &amp; an earnest hope that you will soon<lb/>
return to my parental bosom,</p>
<closer>
<salute>I remain, forever, yours,</salute>
<signed>Bolus</signed>.
