<salute>My dear Miss Harvey:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your name was given to me by Mr. Cal Smith, Manager of our local televi-<lb/>
sion station, <unclear>KROC-TV</unclear></p>
<p>My family and I have been viewing with interest the excellent program on<lb/>
Sunday afternoon, entitled &ldquo;You Are There.&rdquo; Early this summer one of<lb/>
these presentations concerned the conquest of yellow fever and the work<lb/>
of the U. S. Army Yellow Fever Board in Cuba. I assume that these pre-<lb/>
sentations are on 16 mm. film, presumably with sound. The particular<lb/>
program I refer to was telecast on May 17, 1953, Channel 4, at 4 p.m.<lb/>
I think the sponsors were announced as &ldquo;America's Electric Light and<lb/>
Power Companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For about 15 years my main hobby has been to track down the complete<lb/>
story of the conquest of yellow fever. I have written a number of<lb/>
articles on it, visited Havana several times, interviewed the survivors<lb/>
of the experiments, etc. My colleagues at the Mayo Clinic have followed<lb/>
this work with sympathetic interest.</p>
<p>Would it be possible for me to borrow this film, either to show privately<lb/>
to a small group of friends and members of the Mayo Clinic Staff, or per-<lb/>
haps even to show at some larger meeting? Some months ago I attended the<lb/>
dedication by the Cuban Government of &ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo; just outside of Havana<lb/>
where Walter Reed and colleagues did their work. I have been asked to<lb/>
describe the dedicatory ceremonies before the staff of the Mayo Clinic.<lb/>
It occurred to me that perhaps a showing of this film would be an ex-<lb/>
cellent prelude to my description of the dedication ceremonies as this<lb/>
film would show in excellent fashion the significance of the place. Is<lb/>
there a rental on this film or could it be borrowed for two or three days,<lb/>
gratis?</p>
