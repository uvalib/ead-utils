<salute>Dear Dr. Hench,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yours of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> re the Wyeth painting<lb/>
came this a.m. Thank's for the reprint on<lb/>
<unclear>gout.</unclear></p>
<p>I dont think you read my letter to<lb/>
Mr Kellogg carefully;- <hi>First</hi>, I was not<lb/>
commenting on the painting of the ward buildings,<lb/>
(They <hi>were painted</hi> when constructed) but on the <hi>officers<lb/>
quarters</hi> which were built in July '99- <hi>Second</hi>, I<lb/>
think my remarks are clear about perp<add>et</add>uating<lb/>
distortions which are controversial. There<lb/>
would be no controversy about a group scene<lb/>
such as I suggested. The more I think of it<lb/>
the more I am in favor of my suggestion.<lb/>
I think it would be a wonderful thing to<lb/>
have the whole group (Wood, Finlay, Reed Board,<lb/>
and <hi>all</hi> Roll of Honor men) reproduced. That<lb/>
<hi>would</hi> mean something! I do hope that<lb/>
Mr. Kellogg will not be<del>x</del> too hasty in<lb/>
deciding on the matter, for, with a little<lb/>
patience and collaboration, the possibilities<lb/>
for something very good, are wonderful-</p>
<p>I am of course merely trying to be<lb/>
helpful in a construction way. I am<lb/>
too busy to take this out to be typed, but<lb/>
if you think it with while please quote<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06302057"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
me when you write to Mr Kellogg-<lb/>
I am anxious to know what my old<lb/>
friend, Jefferson Randolph Kean, has to say<lb/>
about the picture. He has good ideas, but<lb/>
for some reason, I feel he <del>will</del> may not<lb/>
concur with me re General Wood. However,<lb/>
he knows, as you know and as I know<lb/>
that the Reed board would never <add>have</add> undertaken<lb/>
the experimentation on human subjects without<lb/>
the encouragement and full support of Wood.</p>
<p>I will inclose herewith the papers<lb/>
etc. <unclear>re.</unclear> your report to Dr. Ramos, I<lb/>
would like to keep some of the photos and<lb/>
will hold them here pending your approval.</p>
<p>Here is the list:-<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>No. 24 Moran &amp; Senora Rojas</item>
<item>34 Composite drawing, Camp Lazear</item>
<item>36}Building No. 1.</item>
<item>37}</item>
<item>40}</item>
<item>41}1902 maps</item>
<item>42}Columbia Bks.</item>
<item>45}</item>
<item>46}Perez model-</item>
<item>47}</item>
<item>48}</item>
</list></p>
<p>The 1902 map is splendid. The Perez model<lb/>
is still a mess. I suggest you send the enlarged<lb/>
1902 map to Col. Willis and suggest that he <del>pay</del><lb/>
remove the buildings from the least of the model<lb/>
and place them on a flat piece of ground in<lb/>
accordance with the scale on the small map. The<lb/>
enlarged map scale can be readily estimated, roughly<lb/>
it seems 70 ft=1 inch. Then if Col. Willis<lb/>
will make a photo. of the layout it would be<lb/>
worth something. The 1907 map shows the contours<lb/>
and would help in showing the grades especially<lb/>
in the Western part of the hospital grounds &amp;<lb/>
(y.f. hosp.)</p>
<pb n="3" id="f06302058"/>
<p>3</p>
<p>I dont know where the key to the 1902<lb/>
map can be found. Probably the <unclear>D.M. g.o.</unclear><lb/>
can find it in Major Baker's report.<lb/>
On page 48 of his report, (in the 1901<lb/>
report of Gen. Wood) you will note that<lb/>
&ldquo;Prints were forwarded.&rdquo; Two of these were<lb/>
&ldquo;Columbia Bks.&rdquo; probably maps &amp; In case<lb/>
you find no trace of a key I suggest<lb/>
that you send copies of the map to<lb/>
Capt. England and Andrus for verification<lb/>
for I know that their memories are still<lb/>
keen and they knew the place intimately.</p>
<p>Please do not go to the trouble of<lb/>
making photostats of your W. &amp; J. talk.<lb/>
I will gladly wait for reprints until<lb/>
you have the article republished.</p>
<p>I hope you have a successful<lb/>
and enjoyable trip to Cuba- I like<lb/>
your suggestions re memoralizing Camp<lb/>
Lazear and the place where Lazear died,<lb/>
especially the latter. It is a wonderful<lb/>
site and a five building there housing<lb/>
the old building no. 1. meets my ideas<lb/>
exactly. While you are in Havana you<lb/>
may find that the Cuban Army authorities have<lb/>
some good photos. of the Columbia Bks Hospital<lb/>
buildings. They used them for some years<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06302059"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
If Dr. Ramos approves your plans<lb/>
it will be very important to be sure<lb/>
about the exact spot of Lazear's death. I<lb/>
am on the track of the attendants who worked<lb/>
on his case and before I finish think<lb/>
I can tell you the exact building <add>where</add> he died.<lb/>
I believe from info I now have that it<lb/>
was either 116 or 115 on <del>the</del> the 1902 map.<lb/>
It will help me if you can send me<lb/>
about 3 copies of the enlarged 1902 map so<lb/>
I can send them around to the men.<lb/>
I have definitely found out that Andrus was<lb/>
in 116. I got this &ldquo;dope&rdquo; from Lambert. The latter<lb/>
unfortunately was not on Lazear's case. By the time<lb/>
you return I will probably have more info.<lb/>
So if the Cuban govt. wants &ldquo;<hi>expert</hi>&rdquo; advice<lb/>
on the locations, arrange <del>at</del> a trip for me<lb/>
sorry I can't be there with you on this trip.<lb/>
I wonder if Dr. Sawyer could not<lb/>
interest the Rockefeller foundation in assisting<lb/>
financially in a suitable memorial on the<lb/>
y.f. site. I am sure they are deeply interested in<lb/>
everything that pertains to the work in Cuba-</p>
<p>Please do not forget to send me the maps <hi>before<lb/>
you leave Rochester</hi>-</p>
<p>If I left anything out of the letter<lb/>
to Dr. Ramos advise me and I will<lb/>
be glad to add whatever you suggest.</p>

<salute>Very Sincerely</salute>
