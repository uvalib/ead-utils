Mr. H. Carter Redd<lb/>
1104 Travelers Building<lb/>
Richmond, Virginia<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Redd:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just returned from a considerable vacation in Florida and<lb/>
Cuba. The trunk has just arrived and I am delighted to have it. The night<lb/>
it arrived, I spent the whole evening making a preliminary re-arrangement.<lb/>
The material had gotten pretty confused and mixed up as the trunk was bumped<lb/>
around in passage but everything was safe. I have made various piles - one of<lb/>
reprints written by Doctor Carter, one of reprints or papers written by others,<lb/>
one of his notebooks and one large pile of his letters and a final large pile<lb/>
of miscellaneous items.</p>
<p>Of course, I have hardly begun to examine the material but I did<lb/>
skim through the letters hastily and found none from or to Walter Reed or<lb/>
Lazear. I was rather disappointed in this. I understood that either you<lb/>
or his son had come across some letters from or to Reed.</p>
<p>May I assume that there is no hurry about my returning this mass<lb/>
of material? It is in my home, under constant supervision and will not be<lb/>
lost. I am so busy that I can only give certain evening hours or hours on<lb/>
Sunday to the material. It may take weeks for me to go over the material<lb/>
studiously and with appropriate care, making notes of this and that. When<lb/>
I return it to you, I can assure you it will be arranged in an orderly manner.<lb/>
I am going to re-arrange the letters in separate piles so that the correspon-<lb/>
dence between Doctor Carter and a certain individual is in one place. At the<lb/>
moment it is pretty much mixed up.</p>
<p>You mentioned in your letter of April 3, &ldquo;a lot of photographs&rdquo;.<lb/>
I wondered if they are unframed if it would be possible for you to send them<lb/>
to me. There might be therein some rare photograph of Doctor Carter in Cuba<lb/>
perhaps even with Reed or Lazear. In the material you sent, there are a few<lb/>
small snapshots, but apparently not taken in Cuba. I would certainly like to<lb/>
find a photograph of Doctor Carter in Cuba. Of especial interest were the<lb/>
very few letters from Doctor Carter to his wife and son written from Cuba.<lb/>
There aren't many and I was disappointed in this. Most of the correspondence<lb/>
begins some years after 1900. Do you have any idea where there might be some<lb/>
of his correspondence between 1888 and 1902?</p>
<p>I am sending a carbon copy of this letter to his son, Dr. Henry R. Carter,<lb/>
Jr. I do appreciate very greatly the courtesy of both of you in letting me go<lb/>
over the material.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
