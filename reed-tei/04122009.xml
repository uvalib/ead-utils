General and Mrs. W. L. Reed<lb/>
2810--36th Place, North West<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General and Mrs. Reed:</salute>
</opener>
<p>By separate post I am sending you some small enlargements<lb/>
of the snapshots I took at the recent Board Meeting of the<lb/>
Walter Reed Memorial Association. I have sent copies to Mrs. Reed<lb/>
and to Blossom Reed--also to the other Members of the Board. They<lb/>
were taken with a little $5 &ldquo;flash&rdquo; Brownie so please don't compare<lb/>
them with professional photographs. I had such a grand time with<lb/>
you that evening in Washington and Miss Schnurr enjoyed it so<lb/>
very much. I am anxious to see her notes--I think she will be<lb/>
here on a short visit soon. Your notes will be of tremendous help<lb/>
to me.</p>
<p>It was so nice to see your mother again as I passed<lb/>
through Blue Ridge Summit on my way to Mercersburg. I was anxious<lb/>
to see your father's home there--I had a little trouble finding<lb/>
it but Mr. Harry Cox kindly took me to what he thought was it.<lb/>
I enclose a snapshot of it. According to him, it is now known as<lb/>
the Hahn Place on Mount Anglewood. I sincerely hope I was not<lb/>
misinformed. Would you kindly identify the photographs in the<lb/>
enclosed snapshots? Should you wish an enlargement of the better<lb/>
one, I should be delighted indeed to send it to you. Is the house<lb/>
pretty much as it was when your father lived there, or has it<lb/>
been materially changed?</p>
<p>I also enclose the photograph of the apartment house in<lb/>
Washington which General Kean identified as the one in which your<lb/>
family and his family lived in 1902. As I remember, your family<lb/>
lived on the first floor on the left in the photograph. General<lb/>
Kean thought you had lived on the second floor. Is this the right<lb/>
apartment?</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed, I believe you and I share a fondness for<lb/>
candy; and, having lived half of my life in Pittsburgh. I have always<lb/>
loved <unclear>Reymer's</unclear> candy. I tried to order a box to be sent to you<lb/>
before Christmas, but received word that they were no longer accepting<lb/>
mail orders until after Christmas. Will you please accept in due<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04122010"/>
General and Mrs. W. L. Reed<lb/>

December 19, 1946<lb/>
time this little token of my very deep appreciation for all<lb/>
that you have done and with belated Christmas wishes.</p>
