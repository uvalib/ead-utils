<salute>Sir:</salute>
Attention Dr. F. F. Russell<lb/>
</opener>
<p>The prospects for transportation to Merida are not bright for<lb/>
the very near future. It appears that the plans of the Federal Government<lb/>
is to clear the Isthmus before beginning a campaign against the rebels in<lb/>
Yucatan, this may take months to accomplish.</p>
<p>My work in Veracruz will be concluded within the next few days<lb/>
when I plan to return to Tampico and will visit if possible the Huastecas<lb/>
and Tuxpam after which I will be ready to return to the States.</p>
<p>While in Veracruz I am visiting the Hospitals, Sanatoriums,<lb/>
Military Dispensaries and conferring with as many of the practicing physi-<lb/>
cians as can be reached and more especially with Drs. Iglesias and Loyo,<lb/>
both of whom are connected with the military and civil hospitals, and they<lb/>
assure me that there has not been any cases suspicious of yellow fever in-<lb/>
fection. I have carefully studied the mortality records and do not find<lb/>
in them any suggestion of yellow fever.</p>
<p>The military are interested in this infection and have been<lb/>
specially directed to be on the lookout for it. They all report in the<lb/>
negative.</p>
<p>Doctor Gimbler, representative for the U.S.P.H. Service in this<lb/>
Port, has made an independent investigation and is reporting to his Bureau<lb/>
that he cannot find any trace of yellow fever here. From instructions<lb/>
received by Doctor Gimbler it appears that the quarantine or close season<lb/>
between Mexican and United States ports will start on April 1st next and<lb/>
that ships will be fumigated before leaving here or on arrival at a U.S.<lb/>
port. No passenger quarantine is contemplated.</p>
<p>The Departamento has detailed Doctor Juan Graham Casasus to<lb/>
Veracruz and instructed him to inaugurate an anti-mosquito service in this<lb/>
city. The work actually started on March 1st and will continue as long<lb/>
as funds are available for this class of work.</p>
<p>You will be interested to know that Doctor Alfredo Iglesias has<lb/>
been continued by the Departamento as Bacteriologist for this zone. The<lb/>
cultures of leptospira icteroides which the doctor carried with him from<lb/>
New York are available for use by the Departamento.</p>
<p>With very good wishes, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
