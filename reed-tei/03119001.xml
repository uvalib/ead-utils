<salute>My dear Mr. Peabody:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you very much for your letter of June 4th. I am greatly relieved<lb/>
and reassured by what you tell me you have accomplished. When I read<lb/>
that dreadful little newspaper clipping, it seemed to me that a world<lb/>
where the Imponderables--love, courage, endurance and sacrifice--could<lb/>
be forgotten or at least ignored, was not worth living in! This is prob-<lb/>
ably because I am getting old and stupid, and realize my own powerless-<lb/>
ness to help along; but when I read what <hi>you</hi> have accomplished in the way<lb/>
of bringing these Imponderables home to us, I do lift up my heart! How<lb/>
perfectly splendid it is to have Dr. Fosdick's voice summoning people to<lb/>
get busy about Kissinger and the others! Now as you say, the thing is<lb/>
to arouse Congress. But when you say that, I feel as if you were under-<lb/>
taking to clean the Augean stables. But you will do it!</p>
<p>I am so glad to know there is any chance of meeting you and Mrs. Pea-<lb/>
body this summer. My friend, Miss Annable, and I are here in my little<lb/>
house by the river, with our big sheep dog, Roger; and if, when you reach<lb/>
Pine Point, you will come and have lunch with us some day, you will give<lb/>
us great pleasure. I wondered, as I read your letter, whether you would<lb/>
be willing to let me ask some people to meet you after luncheon--so that<lb/>
you could tell us whether we could be of any use about the &ldquo;Stables&rdquo;?<lb/>
I am pretty sure more money will come in; but of course what you want<lb/>
now, is to put firecrackers under the chair of every Congressman in this<lb/>
forgetful democracy of ours. How can we help do it?</p>
<p>Will you give this little check (it is so little I am ashamed to send<lb/>
it to you!) to Mrs. Kissinger, from me, and say I hope she can use it for<lb/>
her garden?--That is, if her garden is like mine in its demand for fer-<lb/>
tilizers, and bone meal, and all the rest of the things a garden clamors<lb/>
for!</p>
<p>I am so glad that you liked Dr. Lavendar. I wonder what he would<lb/>
think of the world as it is now. As for Willy King, do you suppose he<lb/>
really could have believed that mosquito netting would make it possible<lb/>
to build the Panama Canal?</p>
<p>I am venturing to keep the letters you sent me for a few days, because<lb/>
I want to read them to one or two people up here, with a view to inter-<lb/>
esting them in firecrackers.</p>

<salute>Faithfully yours,</salute>
