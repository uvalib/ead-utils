<p>after the boys. This second women<lb/>
was so drunk that she dropped<lb/>
the baby on its head on the cobble-<lb/>
stone. The baby rolled into the<lb/>
gutter, insensible, and probably dead.<lb/>
At any rate it must have died<lb/>
soon after. I have been walking<lb/>
around in all parts of the town<lb/>
and I have seen many other<lb/>
disgusting sights but as I <del>learn</del><lb/>
want to learn all I can of the<lb/>
people here. I persist in it,<lb/>
although it is anything but a<lb/>
pleasure.</p>
<p>It amuses me to hear the people<lb/>
here speak of the glory of old Scotland<lb/>
and talk of the union with England<lb/>
as a calamity. What would Scotland<lb/>
be but for its proximity to England.<lb/>
Nothing, or worse,</p>


<p>Saturday June 14</p>
<p>Please find out what would be a good<lb/>
wedding present for me get for <unclear>Jess</unclear> and<lb/>
Christine. I might be able to do<lb/>
something to more advantage in<lb/>
London or Paris than in New York.<lb/>
You must be careful of yourself so as<lb/>
not to take those colds. The climate<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00134002"/>
of Pittsburgh is very changeable.</p>
<p>Here it is cold all the time. The<lb/>
east wind is very penetrating.</p>
<p>The course in Anatomy which I<lb/>
am taking is very fine. There are three<lb/>
demonstrations every day and two<lb/>
examinations each week, one is on<lb/>
each mans dissection and the other<lb/>
on the subjects treated on in the<lb/>
demonstrations both, are oral,<lb/>
and on the <unclear>cadaver</unclear>. The instructors<lb/>
are all excellent men and spare<lb/>
no pains in trying to make you learn<lb/>
the subject. They really teach. In<lb/>
New York they lecture and give you<lb/>
a chance learn if you happen to<lb/>
feel like listening. Here they give<lb/>
attention to each man separately.</p>
<p>I am sure that I have done a<lb/>
good thing in coming here for this<lb/>
course. Although the anatomy<lb/>
is so <del><unclear>f</unclear></del> superior here, I am told by<lb/>
the New York fellows who have seen<lb/>
operations here, that they are not<lb/>
up to New York in Surgery. Waring<lb/>
was very much shocked the loose<lb/>
and dirty way they went at their<lb/>
work.</p>
<p>The excellency of the anatomy is chiefly<lb/>
due to the energy and enthusiasm<lb/>
of the professor, Sir William Turner</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00134003"/>
<p>5.</p>
<p>Everyday, he comes into the dissecting<lb/>
room and goes to each man who<lb/>
is working there. He is an easy<lb/>
pleasant talker and a fine dissector.</p>
<p>He always asks you a few questions<lb/>
then shows you some points about the<lb/>
dissection and then gives you some<lb/>
information, about surgical operations<lb/>
in the region you are dissecting<lb/>
usually mentioning some particular<lb/>
case. I am dissecting the axilla<lb/>
and yesterday he explained about<lb/>
the operation which resulted fatally<lb/>
on young Lincoln, it being in the<lb/>
region of the axilla. Besides the professor<lb/>
there are always half a dozen demonstra-<lb/>
tors in the room who are always<lb/>
ready to tell anything you want<lb/>
to know.</p>
<p>I think that before I leave Scotland.<lb/>
I shall take a day up in the lakes.<lb/>
I can make a trip through the <unclear>Trossacks</unclear><lb/>
Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond all<lb/>
in a day and for about five dollars.<lb/>
I received a &ldquo;Bulletin&rdquo; yesterday from<lb/>
Uncle Tom, I am always glad to get<lb/>
the papers. The American news in the<lb/>
Edinburgh papers is confined to the<lb/>
stock quotations, cyclones and railway<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00134004"/>
wrecks. <del>They</del> The people here think<lb/>
that we have a trouble climate in<lb/>
America, and that we are in<lb/>
constant peril from tornadoes etc.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
