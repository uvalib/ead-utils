OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY COLLECTOR<lb/>
Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>
C/O Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota<lb/>
<salute>Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Receipt is acknowledged of your letter of November 10th requesting<lb/>
advice concerning the contemplated importation by you of boards and/or<lb/>
lumber salvaged from the remains of &ldquo;Reed's Building No. 1.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am advised by Mr. H. W. Hecker, Inspector in Charge of the United<lb/>
States Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quar-<lb/>
antine at St. Paul that there is no restriction by his department on<lb/>
the importation of boards or lumber, as such, but that you might experi-<lb/>
ence some difficulty in effecting importation of such items if they were<lb/>
found to be infested with termites or other insects or larva as there<lb/>
is a restriction on the movement of live insects or larva.</p>
<p>He therefore suggests you contact the Cuban Ministry of Agriculture,<lb/>
Division of Plant Sanitation, Havana, Cuba, and endeavor to arrange with<lb/>
them for examination of the boards and lumber; fumigation of same if<lb/>
deemed necessary; and certification by them as to their action and<lb/>
findings.</p>
<p>The rate of duty applicable to boards is dependent on the kind of<lb/>
wood from which the board was made and since your letter did not indi-<lb/>
cate the kind or kinds of wood used I cannot, without quoting all of<lb/>
the rates, advise you as to the applicable rate of duty. In addition<lb/>
to the duty which may be applicable there is an import tax applicable<lb/>
on boards and lumber. However, the combined duty, if any, and the<lb/>
import tax would probably not exceed $1.50 per thousand board feet.</p>
<p>The consignee of import shipments, other than those arriving by mail,<lb/>
is obliged to appear at the U. S. Customs Office <hi>at the port through<lb/>
which</hi> the shipment enters the United States and attend to the entry and<lb/>
clearance of his shipment or if it is inconvenient for him to so appear<lb/>
he may employ a licensed customhouse broker to act in his behalf.</p>
<p>The entry covering the merchandise will not be accepted by the U.S.<lb/>
Customs until after the arrival of the shipment within the port limits.<lb/>
If the entry is not filed with the Customs Office having control of the<lb/>
shipment within the forty-eight hours following day of arrival the ship-<lb/>
ment will be considered as being unclaimed and will be taken possession<lb/>
of and stored by the Collector of Customs at the risk and expense of<lb/>
the consignee.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f04508004"/>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>It is respectfully recommended you arrange to have the shipment<lb/>
cleared through Customs at the seaboard rather than through some in-<lb/>
land port such as St. Paul as you will probably be obliged to employ<lb/>
a licensed customhouse broker to act in your behalf at the seaboard<lb/>
and it is believed it would best serve your interest to have him ef-<lb/>
fect clearance of the shipment rather than to have him forward it to<lb/>
an inland port for clearance at such secondary port.</p>
<p>No special packing or sealing is needed insofar as U. S. Customs<lb/>
are concerned.</p>
<p>Insofar as we are able to determine there is no representative<lb/>
of the U. S. Customs or the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine<lb/>
located in Cuba who could inspect the material prior to shipment.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Respectfully,</salute>

Deputy Collector in Charge</signed>
