<p>3. The last case of yellow fever in <hi>Central America</hi> as far as<lb/>
we know was that of a Mr. Seaman who died of yellow fever in New Orleans<lb/>
on December 7, having embarked from Puerto Barrios November 29, 1919. In<lb/>
Dec 3<lb/>
my judgment he contracted his disease in San Salvador the night of November<lb/>
23, a sporadic case, a reminder of the epidemic which had apparently ended<lb/>
October 15, 1919. Since then suspicious cases have been reported in San<lb/>
Salvador, but not from very reliable sources. Protective anti-mosquito<lb/>
work is being carefully followed in Salvador as well as in other Central<lb/>
American Republics. No cases have been reported or found in Guatemala<lb/>
since 1918.</p>
<p>The last case in Honduras was in September 1919.<lb/>
" " " " Nicaragua " " November "</p>
<p>None in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>4. <hi>Mexico</hi>: The last case reported in Yucatan was in December<lb/>
of last year (1919). A recent report secured by Dr. Gomler of the United<lb/>
States Public Health Service, for <unclear>us</unclear>, gives the annual number of cases and<lb/>
deaths by months, from 1899 to 1920 inclusive:</p>

<p>My recent investigations in Mexico (November and December 1919)<lb/>
convinced me that the disease was pretty generally spread out along the<lb/>
Southern and Western boundaries of Mexico as a whole, but definite data<lb/>
are lacking. (See Journal of Lyster, Central America and Mexico, 1919)</p>
<p>5. <hi>Brazil</hi>: Two cases of yellow fever were discovered in Rio<lb/>
de Janeiro during the year of 1919, one in May and the second in June.<lb/>
None since. In the north of Brazil, the spread of the disease has been<lb/>
confined to the coastal area between Bahia and Pernambuco. There was no<lb/>
large number of cases at any one point when I was along this coast in<lb/>
March of this year, but cases were being regularly reported every day or<lb/>
so in the various large seaports in this area. The anti-yellow fever work<lb/>
was well in hand, and the chances of complete elimination before the end<lb/>
of this year seemed bright.</p>
<p>What Brazil is doing is shown rather well in the following report<lb/>
(see my Journal, Brazil, 1920), of Yellow Fever Service of 1919:<lb/>

<p>6. <hi>West Africa</hi>: Whether or not yellow fever exists in West<lb/>
Africa has not been convincingly settled in spite of the extensive work<lb/>
done by the British Yellow Fever Commission as shown in their four<del>th</del> re-<lb/>
ports, 1914-1917. On pages 255-256, Section IV. of the <hi>Fourth and Final<lb/>
Report</hi>, their general conclusions were as follows, what is known being<lb/>
stated in condensed form:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the three Reports already issued by the Commission certain<lb/>
conclusions are stated which, with others contained in this Report,<lb/>
are here summarised for purposes of reference:-</p>
<p>(1) That the following fevers, other than Yellow Fever and<lb/>
Malarial Fever, are not with on the West Coast of Africa, viz.:-<lb/>
Typhoid Fever, Paratyphoid Fever, Pappataci Fever, and (possibly)<lb/>
Undulent Fever and Seven Days' Fever, and possibly also Dengue Fever<lb/>
in a sporadic form, but that there is no evidence of the occurrence<lb/>
of widespread epidemics of any of these fevers in recent times.</p>
<p>(2) That Malarial Fever is the most widely spread of the fevers<lb/>
met with in West Africa.</p>
<p>(3) That Yellow Fever is an endemic disease of the British<lb/>
and other Dependencies on the West Coast of Africa. No sufficient<lb/>
evidence has been obtained that the disease occurs in the Republic<lb/>
of Liberia.</p>
<p>(4) The number of cases diagnosed in the British Dependencies<lb/>
as Yellow Fever has not exceeded sixty in any one year during the<lb/>
last six years, nor one hundred and eighty in all; but the Commis-<lb/>
sion are of opinion that many more cases have occurred.</p>
<p>(5) That probably the continuous presence of the disease is<lb/>
maintained by the existence of endemic foci and areas or otherwise,<lb/>
rather than by its almost universal prevalence amongst the native<lb/>
population.</p>
<p>(6) That the native population is not immune to Yellow Fever,<lb/>
although, as a rule, when attacked, the natives suffer from a milder<lb/>
type of the disease than the Europeans.</p>
<p>(7) That the nature of the virus of Yellow Fever remains un-<lb/>
known.</p>
<p>(8) That there is no evidence that Yellow Fever has been brought<lb/>
to West Africa during recent periods from outside Africa.</p>
<pb n="6" id="f00825006"/>
<p>6</p>
<p>(9) That epidemics of a disease have occurred in other parts of<lb/>
Africa presenting some features of a character similar to those met<lb/>
with in Yellow Fever, and that in these epidemics the mortality amongst<lb/>
the natives appears to have been much greater than usually now occurs<lb/>
when natives of the Dependencies on the West Coast are attacked by Yel-<lb/>
low Fever.</p>
<p>(10) That a disease of uncertain nature, known to the natives<lb/>
by various names, as for example, Bayloo, Uto Enyin, or Yellow Eyes,<lb/>
prevails in certain Dependencies, usually at a distance from the coast.</p>
<p>(11) That the knowledge of the diseases, other than Malaria,<lb/>
common amongst the natives, both children and adults, inhabiting the<lb/>
&ldquo;bush&rdquo; is very defective.</p>
<p>The Commission feel that it is hardly necessary to emphasize<lb/>
the prime importance of a vigorous prosecution of anti-mosquito<lb/>
measures against all mosquito-borne diseases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above preliminary report has been rapidly collected for im-<lb/>
mediate delivery to you as you requested. An article is now in preparation<lb/>
by me with the following title,- <hi>Yellow Fever -- Its American Distribution<lb/>
and Control in 1920</hi>. This article will show as far as possible the<del>t</del> progress<lb/>
of the disease up to the present time.</p>
<p>Regretting that sufficient time is not available to put this re-<lb/>
port in better shape, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Respectfully,</salute>
