<salute>My own precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You perceive<lb/>
that I am writing <hi>this</hi> letter a<lb/>
little later in the day than I am<lb/>
accustomed- I wrote to that<lb/>
small baby girl of ours early<lb/>
this morning, and had proposed<lb/>
to write to sweet farmer-lady<lb/>
tomorrow morning; but as I<lb/>
got another letter to-day (Sun-<lb/>
day) as well as one yester-<lb/>
day, I must write a little bit<lb/>
to-night and finish in the morning.<lb/>
I felt very certain, lovie, dear,<lb/>
that when you saw that para-<lb/>
graph about yellow fever<lb/>
at Quemados, in the evening<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02055002"/>
Star, (I had seen it in Dr Stark's<lb/>
paper) you would cut it out<lb/>
and send it to me, and ask what<lb/>
in the world it meant! I have<lb/>
said nothing about yellow<lb/>
fever, because I didn't want<lb/>
to give you any worry, especially<lb/>
as I wasn't myself taking<lb/>
any risks whatever- There<lb/>
have been two or three <add>cases</add> in<lb/>
Quemados since our ar-<lb/>
rival - one a member of the<lb/>
hospital Corps, and another<lb/>
a female nurse, both of whom<lb/>
were nursing Mrs. Edmunds<lb/>
who was down with the dis-<lb/>
ease in an infected house<lb/>
in Quemados. These cases are<lb/>
now convalescing- Dr Kean is<lb/>
over his attack and should<lb/>
be in New Jersey by this<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02055003"/>
time, as he left Havana several<lb/>
days ago- Dr Carrol &amp; I have<lb/>
been studying some cultures<lb/>
which were made from the blood<lb/>
of yellow <add>fever</add>, but there isn't a par-<lb/>
ticle of danger in this- Please don't<lb/>
pay any attention to anything you<lb/>
see in the papers, for they always<lb/>
get everything wrong- I couldn't<lb/>
be in a safer place on the Island<lb/>
than at Camp Columbia- By Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi><lb/>
Lee's order, all Americans had al-<lb/>
ready moved out of Quemados<lb/>
before we got here- no soldier<lb/>
is allowed to enter the town-<lb/>
and no case has occurred for<lb/>
about two weeks- The last,<lb/>
I am told, was that of a Spanish<lb/>
boy who lived about 2 miles<lb/>
from here- When I get the dis-<lb/>
ease, I promise that a Cable-<lb/>
gram shall be promptly sent<lb/>
to you- In the meanwhile, please<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02055004"/>
don't worry one particle- We<lb/>
are not going into infected<lb/>
houses nor to see patients with<lb/>
the disease- we will confine our<lb/>
work to material that Dr Agramon<lb/>
te brings us- At present, there<lb/>
are about a dozen cases in Havana,<lb/>
but none of them at our disposal-<lb/>
So please rest easy as far as<lb/>
I am concerned- So you think,<lb/>
sweetheart, that I get up too<lb/>
early? well, I go to bed so early<lb/>
and the mornings are so beau-<lb/>
tiful that I can't resist the<lb/>
temptation of an early bath-<lb/>
You musn't forget that we have<lb/>
breakfast at 7 a.m.! I enjoy<lb/>
the early rising here very much,<lb/>
and expect to get into such a con-<lb/>
firmed habit, that I will be up<lb/>
&amp; chopping around in that aspara-<lb/>
gus bed before 5 o'clock, when<lb/>
I get back!- Boo! Boo! to you miss-<lb/>
Good-night, you sweet joy!</p>

<p><hi>Monday Morning</hi>-<hi>July 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>, Hello! lovie,<lb/>
dear, how are you this bright,<lb/>
beautiful morning? Why don't<lb/>
you get out of bed &amp; see the<lb/>
sun rise? It would be far<lb/>
better than snoozing away till<lb/>
7.30 o'clock! By the way, sweet<lb/>
farmer-lady, don't refer too<lb/>
often to the good things you<lb/>
have for breakfast, such<lb/>
as <hi>fried chicken</hi>, <hi>waffles</hi>,<lb/>
etc- We don't get those things<lb/>
here in any large quan-<lb/>
tity- I might say that we<lb/>
don't get them at all! The<lb/>
festive chicken doesn't ap-<lb/>
pear to flourish to any con-<lb/>
siderable extent on this Island.<lb/>
<hi>Fish</hi> are more plentiful-<lb/>
we get the <hi>Red Snapper</hi>, our<lb/>
old mobile friend, in perfection.<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02055006"/>
I think that Johnnie Mo<add>o</add>re built<lb/>
that piece of fence quite reas-<lb/>
onably- By all means, have him<lb/>
continue the fence down the<lb/>
lane to meet Mr Flohr's piece<lb/>
and then build your piece along<lb/>
the edge of grotto Park- Per-<lb/>
haps we will have stone enough<lb/>
left to build, one of these days<lb/>
on the other side of the road-<lb/>
Don't cut down any more<lb/>
trees, fat farmer-L, until<lb/>
I get back- I want to bend<lb/>
<hi>my large brain</hi> to that job!<lb/>
Your darling letter of July 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi><lb/>
tells me that the <hi>wind</hi> has<lb/>
stopped <hi>blowing</hi> and that it<lb/>
is much cooler- 52&deg; is certainly<lb/>
remarkable weather for July,<lb/>
even on the mountain- You<lb/>
will now have a chance to<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02055007"/>
recover from that &ldquo;<hi>washed<lb/>
out</hi>&rdquo; feeling! I can thoroughly<lb/>
sympathize with you, for there<lb/>
is nothing more annoying than<lb/>
a continuous wind- I do<lb/>
wish that you could have some<lb/>
of our delightful rains here-<lb/>
nearly every afternoon now<lb/>
we have a good shower-<lb/>
I think your strawberries<lb/>
did very well for the <hi>first</hi><lb/>
year- They will bear 3 times<lb/>
as many the second year, As<lb/>
a morning dish they came<lb/>
in very well after all- You<lb/>
say that <add>there</add> are 25 raspberries<lb/>
along the garden beds? I think<lb/>
that I put out 3 dozen,<lb/>
although I may be mistaken.<lb/>
Its surprising that there should<lb/>
be so few <hi>red</hi> raspberries<lb/>
amongst the lot, as I can-<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02055008"/>
got some of them- I intended<lb/>
to divide them amongst black &amp;<lb/>
red, with a few <hi>yellow</hi> thrown<lb/>
in for good luck- How nice<lb/>
to have the raspberries fol-<lb/>
low the strawberries, and later<lb/>
still to enjoy the black berries!<lb/>
I am so glad that my darling<lb/>
children can enjoy them for<lb/>
breakfast- Don't forget that the<lb/>
raspberry is decidedly consti-<lb/>
pating for some people- See<lb/>
that little big sweet Seventeen<lb/>
doesn't get in that way with-<lb/>
out saying anything about it-<lb/>
A little liquorice powder ought<lb/>
to remedy matters- I cannot<lb/>
believe that three weeks have<lb/>
passed since I left my pretty chil-<lb/>
dren! How the time has flown!<lb/>
By this time in August, I shall expect<lb/>
to be on my way back home.<lb/>
Am trying to get my laboratories in<lb/>
as good shape as possible- Well, here<lb/>
comes the mailman- Boo! Boo! sweet joys,<lb/>
Love &amp; Kisses for my pretty pinks-</p>
