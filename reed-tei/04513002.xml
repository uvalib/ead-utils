<salute>Dear Maria and Lydia:</salute>
</opener>
<p>We were sorry not to be able to say goodbye to you at the boat but we fully<lb/>
understood and know how vexatious it was for you to have been held up so long,<lb/>
two days in fact, doing the job that you were trying to finish. As the boat<lb/>
left the harbor, Mary and I saw a car and two women waved to us. We thought<lb/>
it might be you and vigorously waved back but we were not sure.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how much we appreciated all the kindness, hospitality<lb/>
and generosity which you bestowed in such full measures upon us. You are<lb/>
delightful hostesses friends and I do hope our paths cross often. I wouldn't<lb/>
wish for you to be here in Rochester as it is very cold with much snow<lb/>
today but I do hope that you can visit here non-professionally sometime.</p>
<p>On the train coming home I developed a severe cold from which I am just<lb/>
recovering. I leave today for Washington. I have a date to see General<lb/>
Grant and Mr. Rath next Monday. I am taking with me some pictures of the<lb/>
Finca San Jose which I took myself and I will let you know on my return all<lb/>
that I learn.</p>
<p>Would you kindly send to Mary the name and address of &ldquo;Fifi&rdquo; Tarafa. We came<lb/>
off without her address and do not know her real first name. In Havana I<lb/>
purchased a Cuban telephone book for just such purposes but could not find it<lb/>
listed, nor could I find listed the address of Mr. and Mrs. Aosborne Hill.<lb/>
Incidentally, I am afraid that Mary and I made several faux pas. When we were<lb/>
first introduced to him I thought his name was a hyphenated English name -<lb/>
Aosborne-Hill and I am sure that on several occasions Mary and I called<lb/>
them Mr. and Mrs. Aosborne. Apparently I am wrong and Aosborne is his first<lb/>
name. Is that correct? I should like to drop him a note.</p>
<p>I do hope that Mr. Massaguer will be good enough to send Mary the cartoon<lb/>
which he made of her. If you do not hear from him would you kindly send<lb/>
me his address. I don't know that he would answer a request of mine any more<lb/>
than one from you but I can try.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
