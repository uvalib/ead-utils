<salute>Dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I decided to write and send you this with<lb/>
my letter.</p>
<p>I became interested in that mix-up of Spanish names at Camp<lb/>
Lazear. I saw the real names long ago and since then wondered<lb/>
where the name Martinez came from. Of course, it does not<lb/>
matter at this late date, and does not affect your cost-sheet<lb/>
figures, but I was curious to learn how it happened.</p>
<p>You see, no one has produced factual evidence of any kind that<lb/>
there was a man named Martinez there. I don't consider Senate<lb/>
Document of 1911 accurate on all p<del><unclear>r</unclear></del>oints.</p>
<p>I look at my photostat of S. &amp; W. (List of Patients) and see<lb/>
there two named Fernandez. I cannot imagine any Army clerk,<lb/>
(and looking at it I see he was an efficient one, probably<lb/>
Moran) carrying two men of identical last names on a record<lb/>
for three months unless it was correct. If I was that clerk<lb/>
it could not have happened, and from this paper, he was a<lb/>
better one than I was.</p>
<p>Then, Doctor Ames saw this <unclear>report</unclear> frequently and when it was<lb/>
completed it was officialy signed by him. He and that clerk<lb/>
would have know for certain about those names and what ex-<lb/>
periments they took.</p>
<p>Then, I cannot think of Major Reed authorizing checks to two<lb/>
men both named Fernandez, and Major Kean so making them out<lb/>
unless it was correct. If there was any reason to change a<lb/>
check, he would have issued a new one and marked one stub as<lb/>
void, which, evidently, was not done.</p>
<p>So, I got Lambert's new address and wrote to him, the only<lb/>
man alive today who could know anything about it first-hand,<lb/>
simply asking him if a man named Martinez had been treated by<lb/>
him and had there been more than one Fernandez. I did not tell<lb/>
him why I wished to know.</p>
<p>He replied as follows, Quote: &ldquo;Nicines Fernandez was 4th case,<lb/>
and Jose M. (for Martinez) Fernandez was 6th case. His friends<lb/>
always called him by his middle name--Martinez--and I did the<lb/>
same so as not to get them or the records mixed. I have seen<lb/>
many writings where Martinez was used as his last name. If you<lb/>
asked Mrs. Jernegan whose blood her husband took, she would<lb/>
say, &ldquo;Martinez,&rdquo; because that is the only name Jernegan and<lb/>
others knew him by, but his last name was Fernandez, same as<lb/>
Nicines was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only thing wrong with that is that the initial of the 6th case<lb/>
on the Epidemic Report for the Surg. Gens. Office was not an<lb/>
M, but an N! And I would not think cases would be mixed on<lb/>
the record, as Lambert says, for <hi>Nicomar</hi> was entered as cured<lb/>
just one day after Jose entered, but he may have been held in<lb/>
hospital. Dr. Ames held some Spanish cases over to cheer up<lb/>
their friends. But despite this inaccuracy, I do not think<lb/>
that any man bearing the last name of Martinez was ever treated<lb/>
there--Too much evidence against it. Of course, all this don't<lb/>
amount to anything serious anyway, but it amuses me to track<lb/>
it down, and it may give you some different ideas.</p>
<p>There <unclear>$50 check</unclear> to Martinez was evidently endorsed by him that <unclear>way</unclear>.<lb/>
There <unclear>checks</unclear> were <unclear>cashed</unclear> &amp; money turned <unclear>out</unclear> to them.</p>
