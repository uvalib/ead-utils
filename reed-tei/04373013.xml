Dr. Currier McEwen, Dean<lb/>
New York University College of Medicine<lb/>
477 First Avenue<lb/>
New York 16, New York<lb/>
<salute>My dear Currier:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I hope that the telegram which Mr. John Wheldon asked me to send on<lb/>
the occasion of Walter Reed's 100th birthday party at your institution<lb/>
was satisfactory.</p>
<p>There is one piece of unfinished business. It is curious that some of<lb/>
the dates of Walter Reed's early educational activities are clouded.<lb/>
Fortunately for me I have his actual diplomas presented to me by the<lb/>
Reed family. Mr. Wheldon spoke of Reed as a member of the class of '97.<lb/>
This was obviously an error. Later he corrected it and stated it was<lb/>
of the class of Bellevue '73. As per my letter to Dr. Jacobson, published<lb/>
in the Brooklyn Hospital Journal, April-June, 1949, page 83, I was under<lb/>
the impression that Reed graduated from Bellevue on October 1, 1872, not<lb/>
1873. After sending you the wire, I checked on this. I have his Bellevue<lb/>
diploma in my safe and without question he got his second degree of doctor<lb/>
of medicine from Bellevue on October 1, 1872, regardless of what he may or<lb/>
may not have continued to do at Bellevue.</p>
<p>Does your institution have a photograph of this diploma? Would you like<lb/>
to have one? I should be glad to have a photograph of it made for you<lb/>
and present it to you or to the institution or both with my best wishes<lb/>
(but I do think that the Bellevue records should be corrected). In return<lb/>
for it I would like to know what he might have done in 1873, if he continued<lb/>
some activity there.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>

P.S.: I have just received your letter of September 14. Thank you very<lb/>
much for your kind thoughts regarding our daughter Mary. The wedding was<lb/>
very nice.<lb/>
