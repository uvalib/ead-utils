Handwritten letter to Gen Truby<lb/>
<dateline>
<date value="1941-03-08">3&sol;8&sol;41</date>
</dateline>
<salute>My dear Gen Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am most grateful to you for sending me such a fine letter<lb/>
to take to Dr Ramos I am sure that, in conjunction with<lb/>
one I just received from Gen Kean, it will help me greatly<lb/>
in Havana. With the weight of your authority behind me I<lb/>
believe, or at least hope that the Cubans will graciously<lb/>
accept my evidence &amp; that we can get together to memoralize<lb/>
the sites accurately, for the greater glory of all concerned,<lb/>
assuredly including Finlay.</p>
<p>I enclose a carbon copy of Gen. Kean's letter, also<lb/>
received this morning. It was written in long hand.<lb/>
You will note that he says &ldquo;I am also familiar with the<lb/>
location <hi>southwest</hi> of the Military Hospital where was<lb/>
located&rdquo;.... etc. I am taking the <unclear>[unclear]</unclear> of calling your<lb/>
attention to his statement <hi>southwest</hi>&rdquo;. In your letter you<lb/>
state in the 4th paragraph &ldquo;... our yellow fever wards<lb/>
near the <hi>north western</hi> border of the hospital grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am so anxious to avoid growing Ramos, <unclear>Lage</unclear> et<lb/>
al any opportunity for picking flaws in our argument<lb/>
&amp; wondered if you were willing to change your letter a<lb/>
bit on that direction. I realize that there is some doubt<lb/>
in your mind as to whether the memorial fence, sign &amp; tree<lb/>
(false site) are exactly where the yellow fever wards were<lb/>
or whether the latter were somewhat nearer the ocean<lb/>
(more north west) from the fence &amp; sign. But if you consult<lb/>
that enclosed little note &amp; also (if you still have it) the 1902<lb/>
U S Army map of camp Columbia. I think we must<lb/>
say that the yellow fever wards were more accurately<lb/>
<hi>southwest</hi> or certainly <hi>west</hi> of the Post hospital rather<lb/>
than northwest. I hate to bother you over such a small<lb/>
point but as I haven't yet received my reports back<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06302023"/>
from Moran and Mrs Agramonte from Havana I think I<lb/>
have time to send your letter back for your correction on that<lb/>
point. To save you from copying the letter all over<lb/>
I am returning the original (keeping the carbons) &amp; you<lb/>
could just change that one word <unclear>[unclear]</unclear> to southwest<lb/>
or to were as your conscience dictates.</p>
<p>By the way you recall we had a little discussion<lb/>
also which direction was moved in relation to the<lb/>
office's quarters (bachelor) Even before I had these 1902 &amp;<lb/>
1907 U S Army map I submitted your drawing of its camp<lb/>
grounds (a photostat of it) to Gen Kean without mentioning<lb/>
the directions to him. He wrote that he thought your map<lb/> 
was essentially correct except that the direction sign<lb/>
wasn't quite right. I can see how one would naturally<lb/>
consider the oceon &amp; La Playa &ldquo;north&rdquo; of the<lb/>
hospital when in reality it was northwest.</p>
<p>Again let me say how much I appreciate your<lb/>
wonderful help &amp; <unclear>[unclear]</unclear> your <unclear>[unclear]</unclear></p>
