<salute>My darling Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am, once more,<lb/>
upon my &ldquo;native heath,&rdquo; and<lb/>
have taken the first opportunity<lb/>
of writing to you. In my last, writ-<lb/>
ten from the Cosmopolitan Hotel,<lb/>
I promised to write on Monday,<lb/>
but when Monday came, I found<lb/>
so many matters requiring my<lb/>
attention that I was compelled<lb/>
to forego the pleasure. Let me<lb/>
give you a brief outline of<lb/>
my meandering since I wrote.<lb/>
Sunday afternoon, I visited<lb/>
Pier 1, East River, intending to<lb/>
embark for Govenor's Is-<lb/>
land, in order to see our<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01637002"/>
friend, Dr Hoff. On reaching the<lb/>
Steamboat, however, I found that<lb/>
Dr H. no longer resided on the Is-<lb/>
land, so that I had to trudge back<lb/>
to my Hotel, fruitless. In vain,I<lb/>
tried to find some way by<lb/>
which I could reach my Post.<lb/>
Thinking that I might get some<lb/>
information in Brooklyn, I went<lb/>
over the same afternoon &amp; called<lb/>
on my old doctor-friends at the<lb/>
City Hospital- They received<lb/>
me cordially -- in fact &ldquo;knew<lb/>
me from afar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ran to&rdquo;<lb/>
me, but did not &ldquo;fall on<lb/>
my neck,&rdquo; probably because they<lb/>
knew that I did not allow such<lb/>
familiarities. Notwithstanding<lb/>
their friendship, they could not<lb/>
tell me how I could reach<lb/>
Willet's Point- After spending<lb/>
a few pleasant hours with<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01637003"/>
them, swaying to &amp; fro, under a<lb/>
green elm, in a hammock,<lb/>
I returned to my hotel- After<lb/>
supper, went again to Brooklyn<lb/>
to see my friends Mr &amp; Mrs. Deck-<lb/>
er, No. 235 G. 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> st., where I<lb/>
used to board, you'll remember-<lb/>
They were very glad to see me<lb/>
&amp; insisted upon my spending<lb/>
the night with them -- said<lb/>
they would put my old <add>room</add> at my<lb/>
<del>my</del> service &amp; treat me to a<lb/>
nice breakfast. To all <add>of</add> these<lb/>
entreaties,however, I turned<lb/>
a deaf ear, but they would<lb/>
not let me leave till I had<lb/>
promised to make their house<lb/>
my headquarters whenever<lb/>
I came to the city. I returned<lb/>
from Brooklyn about 9.30<lb/>
P.M. &amp; as I crossed the E. Riv-<lb/>
er, what do you suppose<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01637004"/>
<del>do</del> I saw? I was standing on<lb/>
the forward deck, the night was<lb/>
very bright &amp; the Heavens beau-<lb/>
tiful. Now what do you think<lb/>
would attract my attention at<lb/>
such a time? Who do you suppose<lb/>
claimed my thoughts? Ah! you<lb/>
sweet little angel! 'Twas<lb/>
Jupiter that attracted my gaze<lb/>
&amp; of <hi>you</hi> I thought- There I<lb/>
was, floating between two<lb/>
giant cities -- a mighty tum-<lb/>
ult all around me; but<lb/>
in the midst of these discor-<lb/>
dant sounds, my thoughts were<lb/>
500 miles away &amp; I only saw<lb/>
your sweet face, &amp; heard <del>the</del><lb/>
your gentle voice!</p>
<p>But I must hasten on--<lb/>
Early yesterday morning, I<lb/>
repaired to Army Headquar-<lb/>
ters &amp; there learned that I could<lb/>
take the North Shore R.R. of<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01637005"/>
Long Island &amp; come to a<lb/>
town called Whitestone, only<lb/>
3 miles from the Post. I there<lb/>
heard also that my good<lb/>
friend Dr Torney had been<lb/>
stationed at Fort Wood<lb/>
N.Y. Harbor &amp; was stopping<lb/>
at the Stephens Hotel- You<lb/>
should have seen how I<lb/>
&ldquo;rushed frantically&rdquo; forth<lb/>
&amp; with a voice of thunder<lb/>
hailed the first stage- In<lb/>
a short time I was at the<lb/>
Stephens Hotel, but just in<lb/>
time to be too late- Dr T. had<lb/>
just paid his<del>s</del> bill &amp; gone<lb/>
to his post- I bewailed my<lb/>
fate &amp; wended my way<lb/>
quickly to my Hotel. I will<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01637006"/>
see the Dr in a few days, as<lb/>
he is stationed very near<lb/>
the city. After dinner, I went<lb/>
out &amp; had my baggage checked,<lb/>
and took a hack for James'<lb/>
slip, &amp; thence by boat to<lb/>
Hunter's Point, L.I. City,&amp;<lb/>
from there to Whitestone by<lb/>
rail- At the latter place, I<lb/>
met the Senior Surgeon of the<lb/>
Post &amp; rode out with him-<lb/>
He is very pleasant &amp; I<lb/>
am especially glad of it, as<lb/>
I am quartered in the same<lb/>
house with him. At dinner<lb/>
(6.P.M.) I met two Captains &amp; 2<lb/>
second lieutenants- They, with<lb/>
the surgeon &amp; myself, form<lb/>
what is known as the &ldquo;bach-<lb/>
elor&rdquo; mess- I must confess<lb/>
that I do not like the term,<lb/>
as it implies that I am an<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01637007"/>
old bachelor, a thing which<lb/>
I never intend to be. We had<lb/>
a good <del>supper</del><add>Dinner</add> &amp; I ate hear-<lb/>
tily- After dinner, I went<lb/>
to the Commanding Officer's<lb/>
Residence, to report for duty-<lb/>
(I had already donned my mil-<lb/>
itaries, so as to make a<lb/>
good appearance) Dr Byrne,<lb/>
the Surgeon, escorted me, &amp; I<lb/>
was soon in the presence<lb/>
of General Abbott. By the<lb/>
way, I found him to be one<lb/>
of the most pleasant gentle-<lb/>
man I ever met with.</p>
<p>Leaving the General's house,<lb/>
we visited the Hospital,<lb/>
being saluted on the way<lb/>
by about 40 soldiers-<lb/>
You should have seen<lb/>
me returning the salute.<lb/>
I did it in grand style-<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01637008"/>
After seeing a few patients, I<lb/>
returned to my residence &amp; was<lb/>
soon asleep- This morning, I<lb/>
have been busy writing my<lb/>
letters to the Surgeon General-<lb/>
I am free to say that I am more<lb/>
than pleased with my post &amp;<lb/>
only hope that I can remain<lb/>
here the remainder of the year.<lb/>
In my next letter, I'll give you<lb/>
a description of the post, etc.<lb/>
I forgot to say that we have<lb/>
a most excellent band of music<lb/>
which plays 3 times a day.<lb/>
As soon as I heard it, last<lb/>
night, I <hi>thought of you</hi>! would<lb/>
that I could send you a few<lb/>
of its strains!</p>
<p>Will write again on Thursday.<lb/>
Answer as soon as you get<lb/>
this -- Address Dr W. Reed, U.S.A.<lb/>
Willet's Point, N.Y. Harbor, &amp; believe me</p>
<closer>
<salute>fondly &amp; devotedly, yours,</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
Kind regards to all your family, including the Dr &amp; wife,<lb/>
Your mother, Mrs. Harrell etc-<lb/>
