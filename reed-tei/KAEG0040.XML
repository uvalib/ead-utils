<title>Letter from Jefferson Randolph Kean to Harry Clemons, November 28, 1939</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Kean mentions to Clemons his book review of &ldquo;William Crawford Gorgas: His Life and Work,&rdquo; and states that the book clearly indicates Gorgas as the originator of methods to eradicate mosquitoes, when in fact Howard was responsible for these measures. Kean is quite upset over the unwillingness of the author of the book to change the facts. [Courtesy of The Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia Library]</p>

Mr. Harry Clemons, Librarian, Univ. Va.<lb/>

<p>I would like to add to the Walter Reed<lb/>
file of MSS in the Library an editorial book review<lb/>
of the biography <hi>William Crawford Gorgas</hi>: His life and<lb/>
work, <hi>by Marie D. Gorgas and Burton J. Hendrick</hi><lb/>
Garden City N. Y. Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. 1924.<lb/>
It has an important bearing on Walter Reed's work<lb/>
on yellow fever as you will see from the follow-<lb/>
ing statement. Some months before my retire-<lb/>
ment, while I was Chief Surgeon First Corps Area stationed<lb/>
at Boston, I received in the same mail (March 30, 1924)<lb/>
two letters, one from the Surgeon General of the Army,<lb/>
Gen. Ireland, the other from Mrs. Walter Reed, both com-<lb/>
plaining of an article which had just appeared in the<lb/>
magazine The World's Work. It was a chapter from a<lb/>
biography of Gorgas then being written by Burton J.<lb/>
Hendrick and Mrs. Gorgas, in which was given a very<lb/>
brief and imperfect account of the work of the Reed<lb/>
Board in Cuba in 1900-1901 and the subsequent work<lb/>
of Gorgas against mosquitoes in Havana beginning<lb/>
in March 1901. It stated that when Reed had<lb/>
demonstrated the fact that mosquitoes were the carriers<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fKAEG0050"/>
Walter Reed &amp; Yellow Fever<lb/>
2.<lb/>
of yellow fever it seemed to him just a laboratory<lb/>
demonstration that did not lead anywhere, as he<lb/>
did not know any way of combatting this tiny<lb/>
winged enemy, and things looked as hopely<lb/>
as ever, until Gorgas came along and by his success-<lb/>
ful warfare against the mosquito, became the real<lb/>
demonstrator of the fact that yellow fever was a<lb/>
mosquito-borne disease! Both the Surgeon General<lb/>
and Mrs. Reed declared that I was the person to<lb/>
take the matter up with Mr. Hendrick and obtain<lb/>
an authoritative correction of this astonishing mis-<lb/>
statement. This was an easy thing to do. Reed had<lb/>
announced his findings in a paper read at the<lb/>
Pan American Medical Congress which met at<lb/>
Havana Feb. 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1901, and ended it with eleven<lb/>
conclusions, none of which has been shaken to this<lb/>
day. The 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> conclusion was as follows:</p>
<p>10. &ldquo;The spread of yellow fever can be most effectually<lb/>
controlled by measures directed to the destruction of<lb/>
mosquitoes and the protection of the sick against the<lb/>
bites of these insects.&rdquo; The older army medical<lb/>
officers in Cuba were quite familiar with the means<lb/>
of combatting mosquitoes which we had learned from<lb/>
the publications of Dr. L. O. Howard, Chief of the<lb/>
Bureau of Entomology, some years before, and in fact<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fKAEG0060"/>
Walter Reed &amp; Yellow Fever.<lb/>
3.<lb/>
the same procedures which Gorgas subsequently used<lb/>
in Havana had been in use in the neighboring town<lb/>
of Marianao since the year before, and in fact this war-<lb/>
fare had been directed officially by Gen. Order No. 6<lb/>
Hdqrs of Cuba <hi>in Dec. 1900</hi>. I wrote a polite letter<lb/>
to Mr. Hendricks as editor of the world work, quoting<lb/>
authorities for these facts and asking him to pub-<lb/>
lish my statement in the next issue of the maga-<lb/>
zine. He did not do so and Gen. Ireland had it<lb/>
published in the New York Times of Sunday April 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
1924. We supposed however that he would rewrite this<lb/>
chapter before the book appeared in the autumn.<lb/>
But, incredible as it may seem, he did not do so<lb/>
and, when the biography appeared six months<lb/>
later, nothing had been corrected, in spite of the fact<lb/>
that I sent him in May a copy of a letter to me<lb/>
from Dr. L. O. Howard congratulating me on my<lb/>
letter to the <hi>Times</hi> and saying that he had received<lb/>
in January 1900 a letter from Reed showing that he<lb/>
knew exactly how the warfare against the mosquito<lb/>
should be carried out. When the book appeared<lb/>
with the misstatements all there, I undertook the<lb/>
review of it which I am sending you at the<lb/>
Surgeon General's request and he saw to it that<lb/>
it was widely distributed. I have understood that<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="fKAEG0070"/>
Walter Reed &amp; Yellow Fever.<lb/>
4<lb/>
this review killed the sale of the book, as it<lb/>
should have, for nothing would have shock-<lb/>
ed General Gorgas more than this effort to<lb/>
filch Reed's laurels. It was reported that Mrs.<lb/>
Gorgas also protested, but was told that they<lb/>
were &ldquo;writing the story of Gorgas and not of<lb/>
Reed&rdquo;. I think the trouble with Mr. Hendrick<lb/>
is that he is more of a newspaper man than a<lb/>
historian at heart and values the story more<lb/>
that the facts. The chapter which he publish-<lb/>
ed in advance in the World's Work and which<lb/>
he called &ldquo;Yellow Fever meets its Master&rdquo; would<lb/>
have been quite spoiled if he had changed it<lb/>
to accord with the truth. So he thought he would<lb/>
take chances on it and let it go. He had plenty<lb/>
of time to make these corrections as his attention<lb/>
was called to them in April and the book did<lb/>
not appear until late in the autumn.</p>
<p>I have inclosed also several other papers for<lb/>
this file. A list of Incorporation of the Walter Reed<lb/>
Memorial Assn, organized in 1903, with excerpts<lb/>
referring to his work. The interest on the fund raised<lb/>
by this Assn has been used to supplement Mrs. Reeds<lb/>
pension. The letter from Dr. L. O. Howard refers to the<lb/>
Review.</p>
