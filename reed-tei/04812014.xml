The President and Counsellors<lb/>
Academy of Sciences<lb/>
Habana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>Gentlemen:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciate very greatly the opportunity to obtain a microfilm of the Finlay day-<lb/>
books which have been deposited in your library. These will give very important<lb/>
data to anyone who is interested in the life of this great scientist.</p>
<p>As you know, I am writing a book (and have given and will continue to give lectures)<lb/>
on the conquest of yellow fever. I have always tried to do full justice to Doctor<lb/>
Finlay whose magnificent work was quite indispensable. For five or six years, I have<lb/>
held up the writing of my book until I could have this all-important data on Doctor<lb/>
Finlay. One simply cannot write on the conquest of yellow fever without knowing<lb/>
everything possible about Doctor Finlay and his remarkable observations and con-<lb/>
clusions.</p>
<p>As I wrote to your previous President, when I first made this request, I believe that<lb/>
one copy of this microfilm should be deposited in your own library just in case any-<lb/>
thing should happen to the original films and I am asking that such a copy be made<lb/>
and I should like the privilege of paying for it and presenting it to your library<lb/>
as a very small token of my appreciation.</p>
<p>When, a few years ago, I told the Surgeon General of the United States Army of these<lb/>
Finlay data, he was very eager to have a copy of the microfilm in the Library of<lb/>
the Surgeon General so that it might be available to all American scientists and<lb/>
historians and also to members of the United States Congress. I have therefore asked<lb/>
that an extra copy of the microfilm be made available for me so that I may present it<lb/>
to the Surgeon General.</p>
<p>Because of the intense interest which Dr. Pedro Nogueira has had in the life and ac-<lb/>
complishments of Doctor Finlay and because it was he who first told me of the day-<lb/>
books, I should like to present to him also a copy of the microfilm. In other words,<lb/>
now that you have been so gracious as to grant me permission to have the data micro-<lb/>
filmed, I should like to have not one but four copies made at my expense: One for<lb/>
your library, one for the Surgeon General of the United States Army, one for Doctor<lb/>
Nogueira and one for me, which latter copy will be deposited in the Library of the<lb/>
Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>Please accept, dear sirs, my sincere appreciation for your cooperation in this matter.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
