Dr. P. S. Hench,<lb/>
Mayo Clinic,<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I regret to inform you that I will not be mentally or physically<lb/>
able to go through the records of my husband's father, Dr. James<lb/>
Carroll when you come to Washington this month.</p>
<p>Time, which is said to be a great healer has done nothing for me<lb/>
so far. I am worse now than when my husband passed away for the<lb/>
loneliness is almost more than I can endure. I am not socially<lb/>
inclined and go very little and I think my relatives are a little<lb/>
weary of hearing me talk about my loss. Most people are too<lb/>
wrapped up in their own affairs to bother much about the woes of<lb/>
others, so I have become discouraged, despondent and have lost the<lb/>
will to live. I keep to myself as much as possible and watch TV.</p>
<p>I have not yet located the keys to open the trunks. For some<lb/>
reason or other, I never bothered to ask my husband which keys were<lb/>
which. He has a number of them among his possessions and some<lb/>
day, maybe months from now, I will be able to go through the things<lb/>
without going all to pieces. Just now, I am too emotionally unstable<lb/>
and another thing the basement is so cold that I cannot spend much<lb/>
time there as I am having a flare-up of arthritis and try to spend<lb/>
my time in a warm place.</p>
<p>I have not made any decision about the <unclear>operation</unclear> on my feet but<lb/>
they are very sore and deformed. Dr. Gibson suggested the operation<lb/>
but my family Dr. says at my age to let well enough alone. He thinks<lb/>
that if I have gotten along so far, it is too late in life to take the<lb/>
risk. So you see when one gets conflicting opinions it is difficult<lb/>
to make a decision. I have stopped all treatments for the time being<lb/>
for I am too despondent to care what happens to me.</p>
<p>Some day I may have a different out-look on life but until then,<lb/>
I will not be able to help you with the records. I do not think I<lb/>
will be here the week of February 17 as I may go to Pennsylvania for<lb/>
a couple of weeks in an effort to forget my troubles.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
<signed>Mrs. George S. H. Carroll,<lb/>
2814 Rhode Island Avenue, N. E.,<lb/>
Washington 18, D. C.</signed>
