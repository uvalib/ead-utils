<salute>Dear Dr Maxcy:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am not purposing to bother you with any new problems,<lb/>
nor indeed have I time to set them forth to you, &amp; yet since<lb/>
you are interested with &ldquo;<hi>Indices of Mal. Infec'n</hi>&rdquo; here is a piece<lb/>
of datum which sh'd interest you &amp; which you might keep<lb/>
in mind in case it may help to explain something that<lb/>
comes up.</p>
<p>1) In the latter part of Nov. 1914, von Ezdorf <del>in</del><add>took</add> 1660 - thick<lb/>
films, at Scott Miss: Mayne - then Mitzmain - from the<lb/>
same community took 1184. The first gave 41.11% +;<lb/>
the second 39.9% +; practically the same figure. Both <unclear>same</unclear><lb/>
men competent &amp; the number examined large enough to exclude accidental errors.</p>
<p>Von E. considered that his index was taken after the close<lb/>
of the malaria season- i.e. that there would be no new in-<lb/>
fections there after. Of this I am not sure; hibernation is<lb/>
intermittent in this section &amp; mosquitoes <hi>infective</hi><lb/>
when cold weather came on might well infect<lb/>
<del><unclear>w</unclear></del> if they fed during warm days in December.<lb/>
<unclear>Wenyon</unclear> has shown that a short hibernation- a matter<lb/>
of days or it may be of a couple of weeks - does not <del><unclear>(in the</unclear></del><lb/>
<unclear>(About Salonica)</unclear> <del>I</del><add>always</add> sterilize Anopheles. I judge however,<lb/>
from what I know of von E., that his statement was so<lb/>
near<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01018024"/>
2. Maxcy.<lb/>
near right that we can say - very <hi>few</hi> were infected after<lb/>
his index. Let us disregard them, as negligible.</p>
<p>Mayne's <del>is</del> belief that in his index <add>were</add> none who were <add>not</add> infec-<lb/>
ted <del>by the spring brood-whether of hibernated females.</del><add>in the previous winter</add><lb/>
<del>or the newly developed ones</del>- is I think, absolutely true.<lb/>
He found no <del>inf</del> Anopheles infected- out of 1211 dissected<lb/>
up to May 14 <add><del>where</del> the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> infected one found May 15</add>. This finding is a amply confirmed by simi-<lb/>
lar observations by Mayne, later at Talladega springs &amp;<lb/>
(I think) at <unclear>Monroe La:</unclear> &amp; by King &amp; Von Dine at <unclear>Mound La</unclear><lb/>
Anopheles in that section do <del>not</del> carry the parasite over<lb/>
the winter</p>
<p>Now these indices being practically the same, it is evident<lb/>
(1) that approximately all the men who were + in Nov. were<lb/>
+ in Feb. &amp; that all who were - in Nov: were - in Feb.<lb/>
or (2) that about the same number who changed from<lb/>
+ to - in the interval made the contrary change<lb/>
from - to +.</p>
<p>Now among those examined by M. there was a record<lb/>
of 103 found + by von E., Of these M. found 48 + &amp;<lb/>
55 - <add>(<hi>47% &amp; 53% respectively</hi>)</add> This number, 103 is too small to justify us in<lb/>
considering it as representative of the community.<lb/>
If <del>we did</del> it was it would imply that approximatly<lb/>
50% <add>(53% really)</add> of those not <add>found</add> + in the fall <del>w</del> became so in the spring!<lb/>
Allowing for new comers &amp; some infections after V. E. Index, if w'd<lb/>
show a very large percentage of infections, not patent to a<lb/>
careful blood exam'n by competent men<lb/>
<del>in the fall</del><lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01018025"/>
3<lb/>
Men in the fall of 1914.</p>
<p>Of course we have long known that all mal. infections<lb/>
were not discoverable by blood examinations. This<lb/>
was well shown by same of Geiger's work at Lanoke <add>during the winter of 1918</add> &amp; in<lb/>
deed on this belief depends the use of the <unclear>provaca-<lb/>
tive</unclear> intra-venous injection of various foreign <unclear>proteids</unclear><lb/>
I do not think however that it was held that a large<lb/>
% age escaped discovery. Koch's Stephansort, steriliza-<lb/>
tion of <unclear>carried</unclear> was based on the doctrine - which<lb/>
Koch affirmed - that if parasites were not found on a<lb/>
careful examination of the blood, the man was free<lb/>
from infection. The same, I <hi>think</hi> (am not <unclear>so positive of this</unclear>)<lb/>
was the contention of Bass in his Bolivar Co. Campaign<lb/>
in 1916. I <hi>think</hi> that he only gave quinine to those<lb/>
whose blood<del>s</del> he found +. (Later, in Sunflower Co. he<lb/>
gave quinine to these <hi>and also</hi> to all others who had<lb/>
had malaria the previous year).</p>
<p>It is then this <hi>considerable</hi>, or <hi>large</hi>, % age of <hi>infections</hi><lb/>
missed by even a careful blood examination -thick<lb/>
films- &amp; in the hands of careful men which I would<lb/>
bring to your attention. It may be well to bear<lb/>
it in mind</p>
<p>I attempted to get other data on this subject- i.e. the<lb/>
spontaneous change from patent to latent <del>&amp; vi</del> in-<lb/>
fection of the blood &amp; vice versa; but <del>secured none</del><lb/>
of</p>
