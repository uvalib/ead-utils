<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of June 9. reached<lb/>
me this morning. I enjoyed it very much,<lb/>
as I do all your letters. The pleasure<lb/>
of getting letters is increased by<lb/>
the distance we are apart.</p>
<p>It sometimes seems very peculiar<lb/>
to be a foreigner. There are always<lb/>
Americans here, I can often<lb/>
spot them. Some of the hotels here<lb/>
fly an American flag in order<lb/>
to attract American tourists,<lb/>
that seems rather ridiculous.<lb/>
When we buy things here we<lb/>
always have to try to conceal<lb/>
our nationality in order not to<lb/>
be charged double prices Americans<lb/>
are all considered to be rich.</p>
<p>It is very strange that the Lyons<lb/>
behave badly to Gus Murdoch, I<lb/>
have no doubt both he and<lb/>
May, will be glad when they <del>had</del><lb/>
are married and are rid of the<lb/>
whole lot.</p>
<p>I can hardly imagine that you have<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00137002"/>
hot weather. It has been cool<lb/>
here all along. I am now entirely<lb/>
used to it, and never wear an<lb/>
overcoat. The temperature is very<lb/>
even but it rains a great deal<lb/>
almost every day. I did not<lb/>
know that the candy here was<lb/>
good. I will proceed to sample<lb/>
some of it. As to Edinburgh<lb/>
growing on you, I cannot say<lb/>
that I have experienced such<lb/>
a feeling. A certain section of<lb/>
the town is very beautiful. Hand-<lb/>
some cottages with large grounds<lb/>
surrounded by high walls, narrow<lb/>
lanes running between them. I<lb/>
never tire of that part of the town<lb/>
but I appreciated it perfectly<lb/>
the first time I saw it. The<lb/>
rest of the town including<lb/>
the principal streets is very<lb/>
tiresome. Princes St. is the great<lb/>
street of the town, along our<lb/>
side are the large shops, hotels<lb/>
etc, and on the other there is<lb/>
a park with some monuments.<lb/>
That sounds as though it might<lb/>
be pretty but somehow the effect<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00137003"/>
does not please me and this street<lb/>
<unclear>bores</unclear> me more than any other.<lb/>
I had always heard that<lb/>
sensational advertisements<lb/>
were peculiarly American but<lb/>
I have <add>seen</add> some here that beat<lb/>
anything on the other side<lb/>
There is a grocer here who<lb/>
sends around a regular army<lb/>
of &ldquo;sandwich-men&rdquo; dressed<lb/>
in most gorgeous uniforms<lb/>
some on foot and some on<lb/>
horseback there are thirty odd<lb/>
of them.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Lord Mayor of<lb/>
London made a state visit to<lb/>
Edinburgh to see the exhibition<lb/>
and I was fortunate enough<lb/>
to see him in <add>his</add> coach. In the<lb/>
distance I thought it was<lb/>
a fire engine. There was<lb/>
a man riding ahead and one<lb/>
behind. Then there was a coachman<lb/>
and two footmen in knee-breeches<lb/>
white stockings and powdered wig<lb/>
according to the old custom.<lb/>
The Lord mayors <del>him</del> self is a big<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00137004"/>
intelligent looking old gentleman<lb/>
He is a Jew and his name is Sir<lb/>
Henry Isaacs.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that Charley<lb/>
Orr is coming over, I hope that<lb/>
I shall meet him. I know he<lb/>
will enjoy the trip for he is<lb/>
a very observant traveller.</p>
<p>The instructors in the Anatomy<lb/>
department here are very fine men<lb/>
and thy have been remarkably<lb/>
Kind to us. We had an examination<lb/>
yesterday on the Thorax. They gave<lb/>
us a special examination as<lb/>
the regular one had been held before<lb/>
we came, and one of the demon-<lb/>
strators volunteered to give us<lb/>
a quiz beforehand on the subject.<lb/>
He talked to us for over two hours<lb/>
and gave us some very valuable<lb/>
instruction. There was no necessity<lb/>
for him to do this and he only<lb/>
did it because he liked it.<lb/>
They all have the air of teaching<lb/>
not because they are employed<lb/>
to do so but because they<lb/>
would rather do it than do<lb/>
anything else, <del>They</del> I should<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00137005"/>
think that they would get very<lb/>
tired and discouraged, as the<lb/>
students are terribly dull, but<lb/>
they never <del>loose</del> lose patience<lb/>
nor seem annoyed at all.<lb/>
They are nearly all Englishmen;<lb/>
in fact all but one and he<lb/>
is an Irishman, Poor Scotland.</p>
<p>Wednesday June 25</p>
<p>Nothing has occurred worthy of<lb/>
note since I wrote last night.</p>
