<title>Letter from John R. Taylor to Philip Showalter Hench, December 5, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Taylor enjoyed Hench's &ldquo;Conquest of Yellow Fever&rdquo; and sees nothing in it to correct. He claims that Finlay wrote about the Aedes aegypti mosquito as a means of yellow fever transmission in 1881 and gave the method and technique for experimentation. He details his own involvement as a yellow fever volunteer.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>It was a pleasure for me to<lb/>
receive the copy of your article on the &ldquo;Conquest<lb/>
of Yellow Fever&rdquo;, as it will be a welcome addition<lb/>
to the literature I have on the subject. (I had<lb/>
previously received the picture of the <unclear>Conquerors</unclear><lb/>
of yellow fever in the <unclear>Jour Amer</unclear> Med Assoc.<lb/>
of which I am a subscriber.)</p>
<p>The picture is very good, not only for<lb/>
its artistic representation, but the succeeding<lb/>
diagramatic numbering of the various personel,<lb/>
makes it doubly valuable, and reflects much<lb/>
credit on those who arranged it.</p>
<p>Will not go into all the persons<lb/>
represented, but just select one, that is, Dr Carlos<lb/>
J. Finlay. Am sure glad he was put on. It<lb/>
was my pleasure to work with him (also Carroll<lb/>
and Agramonte). While some parts of Finlay's<lb/>
theory and his work published in 1881 may<lb/>
be subject to criticism, yet it is a fact that<lb/>
at that time (1881) he stated that the microbe<lb/>
of yellow fever is transmitted from man to<lb/>
man by the bite of an insect, and that<lb/>
such an insect could be no other than the<lb/>
one we now call Aedes aegypti. You have<lb/>
probably read Finlays original (1881) article,<lb/>
or extracts of it, so will not go into detail,<lb/>
but will close it with the fact that Finlay<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03836002"/>
2<lb/>
2<lb/>
gave us the method of experimentation, with all<lb/>
the details of the technique upon which was<lb/>
founded the greatest advance in Tropical Medicine<lb/>
that the world ever knew.</p>
<p>This does not take away any of the credit<lb/>
due to the American Commission composed of<lb/>
Reed, Carroll, Lazear and Agramonte, they<lb/>
proved Finlay's theory. I worked with Carroll and<lb/>
Agramonte, but not with Reed, because he had to<lb/>
be in Washington, when the experiments were<lb/>
being conducted. (Glad you included the &ldquo;Gentlemen<lb/>
I salute you&rdquo; legend, that is not the only legend<lb/>
that got into public print.) Nor did I work<lb/>
for Lazear, because unfortunately he died<lb/>
very early during his work in Cuba</p>
<p>Now to your article, it is very good in<lb/>
every respect, and notwithstanding my long<lb/>
years of knowledge on the subject, I see<lb/>
nothing in your article to criticize</p>
<p>Am familiar with the experiments on<lb/>
John J. Moran. There seems to be a slight dif<lb/>
ference in the status of Moran at the time.<lb/>
The government reports state that he was a<lb/>
civilian clerk, employed at the headquarters<lb/>
of Gen Fitzhugh Lee at Quemados, while<lb/>
you state he was Acting Steward, Army<lb/>
Hospital Corps, however, this is a small item,<lb/>
and right or wrong, does not in any way<lb/>
affect Moran's willingness to volunteer<lb/>
without any expectation of reward.</p>

<p>I regret that Maj (later Gen) W. C. Gorgas<lb/>
could not have been included in the picture, but<lb/>
realize the reason.</p>
<p>Just a few words in regards to myself.<lb/>
I was called to Havana, Cuba, to take charge<lb/>
of the Inoculation Station of the Laboratory at<lb/>
Las Animas Hospital. During my service there<lb/>
a call was issued for volunteers to submit<lb/>
to being bitten by supposed yellow fever<lb/>
infected mosquitoes. It turned out to be a<lb/>
very risky test, because out of eight volun-<lb/>
teers, seven got yellow fever, and three of<lb/>
the seven died from the experiments,<lb/>
two Spaniards and one American nurse,<lb/>
Miss Clara Maas. I was lucky to recover<lb/>
from the experiment, and years later I<lb/>
find in the list of experiments published<lb/>
in the Congressional Record and other<lb/>
papers, that I was classed as an Englishman.<lb/>
although I was an American at the time<lb/>
and still am. <hi>The above refers to the<lb/>
experiments conducted by Gen Gorgas and<lb/>
Dr Guiteras</hi>. I was Chief of the Laboratory<lb/>
of the hospital at the time.</p>
<p>Sorry I did not get your other reprint. If I<lb/>
knew it had been sent, would try to trace it.<lb/>
Again, thanking you for the reprint</p>
<p>I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours sincerely</salute>

Postscript<lb/>
As I was about to seal my letter to you<lb/>
have just received in my mail a large copy<lb/>
of the picture "<unclear>Conquerors</unclear> of Yellow Fever,"(size 16<lb/>
by 18) from John Wyeth and Brother of Phila<lb/>
delphia, also included with it another copy of your<lb/>
article. Of course I will have the large size<lb/>
picture framed. It is not only a beautiful work<lb/>
of art, but also a permanent reminder to me<lb/>
of the great value to humanity, that the<lb/>
American Yellow Fever Commission proved<lb/>
the method of transmission of yellow fever.<lb/>
Yours sincerely<lb/>
John R. Taylor.<lb/>
