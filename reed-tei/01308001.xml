<salute>Dear Doctor Thayer:</salute>
</opener>
<p><hi>Re</hi> my physical condition. I am, I think, slowly acquiring some<lb/>
<del>physical</del> endurance, although not at the rate I had hoped. I attribute this<lb/>
mainly to the fact that the bladder trouble has been rather worse since<lb/>
my return; about the same over-frequency and with more pain at these inter-<lb/>
vals. Days before yesterday afternoon (Sun. Jan. 4th.) I began having<lb/>
considerable continuous pain<del>,</del> from this trouble, which lasted (roughly)<lb/>
two nights and a day. On the supposition that this pain might be caused<lb/>
by acidity, to which a similar trouble at the Hopkins was, I believe, at-<lb/>
tributed, I began taking a little sodium bicarb. after meals. This, as<lb/>
a substitute for a &ldquo;fizzy&rdquo; medicine (powder) given me after meals during<lb/>
the latter part of my stay at the Hopkins, after the continuous pain<lb/>
above mentioned. I have had no pain since early this morning and, although<lb/>
rather &ldquo;limp&rdquo; after a bad night feel able to go about a certain number<lb/>
of my &ldquo;lawful occasions.&rdquo; If, however, you think that the &ldquo;fizzy&rdquo; powder<lb/>
after meals would be better than the sodium bicarb., may I have the pre-<lb/>
scription? I am, of course, <del><unclear></unclear></del> taking the medicine Dr. Pierce gave me,<lb/>
at your instance: Rx, No. <unclear>124464</unclear>. It was extremely thoughtful to give me<lb/>
a bottle of the medicine itself, but <del><unclear>here again I</unclear></del> as I have no copy of the<lb/>
prescription, I am writing Dr. Pierce for it, as you said that you wished<lb/>
me to take the medicine for a month and I do not wish to get out of it.</p>
<p>I am extremely desireous not to have to stop work again and am<lb/>
taking all possible pains with myself, from this reason, as well as from<lb/>
my deep appreciation of all that you have done for me and my desire to co-<lb/>
operate in every way possible. It is by no means so easy, however, to re-<lb/>
adjust oneself to the anxieties and complications of the &ldquo;state of life&rdquo;<lb/>
to which I have returned, as it was to relax into the heavenly peace of<lb/>
the Hopkins, adjusted to my particular needs. For instance, I came back<lb/>
to find that Miss Brown has been having a series of &ldquo;heart attacks,&rdquo; <del>for</del><lb/>
during my absence, about which I am <hi>much</hi> concerned and about which I have<lb/>
not yet been able to get her to see a doctor. Also, I've had to get up<lb/>
data (<hi>re</hi> payments and non-payments) for a law suit for my cousin, who han-<lb/>
dles my small financial affairs, work up a little material for the book<lb/>
and reorganize our living arrangements--i. e. try getting meals at the caf&eacute;<lb/>
instead of in our apartment<unclear>:</unclear> We will get better dinners and with less<lb/>
trouble, but it will be more expensive. We will still get our own break-<lb/>
fasts and lunches. I am <del><unclear>still</unclear></del> keeping up the milk between meals and<lb/>
at about 8.30 at night.</p>
<p>I am finding it rather difficult to write, as two steam pipes<lb/>
have broken in the wall of &ldquo;my&rdquo; part of the apartment! The atmosphere is<lb/>
a bit &ldquo;steamy&rdquo; for concentrated narrative, and the constant telephone calls<lb/>
from the Resident Manager, who promises &ldquo;reinforcements&rdquo; (carpenter, plum-<lb/>
ber and electrician) while originally cheering are now merely tedious: the<lb/>
above mentioned trio being already a half day overdue! Well, its all in<lb/>
days work, and rather funny, even though uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Have not yet been to either Library, as I found some material I<lb/>
could work up here and, frankly, haven't felt up to working away from the<lb/>
apartment. I would have gone to-day, but for the bad weather and let the<lb/>
Manager and the broken pipes &ldquo;work out their own salvation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>salvation."</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book&rdquo; is already in the hands of the printers, Williams<lb/>
and Wilkins of Baltimore. However, as I wrote Dr. Rutledge, I was able<lb/>
to turn over to Dr. Frost nearly everything he wanted (prior to reading<lb/>
proof) on the day I left the Hopkins. The few things I am working up<lb/>
now can be handled in the galley proof.</p>
<p>With all manner of good wishes for yourself, Dr. and Mrs.<lb/>
Rutledge and &ldquo;Miss&rdquo; Rutledge, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly and gratefully yours,</salute>
