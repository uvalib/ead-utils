FROM GUST LAMBERT<lb/>
Hon. Donald H. McLean,<lb/>
House Office Building,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Congressman:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I volunteered for innoculation and had one of the Walter Reed (experimental)<lb/>
cases of yellow fever.</p>
<p>Furthermore I--a private in the Hospital Corps--was detailed for duty with<lb/>
Major Reed's Yellow Fever Commission, spent most of my time with Commission<lb/>
members and-hearing their comments-was thoroughly conversant with developments<lb/>
and conclusions.</p>
<p>On many occasions I heard Major Reed and Lieutenant Carroll discuss the lack of<lb/>
fatalities among experimental cases; debate as to whether it was attribuable<lb/>
to mild attacks, time saved in diagnosis, or extra-ordinary skill in treatment,<lb/>
and conclude that skill played the larger part.</p>
<p>They often expressed the fear-especially in the earlier stages of experiments-<lb/>
that a death would cut their work short by cutting off the supply of volunteers.</p>
<p>They referred in terms of the highest praise to Dr. Roger Post Ames and Gust E.<lb/>
Lambert.</p>
<p>From my personal experience as a patient I can cite examples of the skill and<lb/>
fidelity of both.</p>
<p>On one occasion I was in great distress. The Doctor who was in charge (during<lb/>
Dr. Ames own illness with yellow fever) looked at me and walked out without<lb/>
giving any instructions. The nurse on duty then awakened Lambert (who was on<lb/>
night duty and asleep during the day). Lambert examined and catheterized me<lb/>
which probably saved my life.</p>
<p>On another occasion a large abscess which-according to the official report of<lb/>
my case-was &ldquo;retarding recovery&rdquo;-was given no attention by the doctor above re-<lb/>
ferred to. Lambert reported the condition to Dr. Ames who was carried on his bed<lb/>
about a quarter mile to me where he lanced the abscess. (He, too, was suffering<lb/>
with yellow fever).</p>
<p>I consider it a very grave injustice that-during his lifetime-Dr. Ames received<lb/>
no recognition for having played one of the most important parts in ridding the<lb/>
world of yellow fever. I sincerely hope that belated recognition may be granted<lb/>
his widow and beg that you use your influence to secure enactment in the House<lb/>
of the legislation to that end which passed the Senate as Senate Bill Number 1850.</p>
<p>I most sincerely hope that the government may reward Gust E. Lambert for the risk<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03335002"/>
he ran in voluntarily nursing ALL the Walter Reed experimental cases of yellow<lb/>
fever, and for the skill, fidelity and sympathy he gave to his work. I hope this<lb/>
recognition may be given this broken, crippled man while he is alive to appre-<lb/>
ciate it. To this end I beg your sincere efforts to secure enactment of H. R.<lb/>
No. 4030.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
