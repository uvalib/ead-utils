<salute>Dear Doctor Rosenau:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter came Friday and the MS Saturday, with the notes<lb/>
interleaved in it. Thank you very much for your good opinion of it.<lb/>
I too think it convincing as far as I have gone.</p>
<p>About the Maya country: It might have been better to have given<lb/>
only the translations of such parts of their MSS as I used (all avail-<lb/>
able which bear on the subject, I think). The insertion of the origi-<lb/>
nal may have broken the thread of the narrative. On the other hand, I<lb/>
did not want Maya scholars--like Mr. Spinden--to say that I had mis-<lb/>
quoted, or mistranslated these records: especially as I had to take<lb/>
issue with old Bishop Carillo in a translation, the very text of <unclear>which</unclear><lb/>
was in question.</p>
<p>I did do a good deal of study on this matter: Beltran's and<lb/>
Padre Buenaventura's grammars and two or three imperfect dictionaries.<lb/>
I think I put all of six weeks--maybe eight--on the photostat of the<lb/>
Chumayel books and have quite a lot of it translated--after a fashion.<lb/>
There was nothing else to do. I doubt if further archaelogical re-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01215002"/>
-2-<lb/>
re-<lb/>
search in that country will give any data on this subject not already<lb/>
available. I would like, however, to have a full translation (or a<lb/>
photostat) of the Tizimen MS. That of Mani--in Brinton's opinion the<lb/>
most reliable of all--has disappeared.</p>
<p>Guiteras accepts my finding that there was no yellow fever in<lb/>
the tierra caliente or elsewhere in Mexico at the time of the Conquest,<lb/>
but is not equally convinced about its absence in Yucatan. In my judge-<lb/>
ment the argument is more convincing for the latter than for Mexico, be-<lb/>
cause (1) we have a better native history in Yucatan than we have for<lb/>
Mexico: (2) During the Conquest of Yucatan (from 1528 to 1541 inclusive)<lb/>
<hi>all</hi> of the action took place on the low-lands (there are no high lands)<lb/>
now infectable territory where Stegomyia abound; while most of the ac-<lb/>
tion of the Mexican Conquest (1519-21 only) was on the plateau and the<lb/>
absence of any note of yellow fever in either country means more for<lb/>
<del>its</del><add>the</add> absence <add>of the disease</add> from Yucatan than it does for Mexico (a) on account of the<lb/>
nature of the terrain and (b) the greater <hi>time</hi> spent there.</p>
<p>(3) There is a fairly complete sanitary history, direct or im-<lb/>
plied, of Yucatan for 107 years after its conquest, during which time<lb/>
it was quite thoroughly settled, and not thinly settled, by Spaniards<lb/>
with no evidence of yellow fever; and (4) an epidemic <add>of yellow Fever</add> in 1648 evidently<lb/>
among a people, Spaniards and Indians, virgin to this infection and<lb/>
clearly unknown to the former. This latter is the same evidence that<lb/>
Finlay relies on when he counts the epidemic of 1649 the first that<lb/>
ever visited Cuba.</p>
<p>I think the absence of yellow fever from Yucatan about the time<lb/>
of the Conquest--say from 85 years before to 107 after it--is as nigh<lb/>
proven as one can well prove a negative propostion.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f01215003"/>
<p>proposition.</p>
<p>-3-</p>
<p>I am going to write you a Memorandum about your suggestions<lb/>
<unclear>seriatum</unclear>--an<add>d</add> some of them are going to be quite long. You have made<lb/>
me think.</p>
<p>With very best remembrances to yourself and Mrs. Rosenau, in<lb/>
which Laura, who is writing this, joins,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
Enclosures.<lb/>
