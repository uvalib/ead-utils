<salute>My dear General Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your note of September 10th enclosing the card from<lb/>
Doctor Hench reached me a few minutes ago. I am delighted<lb/>
that he is well enough to go back home again. I doubt very<lb/>
much if he received my letter before leaving Colorado Springs<lb/>
but I am sure that it will be forwarded on to him immediately.<lb/>
I note that he may be here in Washington on September 20th but<lb/>
apparently his stay will be a very short one. I assume that he<lb/>
intends coming to New York the latter part of October and then,<lb/>
if he is well enough, coming on down to attend the annual meet-<lb/>
ing here in Washington. In view of the fact that there is nothing<lb/>
special to come up before the Walter Reed annual meeting except<lb/>
the possibility of continuing the extra amount granted to Mrs.<lb/>
Reed last year, <hi>I do not think that Dr. Hench should put himself<lb/>
to any trouble to come down unless he feels up to it physically.</hi></p>
<p>J. R. K-<lb/>
thinks so too</p>
<p>Kate and I are still hoping to get around to see you and<lb/>
Mrs. Kean in a few days. She has not been very well recently and<lb/>
is now going through a number of tests at Walter Reed including<lb/>
X-Ray surveys of her gastro-intestinal tract.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Faithfully yours,</salute>
<signed>J. F. Siler</signed>
If Mrs Reed should die in the next month we would have to decide whether<lb/>
we should give her allowance to Blossom, who I hear has made inquiries<lb/>
about it. I think that it would be well to decide this matter next month-<lb/>
If you decide not to come I hope you will give your proxy to Siler or me-<lb/>
Our wish and prayer for you is that you do not undertake anything new<lb/>
or that can be avoided-<lb/>
Affectionately<lb/>
J. R. Kean<lb/>

P. S. I have received thru Col. Siler's activ-<lb/>
ity ten copies very nicely gotten up of the<lb/>
addresses made on the Evening of May 12-<lb/>
1948 by Gen Bless, Dr. Soper and yourself-<lb/>
It seems that the State Dept has no more<lb/>
copies but the Public Health had secured<lb/>
400 and in some <unclear>way</unclear> Dr W. H. Wright-cha<lb/>
chairman of the Intersociety Committee got<lb/>
some of them and has sent me 10 at the<lb/>
request of Col. Siler- J. R. K<lb/>
Excuse my use of Silers letter- This does not<lb/>
need an answer-<lb/>
