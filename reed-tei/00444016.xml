<salute>My dear Mabel-</salute>

<p>I know you would be so glad to hear the<lb/>
good news that on receipt of Mr Dalzells dispatch to me<lb/>
I felt like sending you the contents of his message by<lb/>
wire rather than sending it by mail. I have no doubt<lb/>
my message was delivered to you yesterday- Mr. Dalzells'<lb/>
was simply in these words. &ldquo;The Lazear Carroll bill passed<lb/>
the House today&rdquo;,- I inferred from this that it was the<lb/>
bill giving you a pension which had passed the Senate<lb/>
weeks ago but the enclosed clipping from this mornings<lb/>

Pittsburgh Gazette shows that it was not and that the bill<lb/>
passed yesterday was an entirely new bill though differing<lb/>
from the forms only in the substitution of the word<lb/>
&ldquo;annuity&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;pension&rdquo;- I can readily conjecture<lb/>
why this change was made- The Pension Committee of<lb/>
The House had a rule that no application for an<lb/>
increase of pension would be entertained in any case where<lb/>
the pension had been granted by a special act of Congress<lb/>
That was exactly your case and the chairman of that<lb/>
Committee insisted on a strict adherence to the rule<lb/>
without exception- Mr Dalzell wrote me months ago that<lb/>

JESSE T. LAZEAR<lb/>
this rule was the great obstacle to overcome and I almost, for<lb/>
that reason, looked upon our efforts in your behalf as loves<lb/>
labor lost- Several days ago I wrote to D<hi rend ="superscript">r</hi> Mansfelde that<lb/>
I was apprehensive of failures merely because of the existence<lb/>
of this rule and I then suggested <add>to him</add> that my only hope was to<lb/>
change the name of the relief we asked for from the name<lb/>
of a pension to that of an annuity. Strange to say, this<lb/>
was the very course <unclear>presented</unclear> to get over the difficulty-<lb/>
How it happened I do not know but the coincidence<lb/>
was remarkable- It has the desired effect however and<lb/>
we ought to be satisfied. &ldquo;A rose will smell as sweet<lb/>
by any other name&rdquo;. All we wanted was the rose.</p>

<p>In addition to the telegram I sent to you I also sent one yesterday<lb/>
afternoon to D<hi rend ="superscript">r</hi> Mansfelde- His untiring zeal for you and Mrs Carroll<lb/>
in this matter has made me love the man- I have kept<lb/>
up a constant correspondence with him for many months<lb/>
in regard to yourself- He is coming to visit me next months<lb/>
in compliance with my urgent invitation- I desired in<lb/>
this way to express my gratitude for what he has done<lb/>
for you- I never knew an instance of disinterested kindness<lb/>
such as he has exhibited in the case of yourself and Mrs<lb/>
Carroll- To D<hi rend ="superscript">r</hi> Mansfelde and to my friends Hon John<lb/>
Dalzell and Senator Knox I feel <add>that</add> the most sucred and<lb/>
lasting obligation of gratitude are one both from you and me-<lb/>

This new bill introduced yesterday by Mr Dalzell will have to go to<lb/>
the Senate for concurrence by that body- But Senator Knox<lb/>
will put it through and perhaps that may be done in<lb/>
a day or two- And as the President personally recommended<lb/>
this legislative, he will really sign the bill.</p>
<p>I suppose your mother is with you- If so, please<lb/>
remember me to her and hug the dear children for me-</p>
