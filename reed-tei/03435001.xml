Hon. Harry H. Woodring,<lb/>
The Secretary Of War,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
<salute>Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Public - No. 858 - 70th. Congress - &ldquo;An act to recognize<lb/>
the high public service rendered by Major Walter Reed<lb/>
and those associated with him in the discovery of the<lb/>
cause and means of transmission of yellow fever&rdquo; - reads,<lb/>
in part, as follows:</p>
<p><unclear>&ldquo;</unclear> * * the Secretary of War be, and he is hereby, author-<lb/>
ized and directed to publish annually in the Army Register<lb/>
a roll of honor on which shall be carried the following<lb/>
names: Walter Reed * * James A. Andrus, (Corrected by<lb/>
H. R. 11899 - 71st. Congress, 2d. Session - to read John<lb/>
H. Andrus) * * and to define in appropriate language the<lb/>
part which each of these persons played in the experimen-<lb/>
tations * * <unclear>&rdquo;</unclear></p>
<p>The roll of honor, as published, ascribes motives of a<lb/>
number of volunteers while definition of the part I played<lb/>
is far from complete and does not even give credit for the<lb/>
&ldquo;character excellent&rdquo; on my discharge.</p>
<p>I respectfully request that definition of the part played<lb/>
by me be revised to incorporate the following facts:</p>
<p>John H. Andrus, private Hospital Corps, voluntarily nur-<lb/>
sed yellow fever patients during an epidemic at Guanajay<lb/>
Barracks in July-August, 1900. At the side of two men<lb/>
as they died, and nursing others critically ill, he<lb/>
feared the disease. Later, at Columbia Barracks, he<lb/>
was detailed for duty with Major Reed's Commission.<lb/>
Much of his work, breeding and caring for mosquitoes to<lb/>
be used in experiments, was in the small laboratory in<lb/>
which Major Reed and Lieutenant Carroll spent many hours<lb/>
in discussion and at their microscopes. He became so<lb/>
interested in the work of the Commission that, at a time<lb/>
when a volunteer had withdrawn and Major Reed had declar-<lb/>
ed his intention to order his own innoculation, Andrus<lb/>
volunteered for experiment and was infected with yellow<lb/>
fever by an injection of blood from an experimental case.<lb/>
He became ill Jan. 28, 1901, being twelfth in the series<lb/>
of cases at Camp Lazear. He left the Army Apr<unclear>.</unclear> 24,<lb/>
1902, with character excellent.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03435002"/>
<p>To substantiate the facts presented I offer the following:<lb/>
<list type="simple">
<item>&ldquo;Nursed yellow fever&rdquo; - See copy of letter from Act'g Asst.<lb/>
Surgeon J. F. Dunshie. Also 1st. endorsement on appli-<lb/>
cation for transfer for duty in China or Philippines.</item>
<item>&ldquo;Duty with Commission&rdquo; - Have no documentary evidence.<lb/>
Brigadier General A. E. Truby (retired) can verify.</item>
<item>&ldquo;Major Reed's intention to order his own innoculation&rdquo; -<lb/>
No documentary evidence. General Truby can probably<lb/>
confirm as, at the time, Lieutenant Carroll pleaded with<lb/>
the Major not to order his innoculation on the ground that<lb/>
his age and poor physical condition (The Major had but<lb/>
recently recovered from an illness) would make the Major's<lb/>
innoculation very hazardous. I have no doubt but that<lb/>
Lieutenant Carroll called upon General Truby (then a first<lb/>
lieutenant) for assistance in dissuading the Major.<lb/>
The Major and General Truby were <unclear>veryb</unclear> good friends.</item>
<item>&ldquo;Character excellent&rdquo; - See photostat of discharge certif-<lb/>
icate.</item>
</list></p>
<p>Please have all enclosures returned to me when they have<lb/>
served your purpose as I value them very highly.</p>

<salute>Respectfully,</salute>
<signed>John H. Andrus</signed>.
