<salute>My Dear Daughter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>(1) I am writing with my <hi>old</hi> stylet.<lb/>
<del><unclear>Dr G</unclear></del> I dropped from my pocket at <unclear>Dr. Grille</unclear><lb/>
front door - saturday night. His boy-adop-<lb/>
ted - Pete found it &amp; finding my card<lb/>
in the crack of the door - made the Sherlock-<lb/>
Holmes deduction that it was mine &amp; as<lb/>
Grubbs took the Manabi for Buenaventura &amp;<lb/>
Guayaquil - as the same time I shipped a-<lb/>
board this vessel - the <unclear>Ucayali</unclear> - &amp; as Pete<lb/>
came down with him - I have it.</p>
<p>2) We are entering the &ldquo;embosca&rdquo; of the<lb/>
Guayaquil River - i.e. the gulf into which<lb/>
the river widens out &amp;, it being 6.55, should<lb/>
raise Puna by 8.30 or 9 &amp; reach Guaya-<lb/>
quil<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00823002"/>
2<lb/>
Guayaquil by <del>11.30 or</del><add>12 or</add> 12.30. I presume<lb/>
we leave tomorrow morning- It may<lb/>
be go down the river tonight, &amp; cross the<lb/>
bar tomorrow morning- The bay is not<lb/>
attempted at night. From the mouth of<lb/>
the river to Payta is about 24 hours - i.e.<lb/>
I get there on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>- As I left Balt. the mor-<lb/>
ning of the 11 - or rather the train did - that<lb/>
will be <hi>22</hi> days en route &amp; hours! I<lb/>
came down in <del>14</del><add>15</add> days before- Well <hi>I</hi><lb/>
lost no time- Had been there on the <hi>26</hi>. if<lb/>
we had not stopped at Havana <unclear>-- i.e,</unclear> had <unclear>to-<lb/>
kena Pan. R. R. boat,</unclear> I do <hi>not</hi> regret stay<lb/>
ing over &amp; correcting Major <unclear>Bryam's</unclear> proof.<lb/>
Although I would not have done so of<lb/>
my own volition. I had not <add>fore</add> know how im-<lb/>
portant it was.</p>
<p>It has not been an agreeable trip - (a) my state<lb/>
room is far toward &amp; the pitch of the boat<lb/>
is<lb/>

is a nuisance. The vessel is crowded - &amp; as I trans-<lb/>
ferred to it on <hi>Saturday</hi> - she sailed Monday-<lb/>
naturally the early passengers had prefer-<lb/>
ence- Also I transferred in Panama &amp; the<lb/>
rooms were given out in Colon - hence I<lb/>
<del>got</del> &ldquo;picked a lemon&rdquo; as Henry would say. How-<lb/>
ever I have a room to myself. &amp; many have not.<lb/>
There are two French Aviators aboard for Lima<lb/>
to instruct the Peruvian Army - one at my<lb/>
table to whom I translate &amp; advise on the<lb/>
menu. A nice fellow, 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Lieut. Also a<lb/>
<hi>naturalist</hi> going to the high land in the<lb/>
Southern Equador - where it seems there is<lb/>
American Company &amp; gold mines. He is a <hi>very</hi><lb/>
interesting man: Knows <unclear>Bringham</unclear> of Yale, &amp;<lb/>
has worked in these countries for 22 years: The<lb/>
Chief <unclear>Engineer- <add>a</add>Greenock</unclear> man - was <unclear>Asst.</unclear><lb/>
Engineer on the Am. Dredge on the <hi>old</hi><lb/>

Panama Canal. Thinks he saved his life<lb/>
by winning $9,000 - at Rou-<lb/>
lette - at the<lb/>
Club Inter-<lb/>
national - in Panama; with which he left<lb/>
the Isthmus &amp; went to N.O,. He too is inter-<lb/>
esting- As is an American Engeer.- <del><hi>Mott</hi></del><lb/>
<hi>Mott</hi> - who worked in Mexico for 16 years &amp; then<lb/>
went to France (has Captain on his Card but enlisted<lb/>
as a private he says). He goes down to representing<lb/>
the Curtis people to see if he can establish Avi-<lb/>
ation on a Commercial basis - especially for<lb/>
the Post. Office. He has three planes with him. I<lb/>
tell him - that there is doubtless an opening in<lb/>
Peru but a <hi>much</hi> greater field in Colum-<lb/>
bia - <hi>9</hi> days on a <hi>weekly</hi> mail - from Bogota<lb/>
to Baranguilla - &amp; a good one in Equador-<lb/>
Columbia has an abundance of money-<hi>gold</hi> I<lb/>
am told - from the high price of Coffee &amp; hides &amp; - to some<lb/>
extent - Cattle. There are - so Gen. Harding says - about<lb/>
40.000<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00823005"/>
5<lb/>
40.000 cattle on the <unclear>zone pastures</unclear> - mainly from<lb/>
Columbia. I judge.</p>
<p>Did I tell you that Irazu had had <hi>many</hi><lb/>
irruptions of smoke &amp; cinders the last two<lb/>
years? The cattle pasturing there on have been<lb/>
removed because many died from eating<lb/>
the ash covered grass. My naturalist says that<lb/>
this mountain - <unclear>as does Tursaba</unclear> - gave out <hi>arsenic</hi><lb/>
in its fumes &amp; ash<del><unclear></unclear></del>, some 60 years ago! See what<lb/>
one learnes by talking.</p>
<p>There is a very - or rather quite - pretty girl aboard<lb/>
about 17 I judge &amp; chaperoned by her father - do<lb/>
you remember Eliza Espinoza's preference for a<lb/>
father in that role - &ldquo;one's mother knows so many<lb/>
thing, one should not do&rdquo; - &amp; three students - re-<lb/>
turning from the U.S., She is having the time<lb/>
of her life, I hope she gets off at Guayaquil lest<lb/>
it break up 3 promising romances, she is however<lb/>
prettier than anyone I ever saw in Guayaquil<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00823006"/>
so may be she is from Lima.</p>

<p>I am well but had to put on extra un-<lb/>
der clothes yesterday. I took them off this<lb/>
morning - because it sh'd be worn in Guaya-<lb/>
quil. &amp; I am purposing <del>with</del> going ashore-<lb/>
- as I have an Immune Certificate. Will put<lb/>
them on again tomorrow &amp; am glad of the<lb/>
chance as my <del>truck</del> trunk is <hi>too</hi> full-<lb/>
I told you so.</p>
<p>I get on very well with my spanish testa-<lb/>
ment, possibly pay more attention than<lb/>
if it were English.</p>
<p>I mail this in Guayaquill - so as to both<lb/>
save time &amp; avoid the Payta Postmistress<lb/>
Love to all of you- This is my <hi>5</hi><hi rend="superscript">th</hi> letter - one of<lb/>
them a <hi>note</hi> only. 2 from Havana: 2 from the Tivoli<lb/>
