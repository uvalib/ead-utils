<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Dr. Angell has carefully gone over your list<lb/>
of memorabilia, and we would like very much to have photographs<lb/>
or photostats of the following:</p>
<p>From the list which you suggested in your letter of February 23:</p>
<p>Items 2, 3, 4 and 5. You have sent us a photostat copy of the<lb/>
letter covered in item 5, but we would appreciate having another<lb/>
photostat of this letter, with the addition of the one dated<lb/>
January 1, 1901, with Reed's signature, please. The former<lb/>
photostat did not have Reed's signature. Also, we should like<lb/>
items 8, 9, 10, 13, 14 and 15 no</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>should have<lb/>
# 7 (cong medal)</p>
<p>In addition to the above, we should also like photostats<lb/>
and photographs of the following items shown on your general list of<lb/>
data in your possession:<lb/>
<list type="simple">
<item>10 - A photograph of this little smokestack might be interesting to<lb/>
reproduce with the building #1.</item>
<item>18 - Photostats of a few of the clippings from the scrap book -<lb/>
some which you think of great interest.</item>
<item>? -</item>
<item>21 - The paper cutter.</item>
<item>23 - Again, some of these photographs which you think would be inter-<lb/>
esting for our purpose.</item>
<item>Birthplace</item>
<item>25 - A photostat of this if you think it is not too technical for<lb/>
the program.</item>
<item><p>42 - In addition to some original letters of Gorgas and General<lb/>
Wood, we would like very much to have the letter of Sir William<lb/>
Osler, quoted by Col. J. R. Kean in his address as given in<lb/>
The Military Surgeon of March, 1928, p. 293, and which reads<lb/>
as follows: &ldquo;. . . of the altruistic instincts, veneration<lb/>
is not the most highly developed at the present day;<lb/>
but I hold strongly with the statement that it is<lb/>
the sign of a dry age when the great men of the<lb/>
past are held in light esteem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>dont have</p>
<p>We should also like to have photostats of one or two letters<lb/>
from Dr. Welch, particularly the one appraising Walter Reed's<lb/>
work. Some of <unclear>those</unclear> letters are reproduced in Dr. Kelly's<lb/>
book; others in General Truby's volume, but I regret to say<lb/>
they are not always reproduced correctly. Particularly, in<lb/>
the letter from Walter Reed to Mrs. Reed, of which you kindly<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04212016"/>
-2-<lb/>
12 March 1948<lb/>
sent a photostat (Dec. 31, 1900) we noticed inaccuracies in both<lb/>
Dr. Kelly's book and General Truby's &ldquo;Memoir of Walter Reed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should also like items</p></item>
<item>45, 48 (one or two of each - critical and complimentary;) 49 -one<lb/>
or two letters from General Kean which you think most import-<lb/>
ant in their relationship; 57 and 62, all of these from your<lb/>
typed list.</item>
</list></p>
<p>We hesitate to ask you aseemble this long list of material<lb/>
for us (if, indeed, you will be good enough to do it for us), but we<lb/>
do wish to assume the expense for all photostats and photographs.<lb/>
You know, of course, that we are planning only a 16 page program,<lb/>
and that we shall use about three or four pages for the Order of Exer-<lb/>
cises and Hall of Fame data, which would leave us only 12 or 13 pages<lb/>
for material relating to Reed. With this in mind, and the fact that<lb/>
our fund does not permit of very large expenditures for photographic<lb/>
material, we must rely entirely upon your judgment in dealing with<lb/>
the items indicated by us.</p>
<p>We had a gracious letter from General Reed authorizing the<lb/>
use of any material, from any source, for the program.</p>
<p>You may also be interested to know that Wyeth, Inc. are making<lb/>
new plates, suitable for our program, and we expect proof at any<lb/>
moment. Again, I wish to express our deep appreciation for your<lb/>
suggestions regarding the use of the painting, as well as for all<lb/>
of your other suggestions of letters, photographs, etc., etc.</p>
