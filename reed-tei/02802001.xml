ISTHMIAN CANAL COMMISSION<lb/>
OFFICE OF CHIEF SANITARY OFFICER<lb/>
ANCON, CANAL ZONE.<lb/>
<date value="1905-04-01">April 1, 1905.</date>
</dateline>
Hon. W. H. Taft,<lb/>
Secretary of War, Washington, D.C.<lb/>
(Through the Governor of the Canal Zone)<lb/>
<salute>Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>In your letter of March 17th to the President in regard to<lb/>
a report made by Dr. C.L. Reed you used the following language:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reply of the Commission seems to show that a<lb/>
large part of the plans and the action of the Commission,<lb/>
which Dr. Reed criticises, was fully concurred in and<lb/>
agreed to by Colonel Gorgas and the other medical officers<lb/>
in the employ of the Commission. It is, doubtless, true<lb/>
that Colonel Gorgas and his staff believed that it would<lb/>
be wiser to give them an entirely free hand in the<lb/>
matter of ordering construction, supplies and the employ-<lb/>
ment of subordinates. It is quite probable that had<lb/>
the approval of the Commission in the matter of ordering<lb/>
construction and supplies been dispensed with, there would<lb/>
have been fewer delays and less complaint on this<lb/>
account, but in the expenditure of such large sums as were<lb/>
necessary for the organization of the sanitary system,<lb/>
the construction of plants and the purchase of supplies,<lb/>
it may well be doubted whether the Commission would<lb/>
have been discharging its duty in withholding supervisory<lb/>
control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Either from Dr. Reed's report or other sources of<lb/>
information you are evidently under the impression that I,<lb/>
as head of the Sanitary Department, wished to make expenditure<lb/>
without the approval of the Commission. In other words, that<lb/>
I proposed such a plan as this:</p>
<p>That the Commission, for the year 1904, should place<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02802002"/>
2:-<lb/>
at my disposal $1,000,000, and that I should spend this as I<lb/>
thought best for the benefit of the Sanitary Department.</p>
<p>Nothing that I have ever said or written can fairly<lb/>
be construed into any such proposition. My experience as a<lb/>
government official for the last twenty-five years has taught<lb/>
me that any such proposition as this would be entirely illegal;<lb/>
and if it were legal, I would not wish to have any such un-<lb/>
necessary responsibility. What I have always proposed, and still<lb/>
urge, is some such scheme as this:</p>
<p>That I make a yearly, quarterly, or monthly estimate<lb/>
to the Commission, as they think best, and the estimate would<lb/>
be in the usual form such as this:</p>
<p>For the Year 1904.</p>
<p>Salary of Superintendent of Ancon Hospital $6,000<lb/>
Two physicians, each 2,400<lb/>
Medicines and medical supplies for 500 patients 10,000<lb/>
Subsistence for 500 patients 75,000<lb/>
Miscellaneous expenditures for maintenance of<lb/>
hospital and care of patients not otherwise<lb/>
mentioned 500<lb/>
etc,etc.</p>
<p>This estimate would be submitted to the Commission<lb/>
and their action upon it would be law, which would limit me<lb/>
in expenditure to the sums mentioned in the estimate. I would<lb/>
wish to have the Disbursing Officer assigned to the Sanitary<lb/>
Department, or some one designated as Disbursing Officer for the<lb/>
Sanitary Department. The sum approved by the Commission<lb/>
would then be placed to his credit, and he could make disburse-<lb/>
ments subject to law as any other disbursing officer does. I<lb/>
would like also to have an officer especially assigned to the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02802003"/>
3:-<lb/>
Sanitary Department who would perform the functions for the<lb/>
Sanitary Department that the Chief of Material &amp; Supplies at the<lb/>
present time does for the Canal at large; but in a small<lb/>
department, such as the Sanitary Department, the functions of<lb/>
both of these offices might very well be combined in one and<lb/>
the same man do both the disbursing and the purchasing. I<lb/>
would also wish to have a competent constructor assigned to<lb/>
the Sanitary Department to look after the construction and<lb/>
repairs.</p>
<p>And for these reasons:---I think I can make myself<lb/>
clearer by taking an instance. Take the screening of the fever<lb/>
wards at our main hospital, Ancon. This matter was estimated<lb/>
for in July; the Commission in August acted upon the estimate,<lb/>
modified it and authorized such screening as they thought<lb/>


advisable. Since that time the matter has entirely passed out<lb/>
of my hands and the wards are still unscreened. I brought the<lb/>
matter to the Governor's attention quite a number of times<lb/>
and the Governor has each time written to the Washington authori-<lb/>
ties on the subject. I mention this subject of screens as it<lb/>
is probably one of the most important sanitary measures that<lb/>
could come up, and one in which I have used every possible<lb/>
endeavor to expedite matters.</p>
<p>Under the Proposed organization the routine would<lb/>
have been as follows:</p>
<p>The estimate would have gone to the Commission, as<lb/>
it did in July; they would have acted upon it, as they did<lb/>
in August. As soon as it had been acted upon I would have<lb/>
directed my disbursing officer to purchase the necessary<lb/>
material and the constructing officer to do the constructing.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02802004"/>
4:-<lb/>
If the material was to have been gotten from the United States,<lb/>
which it probably would have been, it would not have taken<lb/>
more than six weeks, and all the screening, authorized by<lb/>
the Commission, should have been put up in another six weeks.<lb/>
In other words this most important piece of sanitation, under<lb/>
my organization, I think, should have been finished within<lb/>
three months. Under the present organization, eight months<lb/>
after it was asked for, it has not even been commenced, nor<lb/>
can I even guess at what time it will be commenced. As Sanitary<lb/>
Officer of the city of Havanna for nearly four years I had<lb/>
this organization and accomplished matters just as I describe.<lb/>
When anything was authorized by the proper authorities I could<lb/>
very rapidly bring it about.</p>
<p>Another important point in the efficiency of the<lb/>
Department is that it should be attached and dependent upon<lb/>
none of the other sub-divisions on the Isthmus, but its Chief<lb/>
should report directly to the supreme authority. It is one<lb/>
of the most important departments under the control of the<lb/>
Commission, both in the vital importance of the work it has<lb/>
to do and in the number of its employees.</p>
<p>The functions and duties of the Department are<lb/>
much varied, coming more generally and intimately in contact<lb/>
with the engineers than with any others. It is also the<lb/>
health authorities, representing the Republic of Panama in Colon<lb/>
and the city of Panama.</p>
<p>The reasons that make it desirable for the<lb/>
Governor, Chief Engineer, Chief of Material and Supplies,<lb/>
Paymaster, etc. to report directly to the Commission or to the<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02802005"/>
5:-<lb/>
supreme authority could apply as well to the Sanitary Department<lb/>
and with even more potency.</p>

Chief Sanitary Officer</signed>.
