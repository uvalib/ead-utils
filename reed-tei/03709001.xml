FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
<dateline>

</dateline>
4718 Woodlawn Ave<lb/>
Chicago<lb/>
General A E Truby<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir</salute>
</opener>
<p>It was not Dr Amador or any of the<lb/>
other Doctors it was Dr Pinto who had<lb/>
charge of the Hosp- while Dr Ames was sick<lb/>
Senator <unclear>Morris</unclear> introduced a Bill for<lb/>
the benefit of Dr Pinto, he wanted his<lb/>
heroism when he risked his life caring &ldquo;or<lb/>
treating&rdquo; yellow fever for the board recognized<lb/>
<hi>The man who stayed with Dr <unclear>Lezear</unclear><lb/>
was Schwieger,</hi> he had yellow fever at<lb/>
<unclear>guanajay</unclear> so he was immune <hi>schwieger<lb/>
also worked on the <unclear>May Carthwright</unclear></hi> case<lb/>
he was sent to cienfuegos <unclear>later an</unclear><lb/>
he has often mentioned that he served<lb/>
under your command at that place<lb/>
Schwieger think that because he helped<lb/>
take care of Dr <unclear>Lazear</unclear> who was a member<lb/>
of the Board he is entitled to recognition<lb/>
although he was an immune himself<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03709002"/>
I haven't seen the congressional<lb/>
record this year so I don't know if<lb/>
Mrs Ames have a bill in or not<lb/>
but if she has, I hope to heaven<lb/>
Dr Ames's work will be recognized<lb/>
When Maj Stark released Dr Ames as<lb/>
cured up at the Hosp Dr Ames came<lb/>
down to see us at once, he did not<lb/>
take a single day off to recuperate<lb/>
I think Maj. Reed had told him that<lb/>
things hasn't gone so good while he was<lb/>
absent as when he were <unclear>there,</unclear> every-<lb/>
one <unclear>els</unclear> took a vacation except Dr Ames<lb/>
Dr Pinto was releaved and Dr Ames<lb/>
took charge as before. The General mention<lb/>
that the War Dept. is opposed to the recognition<lb/>
of any one except of those who were inocculated<lb/>
at Camp <unclear>Lezear</unclear>, four men, Dr Cook, England,<lb/>
Hildebrand and Weatherwalk were not inocculated<lb/>
they only slept in dirty clothing building but<lb/>
they were paid at the time and later honored<lb/>
<hi>If</hi> yellow fever had been contagious<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03709003"/>
I would have been more exposed to<lb/>
the disease than the four combined.<lb/>
Also that if Mrs Ames succeeds there might<lb/>
be a chance for others like me, there can't<lb/>
be any <unclear>one els</unclear> but me except of<lb/>
course Mrs Gillen and <unclear>Lathic</unclear> and they<lb/>
were <unclear>immunes</unclear>, I don't know if I am<lb/>
right or not but I <hi>claim Andrus as<lb/>
my patient also</hi> I knew what to do<lb/>
in an emergency and they didn't<lb/>
I have affidavits from every one of the<lb/>
boys that I have been able to contact<lb/>
except <hi>Moran he think Mrs Gillen took<lb/>
care of him if Gillen had taken care<lb/>
of him he should mention <unclear>Lathic</unclear> also<lb/>
because they worked together on Andrus</hi>,<lb/>
but <hi>he is mistaken in that</hi> just as<lb/>
he is mistaken in the statement<lb/>
that he was offered $500.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> for taking<lb/>
part in the experiment Dr Ames<lb/>
would not have lied to him, I<lb/>
heard Moran was bragging that he was<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f03709004"/>
AC<lb/>
<unclear>In to L</unclear><lb/>
the only one who served the board<lb/>
for nothing I don't blame him<lb/>
for not taking $200.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> if he had<lb/>
been offered $500.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> but he wasn't<lb/>
I only wish the War Dept would<lb/>
order those who claims to have <unclear>nured</unclear><lb/>
the experimental cases to go to Washington<lb/>
&ldquo;at their own expense&rdquo; and lay their<lb/>
cards on the table. On May 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> when<lb/>
I appered before the Military affairs <unclear>Com</unclear>-<lb/>
I told the <unclear>Com</unclear>. that I was not asking<lb/>
for any compensation all I asked for<lb/>
was to be recognized as the nurse for<lb/>
the yellow fever Commission I was<lb/>
the only one serving the board with-<lb/>
out the inducement of extra pay<lb/>
Dear General I hope you will not think<lb/>
me preposterous if I say that the boards<lb/>
success in some mesure depended on<lb/>
Dr. Ames and in a small part to his man<lb/>
<unclear>friday</unclear></p>
