No. 17 --<lb/>
Daughter's letter<lb/>
of yesterday should have been numbered<lb/>
<hi>16</hi>.<lb/>
<salute>My own pre<del>s</del>cious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wrote<lb/>

to little daughter, on yesterday,<lb/>
her birth-day. I thought of you<lb/>
both a great deal &amp; wonder-<lb/>
ed how you were spending<lb/>
the day. I hope very pleas-<lb/>
antly. Your darling letter of<lb/>
July 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> arrived on the 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, but<lb/>
I am expecting several with<lb/>
tomorrow's (Saturday's) mail-<lb/>
under our new mail sched-<lb/>
ule, the interruption to the<lb/>
arrival &amp; departure of our<lb/>
letters is very annoying.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02056002"/>
You observe, dear Miss Wind-<lb/>
-beaten Farmer-lady, that I am<lb/>
not writing at 5.30 a.m. but<lb/>
at 2.30 o'clock P.M. That very<lb/>
early rising did pretty well<lb/>
for a week or so, and then<lb/>
it slowly, or rather, promptly<lb/>
petered out! I found that<lb/>
it didn't seem to enable me<lb/>
to accomplish any more than<lb/>
by the old system of getting up<lb/>
at about 7 or a quarter to 7.<lb/>
Now, I retire about 9.30 P.M.<lb/>
and sleep till a quarter to 7<lb/>
a.m. - Wander to the bath-<lb/>
room in my pajamas &amp; take<lb/>
a fascinating shower-bath-<lb/>
breakfast at 7.30 and get<lb/>
to the laboratory, distant<lb/>
about 75 yards, say at<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02056003"/>
8.15 to 8.30 a.m., where <add>I</add><del>we</del><lb/>
stay till 11.30 &amp; then come<lb/>
home to rest for lunch-<lb/>
Have I ever described my<lb/>
quarters to you? I really can't<lb/>
remember that I have done so.<lb/>
I have two rooms, each 10 x 15-<lb/>
a partition running from floor<lb/>
to about 7 1/2 ft. so as to leave<lb/>
good circulation of air over the<lb/>
partition, should the door between<lb/>
the rooms be shut,(which it never<lb/>
is). My front room looks north<lb/>
to the sea &amp; has a large door<lb/>
reaching from floor to ceiling, &amp;<lb/>
on either side of this <del>two</del> <add>a</add> good-<lb/>
sized window with glass sash<lb/>
&amp; a heavy outside wooden<lb/>
shutters- The rear room has<lb/>
the same high door &amp; two openings<lb/>
(windows) but no sash-only<lb/>
heavy shutters close these-<lb/>
In my front room, I have a<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02056004"/>
long wooden table stretching nearly<lb/>
across the room, which answers<lb/>
for my writing desk &amp; for official<lb/>
papers- Here, also, sits my lamp,<lb/>
on the other side is a long shelf<lb/>
on which I put my books-<lb/>
In the back, I have a good hosp-<lb/>
ital bed with mosquito-bar<lb/>
&amp; a small wooden table for<lb/>
a wash-stand- good shelves<lb/>
for my underwear &amp; a place<lb/>
for my clothes to hang. A small<lb/>
shelf in one corner holds my<lb/>
shaving outfit and completes<lb/>
the furniture, barring a couple<lb/>
of comfortable folding chairs.<lb/>
You thus see, lovie, dear, that<lb/>
I am living quite like a<lb/>
bachelor &amp; that, as my wants<lb/>
are few, I cannot complain<lb/>
of a lack of necessary Comforts.<lb/>
In your last, you spoke of<lb/>
its being so very hot and<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02056005"/>
said that your thermometer<lb/>
in your bed-room registered<lb/>
84&deg;- Well, I don't call to-day<lb/>
particularly warm here,<lb/>
but the thermometer as I<lb/>
write points to 83&deg;! Of course,<lb/>
it can't be called a <hi>cold</hi><lb/>
day- There is a good breeze<lb/>
blowing and this serves, I<lb/>
suppose, to make us feel <add>more</add> com-<lb/>
fortable than we otherwise<lb/>
would expect. I don't think<lb/>
that your month's expenses<lb/>
were very high- I had ex-<lb/>
pected that it would cost<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>100.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> to <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>115.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> per month- Of course,<lb/>
Woodward &amp; Lothnop's bill should<lb/>
be charged largely to my ac-<lb/>
count- If you and dear little<lb/>
piano-player are getting some-<lb/>
thing good to eat, I shall be<lb/>
quite satisfied with your list<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02056006"/>
of expenses- Am so sorry for<lb/>
my darling wifie's sake, that<lb/>
no rain had fallen &amp; that your<lb/>
garden was looking so badly.<lb/>
Perhaps, by this writing, the<lb/>
rains have come and things<lb/>
begin to promise better.<lb/>
I still think that you will have<lb/>
a pretty fair garden.<lb/>
Does the clover still blossom<lb/>
as much as ever? or has<lb/>
the Kentucy Blue begun to<lb/>
wrestle with it? How did<lb/>
the little maples &amp; the ever-<lb/>
greens stand the drouth?<lb/>
Here, sweetheart, I am getting<lb/>
sleepy and must take my after-<lb/>
noon's nap- will add a<lb/>
postscript in the morning<lb/>
before the Postman comes.<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02056007"/>
Saturday morning - 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Here I am<lb/>
trying to get my letter ready<lb/>
for the postman and have only<lb/>
a few minutes- How beau-<lb/>
tifully I slept last night,<lb/>
lovie, dear! Drs Carroll, La-<lb/>
zaer &amp; I went in on the<lb/>
7 P.M train to Havana, in<lb/>
order to pay our respects<lb/>
to Gen. Wood and came out on<lb/>
the 9 P.M, getting home in time<lb/>
for any &ldquo;early to bed&rdquo;- Isn't<lb/>
it sad about Mrs. Wood's<lb/>
younger sister being shut<lb/>
up in Pekin and probably<lb/>
massacred by the Chinese<lb/>
Mob? I asked Gen. Wood<lb/>
whether he had any later <add>&amp; more hopeful</add><lb/>
news, but he said no; that<lb/>
all the despatches pointed<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02056008"/>
to the death of the foreign<lb/>
colony- Of course, before<lb/>
this reaches you, we may hear<lb/>
some thing more definite-<lb/>
I sincerely hope that affairs<lb/>
may not be so bad in China<lb/>
as reported - The 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Inf,<lb/>
leave here on Monday - The<lb/>
regiment is under orders<lb/>
for China- Uncle Samuel<lb/>
seems to have his hands<lb/>
full these later days! We<lb/>
had a glorious shower, last<lb/>
afternoon, followed by a very<lb/>
cool evening- This morning<lb/>
it is delightful - and I am<lb/>
as hungry as a bear! If I<lb/>
could<del>nt</del> only have one of my<lb/>
sweet Farmer-lady's <hi>Keewaydin</hi><lb/>
breakfasts! Love to Helen &amp; Aunt<lb/>
Jane, if they are with you- Love<lb/>
and kisses for my own precious<lb/>
baby girls-</p>
