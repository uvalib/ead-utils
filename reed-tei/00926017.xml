<salute>My dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just received your letter of<lb/>
January 19, in which you ask about the money which you have<lb/>
deposited in the Banco Mercantil Americano. I have kept this<lb/>
matter in mind and have conferred with the new manager of the<lb/>
bank a Mr. Oermacen (I think that is the way it is spelled)<lb/>
and it was his judgement that it would probably be better to<lb/>
wait a while. There is still some probability that the Gov-<lb/>
erment may get a loan from the U.S. and in that case there<lb/>
certainly will be a rise in the value of the Peruvian currency.<lb/>
I am in pretty constant touch with the exchange on account of<lb/>
having my campaign funds in dollars with the Equitable Trust<lb/>
Company of New York. There has been a slight improvement lately<lb/>
but not enough to let you come out even on what you deposited<lb/>
comparing its value in dollars now and then, even including the<lb/>
interest. The last quotation was 3.57 but it has been up to<lb/>
3.65, and I rather think that it will go up above that figure<lb/>
again. You can not convert and come out even unless you get<lb/>
at least 3.70. Converting at 3.70 you would have $5.00 more<lb/>
than if you had taken it in U.S.C., when you left last year.</p>
<p>I judge that you have probably received several letters<lb/>
from me since you wrote this one of the 19th ultmo. I wrote<lb/>
you quite at length in one of them. In so far as the epidemic<lb/>
is concerned I think it is gone for good, but I am beginning<lb/>
my explorations now, with the idea of catching any new focus<lb/>
and knowing just what the conditions are beforehand. So far<lb/>
Dr. Caballero has reported nothing from the south and the men<lb/>
on the job in the north have seen nothing of a suspicious<lb/>
nature in the old territory.</p>
<p>Personally I should be very glad to see either you<lb/>
or Dr. White and it would be a great relief of responsibility<lb/>
to have you here to help me pass judgement and pronounce the<lb/>
last rites over the defunct Yellow Jack on this coast, but I,<lb/>
in looking at it from the economical standpoint, can not see<lb/>
that it is an absolutely necessary expenditure.</p>
<p>As things are now I am pretty much confined to my<lb/>
Lima Office, and will not be able to leave for the north until<lb/>
Caballero gets back to take temporary charge here during my<lb/>
absence. We have developed a rather big and probably a bit com-<lb/>
plicated organization, but it works and seems to be getting<lb/>
results. We have quite a system of complete daily weekly and<lb/>
monthly reports, complete records of house visits, percentage of<lb/>
breeding etc, and in this way I always know what is going on<lb/>
in the different sectors. I have been with the men in the field<lb/>
sufficiently to be able to judge from the reports what the work<lb/>
is. In this way we compile the records for the final report and<lb/>
can check on the work at the same time. I inclose copy of the<lb/>
preliminary report which I sent Dr. Rose, which is only a brief<lb/>
statement for their immediate use.</p>
