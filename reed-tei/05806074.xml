<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you for your letter of the sixth and for the nice<lb/>
things you say about my literary efforts. Any illusions<lb/>
I may have had on this score have been shattered by the<lb/>
promptness with which publishers bounce my brain child back<lb/>
at me.</p>
<p>In your letter you say, &ldquo;..if you would care to send me a<lb/>
carbon copy of the second version I should be glad to go<lb/>
over it page by page and send you such comments as I have&rdquo;.<lb/>
This is extremely kind of you and I appreciate it.</p>
<p>A copy of the last <xref id="f05806075">draft</xref> is enclosed. While the story<lb/>
is essentially the same as the one you have, this draft<lb/>
incorporates suggestions by Generals Kean and Truby and is,<lb/>
I think, very much better for their help.</p>
<p>My story was written, originally, as a chapter of &ldquo;Big Mo-<lb/>
ments In A Little Life&rdquo; - a one-volume (typewritten) account<lb/>
of events memorable to the writer - for the probable amuse-<lb/>
ment of my grandsons in years to come.</p>
<p>After General Truby sent his manuscript to me I got even by<lb/>
sending mine to him. His comments were gratifyingly<lb/>
laudatory and he strongly urged that I offer it for publi-<lb/>
cation.</p>
<p>I rewrote it with that in mind and am accumulating a nice<lb/>
little collection of rejection slips with an occasional<lb/>
<add>(publisher)</add> letter just warm enough to keep the last glimmer of hope<lb/>
from dying.</p>
<p>Yes - now that I have set out to find a publication to use<lb/>
my story - I'm anxious to succeed. And I would like to<lb/>
have it published while I am still alive and able to face<lb/>
any criticism that might develop. As I will be bedfast<lb/>
ten years the first of March, it will have to be published<lb/>
soon if I am to see any back-fire.</p>
<p>Your offer to go over it page by page gives me new hope.</p>
<p>I suppose you saw General Kean when you were in Washington.<lb/>
If you have never been in the military service you do not<lb/>
realize what a distant planet a major is to a private.<lb/>
That is how I knoe <hi>of</hi> General Kean when we were both in Cuba.<lb/>
He has been extraordinarily kind to me and I would give a<lb/>
great deal to meet him.</p>
<p>With many thanks for your kindness and with every good wish,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>J H Andrus</signed>
