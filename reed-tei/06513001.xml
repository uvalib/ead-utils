Colonel J. R. Kean, <unclear>i</unclear> L. Y. A.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Colonel Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been much interested in<lb/>
the report of the dedication of the<lb/>
Walter Reed shrine at <unclear>Bedroi</unclear>, and I<lb/>
notice that you took part in the cere-<lb/>
monies. I recall also that you took part<lb/>
in the Reed Memorial meeting of the<lb/>
Medical Society of the District of Columbia<lb/>
in December 1902, and as Editor of the<lb/>
Washington Medical Annals, I published<lb/>
an account of the meeting in January 1903</p>
<p>Knowing how interested you are<lb/>
in whatever pertains to the life and his-<lb/>
tory of Dr. Walter Reed, I want to say<lb/>
that I believe - I am correct in the statement<lb/>
that I saw him the last time he was at<lb/>
the Medical Museum, where both he and I<lb/>
were on duty. Dr. Borden had seen him<lb/>
professionally on the 14th, of November (1902)<lb/>
and made a diagnosis of appendicitis, but<lb/>
the next, day Reed was better &amp; less <unclear>pain</unclear>,<lb/>
less tenderness, less tension, temperature<lb/>
98.6, pulse 60, and Borden believed the<lb/>
attack was about over.</p>
<p>Reed came to the museum, and late<lb/>
in the afternoon he and I took a walk<lb/>
<unclear>thru</unclear> the Museum Hall, talking of con-<lb/>
ditions there and <unclear>[?]</unclear> changes like<lb/>
<unclear>I made</unclear>; <add>and he <unclear>spoke</unclear> of his illness,</add><lb/>
the next day, was Sunday, and he<lb/>
was not so well. I believe that the<lb/>
Saturday, the 15th was his last day at the<lb/>
Museum, and his talk with me, prob-<lb/>
ably his last, or nearly his last<lb/>
work there. The operation &amp; appendectomy,<lb/>
was on Monday the 17th, and he died on<lb/>
the 23d.</p>
<p>It is a great pleasure to me to be able<lb/>
to say that my relation with Dr. Reed were<lb/>
always pleasant in the nearly ten<lb/>
years of our association at the Museum.</p>

<salute>Yours truly</salute>
