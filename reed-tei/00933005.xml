<salute>Dear Scannell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was glad to get your letter and charts showing your work at<lb/>
Chiapas.</p>
<p>Right was the plan to take Tapachula--a key-point--and free it<lb/>
from Stegomyia whether it was infected or not. That is the method of<lb/>
handling a regional focus.</p>
<p>I am somewhat surprised at your deep well breeding and yet I<lb/>
need not have been, as King, of San Juan, P. R., found them breeding in<lb/>
cisterns to which they had no access save by a 16 ft. rain spout and<lb/>
I, myself, saw them breeding in a well with a plank top in a cellar<lb/>
in Bahia, Brazil.</p>
<p>I would like to know, however, three things:</p>
<p>First of all, how did you you know they were breeding in your<lb/>
wells? Did you draw larvae out, or judge by mosquitoes coming out<lb/>
of them? In the latter case, of course, they may have been just<lb/>
sheltering in them.</p>
<p>2/ What was the width of your wells and--more of less--the<lb/>
temperature of the water?</p>
<p>3. How can you tell whether your fish in the wells are alive or<lb/>
not?</p>
<p>One thing you can depend on in the small and moderate sized towns:<lb/>
They will free themselves from yellow fever by failure of the human<lb/>
host if they have a reasonable chance to do so: If the large towns<lb/>
and other key-points are controlled--unless there is susceptible im-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00933006"/>
im-<lb/>
/2<lb/>
migration your problem is solved.</p>
<p>Do you know how White found your address? He was at my house<lb/>
the day after Xmas and we had just received a Xmas card from yourself<lb/>
and Mrs. Scannell and the post mark gave me your address. That is<lb/>
one advantage of Xmas cards I have not seen exploited! By the way,<lb/>
Laura, who is typing this, would like to have Mrs. Scannell's pres-<lb/>
ent address as she has finally succeeded in getting a volume of her<lb/>
poems for &ldquo;the Scannells,&rdquo; including &ldquo;Sonny.&rdquo; Her delay in so doing<lb/>
was owing to the fact of the first edition being exhausted very<lb/>
quickly and there being a long delay, owing to strikes etc. before<lb/>
the appearance of the second. I consider it a good book.</p>
<p>With very best remembrances from us both, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely your friend,</salute>
</closer>
