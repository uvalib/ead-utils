<salute>dear Mr. Fisher:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am sending you a lot of MSS in re Impounded Waters. I doubt<lb/>
if you will thank me for them in addition to the special letters I<lb/>
have written on the same subject. Still, the more general informa-<lb/>
tion you have on the subject the better you can envisage any spe-<lb/>
cial problem and--if you have not completed your Report to Dr. Ran-<lb/>
kin--that too will be better and redound both to yourself and to<lb/>
the Service. I rather hope for yourself, however, that it is off<lb/>
your hands.</p>
<p>I will ask you to return these papers to me when you have read<lb/>
them as I may want them when I get to Chatanooga. I have offered to<lb/>
go there three days before the meeting so that if Dr. Welsh wants a<lb/>
consultation on the Alabama Regulations I would be available. I am<lb/>
rather hoping that my letter of October 3rd. to Hazlehurst will ren-<lb/>
der a personal meeting unnecessary, as all travelling and hotel ex-<lb/>
penses now are borne by myself and while I am willing to spend some<lb/>
of my money--as I have spent much of my life--in helping <add>the</add> control of<lb/>
malaria, I do not wish to do so unnecessarily.</p>
<p>I wish much you could have gone to Marion before the rains and<lb/>
judged of the ponds prior to the washing out of the creeks. I am in -<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01003005"/>
in-<lb/>
2.<lb/>
clined to think that the larvae you found in the pond itself were wash-<lb/>
ed in. I don't think their being small--provided you made the exami-<lb/>
nation soon after a rain--would be any criterion of their origen one<lb/>
way or the other. I don't know that small larvae drown more easily<lb/>
than large ones. They usually come down stream clinging to leaves: bits<lb/>
of floatage etc.</p>
<p>At Blewetts Falls we dipped a bight at the mouth of the stream one<lb/>
afternoon. It was negative, while the stream itself was breeding in<lb/>
eddies and side pools. There came a rain that night and many larvae--<lb/>
all sizes--were taken in the bight next morning and in the bucket in<lb/>
which we carried them--we were developing larvae then on a large scale<lb/>
and used buckets, not bottles emptying in the water from our dippers--<lb/>
we found babies, showing that we had poured in some eggs, which quite<lb/>
certainly washed down stream.</p>
<p>I hope that you examined the South side of the Catawba Pond, in<lb/>
which few streams flow, as here the element of washing down would have<lb/>
been to a great extent eliminated. The reason I don't think the Pond<lb/>
has been breeding mosquitoes--except those washed in from streams--is<lb/>
because the August examination of 1921--careful and painstaking--was<lb/>
negative, and to me unexpectedly negative.</p>
<p>If the temperature around Marion was like that at Winnsboro when<lb/>
I was there, production of Anopheles after October 9th. would have been<lb/>
of little sanitary importance, as it was too cold while I was there for<lb/>
the developement of the plasmodia in the mosquito, which requires, as<lb/>
you know, a somewhat higher temperature than the mosquito itself does.</p>
<p>At Badin there has always been breeding in the Pond and in not a<lb/>
few places. In one place--just in front of Mr. Elliott's--is the only<lb/>
place in which I ever saw breeding--possibly made, certainly increased<lb/>
by clearing.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f01003006"/>
<p>clearing</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>A large amount of malaria about Palmerville and Badin itself has<lb/>
been destroyed by the Pond. In the Beaver Dam Creek section, however, including Glady Fork, it has been increased. As Palmersville and Badin<lb/>
are thickly settled--and the other section rather sparsely--the good<lb/>
overbalanced the evil, yet it was the factor of amount of population<lb/>
that did this, as I heard that practically every house in the Beaver<lb/>
Dam Creek section claimed to have malaria. I don't think any measures<lb/>
that are practicable can give much control at Badin. LePrince and my-<lb/>
self advised Mr. Martin before the Pond was made to purchase all the<lb/>
land at a reasonable distance from the Pond: that we saw no means of<lb/>


reasonable control of malaria in this section. I, of course, could<lb/>
live there in a screened house with safety, but those who did live there<lb/>
couldn't. Oiling log-jams would help, of course. In ordinary summer<lb/>
weather, 14 days is the Maximum interval for good work. I doubt if the<lb/>
introduction of Gambusia now could give anything but a temporary bene-<lb/>
fit. The Pond is six years old. If they were introduced early and in<lb/>
a number of places they should then have reached their normal limit in<lb/>
the Pond long before this and while the introduction of large numbers<lb/>
would temporarily raise this limit in the places where introduced, yet<lb/>
the number would soon fall to the normal and no permanent good be done.</p>
<p>I don't want to criticise Dr. Moore, but while intravenous in-<lb/>
jection is the quickest way to cure an attack of malaria, it is quite<lb/>
troublesome and is certainly no more efficacious than quinine by the<lb/>
mouth. Of course, if one could get the people to take quinine one could<lb/>
control malaria--possibly eliminate it--but they won't, and there's an<lb/>
end to it.</p>
