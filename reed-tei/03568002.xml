<salute>My dear Hutch:</salute>
</opener>
<p>As I think I told you, I had another paper to finish before starting the<lb/>
yellow fever story. I will finish this within the week and will at once start on<lb/>
the yellow fever job. I shall send to you a preliminary copy to show you what it<lb/>
is all about and will ask your help in writing a half-dozen different individuals.<lb/>
As you know, the Cubans are given to doing things &ldquo;manana,&rdquo; and three or four well<lb/>
placed letters from you will help matters tremendously. Also I want to write <unclear>a</unclear><lb/>
couple letters--one to Mr. Pew in Pennsylvania, and one to a couple of others who<lb/>
have been helping me. One of the men, who has some vital information concerning the<lb/>
fact that Lazear got deliberate and not accidental yellow fever, is always out on me<lb/>
for personal reasons, and I think a letter from you will be helpful. I shall explain<lb/>
this all in a few days.</p>
<p>I do not know what possible connection Doctor Barker of Hopkins would have<lb/>
had with Lazear that would interest us. He, of course, has been at Hopkins for a<lb/>
long time and may have been a student or instructor or something when Lazear was<lb/>
around there; but after Lazear got into yellow fever work, Barker had no connection<lb/>
with him I am sure, and all that he knows is probably second-hand. I am sure that<lb/>
Barker was never in Havana, and, of course, Lazear was there from the time of this<lb/>
work until his death, so Barker would have no association with him. Reed was quite<lb/>
a friend of Welch while he was at Hopkins, and I believe there is a certain amount<lb/>
of &ldquo;Reediana&rdquo; at Hopkins. I intend to find out about this, but I am not anticipating<lb/>
much help from Barker.</p>
