<p>Last<lb/>
Monday evening, I anxiously<lb/>
awaited the arrival of your<lb/>
letter &amp; my heart beat right<lb/>
merrily, as the declining day<lb/>
wore away. Alas! the mes-<lb/>
senger came, but no letter<lb/>
for me: so I heaved a sigh,<lb/>
declared the regular mail<lb/>
communications were impos-<lb/>
sible, &amp; hence not to be expec-<lb/>
ted, and went to my din-<lb/>
ner- Returning, I took up <hi>my</hi><lb/>
(<hi>your</hi>) French grammar, feeling<lb/>
that, to hold in my hands a<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01719002"/>
volume whose leaves had been<lb/>
so often turned by your<lb/>
precious little fingers, would<lb/>
bring me as near to <hi>you</hi> as<lb/>
possible. And sure enough,<lb/>
it was quite a satisfac-<lb/>
tion to observe, here &amp; there,<lb/>
scattered throughout the book,<lb/>
&ldquo;foot-prints&rdquo; of my little Emilie-<lb/>
or if not exactly &ldquo;foot-prints,&rdquo;<lb/>
<hi>hand</hi>-prints, which, by the way,<lb/>
you were so cruel <add>as</add> to erase<lb/>
before consigning it to my care.<lb/>
In spite of the fact that they<lb/>
were all pretty well erased,<lb/>
I had the pleasure of puz-<lb/>
zling my brain in the attempt<lb/>
to dec<del>h</del>ipher them. I found<lb/>
two or three short sentences<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01719003"/>
that were not erased at all,<lb/>
&amp; they were all composed of<lb/>
the same number of words,<lb/>
&amp; the <hi>same</hi> words. Although<lb/>
I agreed with the sentiment<lb/>
expressed by those words, I<lb/>
don't know that I can tell<lb/>
you, just yet, what they were.<lb/>
Of course, you don't remember<lb/>
them, &amp; haven't the remotest<lb/>
curiosity to be informed<lb/>
whether I shall relent &amp; tell<lb/>
you or not, this much I will<lb/>
confide to you- that it was, &amp;<lb/>
is, the greatest pleasure to<lb/>
be permitted to study a for-<lb/>
eign tongue out of the very<lb/>
identical &ldquo;tome&rdquo; that <add>has</add> so often<lb/>
met the gaze of my little love's<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01719004"/>
eyes, &amp; perhaps brought a frown<lb/>
to my little darling's brow! In-<lb/>
deed, I feel &amp; know that <add>the</add> very<lb/>
same portions of the work that<lb/>
puzzled <hi>you</hi>, must necessa-<lb/>
rily give me most trouble.<lb/>
It couldn't be otherwise, my<lb/>
sweet Em, <hi>so much alike</hi><lb/>
are <hi>we</hi> in mind - albeit,<lb/>
to <hi>tease me</hi>, you occasionly<lb/>
<hi>deny</hi> that there is any sim-<lb/>
ilarity; but I understand that<lb/>
you don't mean it, or else<lb/>
I should be very much teased.<lb/>
Really, I believe I had almost<lb/>
forgotten to tell you what<lb/>
I started out to relate, &amp;<lb/>
that was concerning your<lb/>
last letter- Well, as I said, I<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01719005"/>
studied my lesson in French,<lb/>
&amp; then went up stairs to<lb/>
my room to read an hour<lb/>
or two before retiring.<lb/>
Sometime after 9 o'clock, a voice<lb/>
summoned me from below,<lb/>
to the effect that there was a<lb/>
letter down stairs for me,<lb/>
and sure enough, on descen-<lb/>
ding, I found your precious<lb/>
letter on a remote corner<lb/>
of the table, just where it<lb/>
had been quietly reposing<lb/>
since 5 o'clock! The orderly,<lb/>
it seems, had, contrary to his<lb/>
usual custom, divided the letters<lb/>
&amp; papers in to two packages &amp;<lb/>
scattered them around gen-<lb/>
erally- I cannot tell you,<lb/>
my love, how sweet that<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01719006"/>
letter was to my longing eyes, &amp; how I pressed<lb/>
it to my heart, when I had again reached<lb/>
my room! God <hi>bless</hi> you, for the sweet<lb/>
assurances that it contained! If aught<lb/>
my previous letter contained has contrib-<lb/>
uted to your happiness, know, my darling,<lb/>
that the knowledge of the very fact that<lb/>
I have caused your heart to beat more<lb/>
happily, <hi>this</hi> has yielded me, as <hi>nothing</hi><lb/>
else on earth can give, comfort &amp; joy<lb/>
such as I have never known!</p>
<p>Yesterday, for the first time within 4 weeks, I<lb/>
visited New York City, &amp; spent the greater part<lb/>
of the day in Central Park, feasting on the<lb/>
loneliness &amp; grandeur of Nature as well as<lb/>
the wonders of Art. My trip did me much<lb/>
good, as it was the first day's relaxation I<lb/>
had taken since my return from M'boro- Strolling<lb/>
down Broadway, late in the afternoon, I dropped into<lb/>
Carleton's Publishing House, and as a result of what I<lb/>
saw, I send you by, to-day's, mail a little vol. called &ldquo;Flor-<lb/>
al Decoration of Dwelling Houses&rdquo;-which I trust may be of interest- The<lb/>
sentences in the grammar were, &ldquo;I love you, Emilie&rdquo;- and <hi>I do</hi>, with <hi>all</hi> my <hi>heart</hi>-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Ever your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
