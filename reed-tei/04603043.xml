Colonel J. F. Siler, President<lb/>
Walter Reed Memorial Association<lb/>
1835 Eye Street N.W.<lb/>
Washington 6, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Siler:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Permit me to send to you as President of the Walter Reed Memorial Associa-<lb/>
tion, a copy of a long letter which was written primarily for relatives of those<lb/>
honored at the dedication of Camp Lazear. I think a copy should be in the<lb/>
files of the Walter Reed Memorial Association. If per chance you or General<lb/>
Love should wish an extra copy, we could have them made for you as they are<lb/>
ozalid copies.</p>
<p>It was extremely important to have the Walter Reed Memorial Association<lb/>
represented on this occasion. I had intended to give myself the honor of<lb/>
placing the wreath for the Association but because of the absence of General<lb/>
Streit and one or two others I had to place two wreaths before that of the<lb/>
Walter Reed Memorial Association was to be placed. Therefore an even better<lb/>
representative for the Association was provided by Ambassador Beaulac in the<lb/>
person of Lt. Colonel Vincent M. Elmore, Army Attache of the U. S. Embassy<lb/>
in Cuba. In view of the military rank of Walter Reed, it was more appropriate<lb/>
to have Colonel Elmore place the wreath than to have a civilian do this.</p>
<p>The cost of each wreath was $15. They were really very lovely and would<lb/>
have cost two or three times that much here. They were purchased from<lb/>
&ldquo;Milagros Flores,&rdquo; Lucila Schumann, President, who gave me only one bill<lb/>
itemizing each wreath and institutional donor. If you need an ozalid copy<lb/>
I can send it. Otherwise I should be glad to receive a check for $15 at your<lb/>
convenience.</p>
<p>I realize that the Walter Reed Memorial Association has limited funds which<lb/>
should be reserved almost exclusively for the present purposed but I think<lb/>
that our association should have a fairly complete list of the photographs.<lb/>
Quite a few were taken of various parts of the ceremony, perhaps 50 or so. I<lb/>
shall try to borrow all of the films and present to the Association at least<lb/>
small copies of each. These only cost a few cents each but at the moment<lb/>
(facing the ides of March and the tax collector) I do not believe I can send<lb/>
you 50 enlargements which would run to $75 or so but I do want you, General<lb/>
Love, the Reeds and Mrs. Kean to see the pictures.</p>
