<salute>My dear Mrs. Ames:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was so glad to receive from Mr. George Kellogg your address.<lb/>
For some time I have known of the work of your husband and indeed was one of<lb/>
those who proposed that your husband be included in the painting &ldquo;Conquerors<lb/>
of Yellow Fever.&rdquo; Permit me to send you a couple of reprints which will evi-<lb/>
dence my interest in the story of yellow fever. I have uncovered so much un-<lb/>
published material concerning the conquest of yellow fever that the Mayo Clinic<lb/>
has authorized me to proceed with the publication of a book thereon and I am<lb/>
collecting further data now.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago in Washington I visited Mrs. Walter Reed and her<lb/>
family, certain relatives of Dr. Lazear, General Kean, General Ireland and others.<lb/>
Mrs. Blossom Reed let me copy all her father's letters that were available. La-<lb/>
zear's family uncovered many letters of Dr. Lazear, written from Cuba to his<lb/>
mother, and gave these to me. Here and there I have found old photographs of<lb/>
Camp Lazear, Camp Columbia, etc. Returning from Chicago I visited Gust. Lambert<lb/>
for three or four hours. He especially told me of the splendid work of your<lb/>
husband and showed me a photograph of him. I am sorry indeed that none of us<lb/>
knew your address or the whereabouts of the photograph. Otherwise, I am sure<lb/>
Mr. Cornwell would have made a better likeness of him in the painting.</p>
<p>I learned from Mr. Lambert more about your husband's work than<lb/>
I had learned elsewhere and I am taking the liberty of writing you asking for<lb/>
further help. As I understand it, you have some letters between him and Walter<lb/>
Reed and others, one letter concerning your husband's work; also certain newspaper<lb/>
clippings and articles. Do you have any old photographs of Camp Lazear, Camp<lb/>
Columbia, Columbia Barracks, etc. I would greatly appreciate it if you would be<lb/>
willing to lend these to me, sending them by registered insured mail at my ex-<lb/>
pense. I will have them carefully photostated or photographed here and will return<lb/>
the material intact to you. This would be a wonderful help to me and it is the<lb/>
only way that I know of that I can get a clear understanding of the important<lb/>
contribution which your husband made to this work. I note in your letter to Mr.<lb/>
Kellogg that one of your sons and a daughter are physicians and I am therefore<lb/>
sending three or four extra reprints, thinking they might like to have them.<lb/>
Should you wish more, I shall be delighted to send them.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
