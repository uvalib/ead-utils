<salute>My little darling;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I know<lb/>
very well that ere this frag-<lb/>
ment arrives at a certain<lb/>
town, celebrated in prose &amp;<lb/>
poetry, I will have received<lb/>
a good scolding for keep-<lb/>
ing you in suspense for so<lb/>
long a time- Why to think, that<lb/>
almost a whole week, <hi>seven<lb/>
days</hi>, will pass before you<lb/>
hear a word from your own<lb/>
little boy! My! <hi>won't</hi> I get<lb/>
<hi>such</hi> a lecture! &ldquo;Sister, why<lb/>
don't Dr Reed write me a<lb/>
letter? I think he is the <hi>poor-<lb/>
est</hi> correspondent in the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01708002"/>
world! I don't intend to answer<lb/>
his letter when it comes,&rdquo; etc<lb/>
etc. Pardon my conceit, my dar-<lb/>
ling, if such it be; but since<lb/>
you have a tender feeling<lb/>
for the writer, I am sure that<lb/>
the above is just what you<lb/>
said- And I can't find fault<lb/>
with you for being a little im-<lb/>
patient- <hi>I</hi> know how very anx-<lb/>
ious <hi>I</hi> am, if the receipt of<lb/>
your letter is delayed for even<lb/>
one day- Bless your darling<lb/>
little heart! You deserve<lb/>
much praise <add>for</add> your prompt-<lb/>
ness in writing to me, ever<lb/>
since I've been at Willet's<lb/>
Point; and I, herewith, re-<lb/>
turn you the sincerest thanks<lb/>
of a loving heart. This<lb/>
token of your affection<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01708003"/>
does not pass unregarded,<lb/>
but is treasured up in my<lb/>
heart- and with pride &amp;<lb/>
pleasure, I welcome the fact<lb/>
that one of the purest, swee-<lb/>
test girls, on Earth, values<lb/>
my friendship sufficiently<lb/>
to write to me, once a week.<lb/>
In this connection, I often feel<lb/>
ashamed of myself when I<lb/>
have permitted the time to<lb/>
glide by, which should<lb/>
have been devoted to you,<lb/>
my little sweet-heart! Still,<lb/>
in spite of my best resolves,<lb/>
this often occurs, &amp; at other<lb/>
times, I am compelled by cir-<lb/>
cumstances. Again, I feel so<lb/>
little in the mood for writing<lb/>
that I can't string two ideas<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01708004"/>
together, so as to make good<lb/>
sense of them- Doubtless,<lb/>
you have already noticed<lb/>
this, and it is useless for me<lb/>
to call your attention to the<lb/>
fact- You know that this must<lb/>
be, &amp; is, true, to a greater or<lb/>
less extent, with every one,<lb/>
&amp; I am no exception to the rule.<lb/>
While this is the case, &amp; while<lb/>
I am, at times, prevented from<lb/>
writing, yet it is equally<lb/>
true, that whatever the frame<lb/>
of my mind may be, or what-<lb/>
ever work my hand may find<lb/>
to do, I still have time to <hi>think</hi><lb/>
of <hi>you</hi>! And this I do <hi>always</hi>!<lb/>
Hour after hour, day or night,<lb/>
working or idling, still do<lb/>
my thoughts turn to <hi>thee</hi>, Emilie!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01708005"/>
Yes, &amp; I may add, even in my<lb/>
<del>dre</del> sleeping moments, when<lb/>
my thoughts are turned adrift,<lb/>
to roam where e're they will,<lb/>
<hi>often</hi> do they lead me to your<lb/>
side! Nor could there be a<lb/>
truer test, than this, to show<lb/>
about what dear object<lb/>
my waking thoughts delight<lb/>
to cling- Time after time, have<lb/>
I dreamed that I was by<lb/>
your side, even within the<lb/>
past week- I would hear<lb/>
your sweet voice as plainly<lb/>
as if it was not a dream,<lb/>
and only the arrival of morn,<lb/>
<hi>Cruel</hi> morn, would break the<lb/>
delightful spell! Why, I<lb/>
dreamed, recently, that you<lb/>
were telling me <del>that</del> about<lb/>
some young gentleman<lb/>
that had <hi>proposed</hi> to you!<lb/>
And we had a jolly time, laugh-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01708006"/>
ing over his embarrassment-<lb/>
Doubtless you will say that I<lb/>
<add>was</add> dreaming of <hi>my own</hi> confusion<lb/>
on a certain occasion. At an-<lb/>
other time, I dreamed that we<lb/>
were travelling abroad, visit-<lb/>
ing together &amp; admiring the<lb/>
wonders of Europe. Of course,<lb/>
this only goes to show that<lb/>
<hi>we will</hi> do this, sometime in<lb/>
the Future. You know, we<lb/>
have set our hearts on this,<lb/>
my darling, &amp; we <hi>must</hi> do it.<lb/>
These &amp; others I mi<del>e</del>ght relate,<lb/>
all of which proves plainer<lb/>
than words, that <hi>you</hi> are<lb/>
<hi>never</hi> absent from my<lb/>
mind-! Absent from my<lb/>
thoughts! How could it be,<lb/>
when, day by day, my love<lb/>
increases! When I addressed <add>you</add><lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01708007"/>
I thought that I loved you,<lb/>
and I am <hi>sure</hi> that I <hi>did</hi>;<lb/>
as much as any gentleman<lb/>
ever loved under the same<lb/>
circumstances -- but when<lb/>
I feel the full force of the<lb/>
boundless love that fills<lb/>
&amp; warms my heart, <hi>now</hi>,<lb/>
I am <add>not</add> forced to admit, but<lb/>
rather do I <hi>gladly confess</hi><lb/>
that there can be no com-<lb/>
parison between the two<lb/>
conditions of my mind-<lb/>
If this be so, who can<lb/>
measure my love, when<lb/>
I shall fold you in my<lb/>
arms &amp; call you -- <hi>wife</hi>!</p>
<closer>
<salute>Ever, my own darling,<lb/>
your fond &amp; devoted<lb/>
</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.

P.S.<lb/>
    In my next letter, I'll tell you<lb/>
    when I am coming <del>to your</del><lb/>
    to see you -- &amp; it won't be very<lb/>
    long from this time. W.
