<p>TRYING TO REWARD<lb/>
A GREAT HERO</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Risked Life in Yellow Fever Ex-<lb/>
periments; Proved <unclear>Mosqui</unclear><lb/>
Carries the Disease<unclear>,</unclear></p>
<p>Washington, May 7.--A hopeless<lb/>
paralytic, supported by the earn-<lb/>
ings of his faithful wife by<lb/>
work over the washtub and the iron-<lb/>
ing board, is the man who risked his<lb/>
life and lost his health to demonstrate<lb/>
a medical principle that has saved<lb/>
thousands of lives in the past few<lb/>
years.</p>
<p>That man is John R. Kissinger. He<lb/>
gave himself into the hands of United<lb/>
States Army doctors for experiments<lb/>
to prove the principle that yellow<lb/>
fever is spread by mosquitoes; and his<lb/>
helpless condition to-day is believed to<lb/>
be due to the experiments made upon<lb/>
him at that time.</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Pensions<lb/>
has heard an appeal from Mr. Kissinger<lb/>
for help from the Government, in con-<lb/>
sideration of his contribution to medi-<lb/>
cal science, and it has reported a<lb/>
bill granting a pension of $125 per<lb/>
month to him. The bill specifies that<lb/>
this large pension is paid in recogni-<lb/>
tion of Kissinger's &ldquo;eminent service<lb/>
rendered, suffering endured and per-<lb/>
manent disabilities contracted by him<lb/>
in the interest of humanity and sci-<lb/>
ence as a volunteer subject for experi-<lb/>
ment in yellow fever hospital in Cuba,<lb/>
wherein was demonstrated on his own<lb/>
person the truth of the theory of the<lb/>
transmission and propagation of yel-<lb/>
low fever infected by mosquitoes, and<lb/>
whereby was discovered the cause of<lb/>
such transmission and proper means of<lb/>
preventing said infection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tributes for Heroism.</p>
<p>Of Kissinger the Senate Committee<lb/>
on Pensions has said in a report to the<lb/>
Senate that he was one of the bravest<lb/>
soldiers who served in the Spanish-<lb/>
American war. And of him Dr. Walter<lb/>
Reed, the physician in charge of the<lb/>
experiments, said: &ldquo;In my opinion, this<lb/>
exhibition of moral courage has <unclear>never</unclear><lb/>
been surpassed in the annals of the<lb/>
army of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other tributes to Kissinger are paid<lb/>
in the report of Senator Shivley, of In-<lb/>
id,ana, made in behalf of the Commit-<lb/>
tee on Pensions, to the Senate. It is, in<lb/>
part, as follows:</p>
<p>"For exhibition of moral courage,<lb/>
Kissinger's submission to inoculation<lb/>
of yellow fever seems unsurpassed. He<lb/>
is now a helpless paralytic, unable to<lb/>
walk, and he is totally disabled for any<lb/>
kind of employment, his ailment being<lb/>
myelitis, or disease of the spine, and <unclear>it</unclear><lb/>
is the result of experiments made upon<lb/>
him when he volunteered to become a<lb/>
subject for experimental purposes in<lb/>
the yellow fever hospital in Cuba. At<lb/>
the time he made the sacrifice he was<lb/>
a private in the Hospital Corps of the<lb/>
army, in which he enlisted November<lb/>
15, 1898. When he was finally dis-<lb/>
charged from the hospital he was ap-<lb/>
pointed as acting hospital steward and<lb/>
served as such until the date of his<lb/>
discharge, November 14, 1901. Previous<lb/>
to his enlistment he served in Com-<lb/>
pany D, One Hundred and Fifty-sev-<lb/>
enth Indiana Volunteer Infantry, from<lb/>
<unclear>April 28, 1898</unclear> to November 1, 1898,<lb/>
having enlisted <unclear>immediately</unclear> at the<lb/>
breaking out of the war <unclear>with Spain</unclear><lb/>
and in response to President McKin-<lb/>
ley's call for troops.</p>
<p>Members of Commission.</p>
<p>"The commission that investigated the<lb/>
mosquito theory of transmission of yel-<lb/>
low fever in the Fall of 1900 was com-<lb/>
posed of Drs. Walter Reed, James Car-<lb/>
roll and Jesse W. Lazear. From a book<lb/>
entitled &lsquo;Walter Reed and Yellow Fever,&rsquo;<lb/>
by Howard W. Kelly, professor of sur-<lb/>
gery of the Johns Hopkins University,<lb/>
published in New York by McClure, Phil-<lb/>
lips &amp; Co., on page 139, is the following<lb/>
paragraph in regard to this soldier:</p>
<p>"'The subject of the first experiment<lb/>
was a young private from Ohio, named<lb/>
John R. Kissinger, who volunteered for<lb/>
the service, to use his own words, &ldquo;solely<lb/>
in the interest of humanity, and the<lb/>
cause of science.&rdquo; When it became known<lb/>
among the troops that subjects were<lb/>
needed for experimental purposes Kis-<lb/>
singer, in company with another young<lb/>
private named John J. Moran, also from<lb/>
Ohio, volunteered their services. Dr.<lb/>
Reed talked the matter over with them,<lb/>
explaining fully the danger and suffering<lb/>
involved in the experiment should it be<lb/>
successful, and then, seeing they were<lb/>
determined, he stated that a definite<lb/>
money compensation would be made<lb/>
them. Both young men declined to ac-<lb/>
cept, making it, indeed, their sole stipu-<lb/>
lation that they should receive no pe-<lb/>
cuniary reward, whereupon Major Reed<lb/>
touched his cap, saying, respectfully:<lb/>
&ldquo;Gentlemen, I salute you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"He is now receiving a pension of but<lb/>
$12 per month, and he can obtain no<lb/>
further relief because he is unable to fur-<lb/>
nish direct testimony tracing his present<lb/>
grievous condition back to yellow fever<lb/>
in the army, although there is but little<lb/>
doubt that the relation of the cause and<lb/>
effect exists. Since his discharge he has<lb/>
never been in good health, which he at<lb/>
first attributed to slow recovery from that<lb/>
disease, thinking that with the passing of<lb/>
time his constitution would enable him to<lb/>
throw it off. He continued to fail, how-<lb/>
ever, and is now a helpless paralytic. In<lb/>
the meantime he had married and is now<lb/>
supported by his small pension and laun-<lb/>
dry work done by his wife and contribu-<lb/>
tions to his support by a few people who<lb/>
appreciate his services to humanity.</p>
<p>"A bill to grant him a pension of $30<lb/>
per month passed the House during the<lb/>
session of the Fifty-ninth Congress, but<lb/>
by mistake the rate was cut to $12 per<lb/>
month, at which amount it was finally<lb/>
approved. In his present helpless condi-<lb/>
tion it is believed that he is entitled to<lb/>
a highly substantial measure of relief,<lb/>
his disability seemingly being due to<lb/>
causes of service origin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In view of the fact that a pension or<lb/>
annuity of $125 per month was granted<lb/>
to the widows of Drs. <hi>Labear</hi> and Car-<lb/>
roll, who conducted these experiments<lb/>
with yellow fever infected mosquitoes,<lb/>
your committee are of the opinion that<lb/>
as great consideration should be given<lb/>
to the man who braved the danger and<lb/>
who, while he escaped with his life,<lb/>
is so helplessly crippled that he is unable<lb/>
to do anything to care for himself, as to<lb/>
the widows of Drs. Lazear and Carroll.&rdquo;</p>
