<salute>My sweet, sweet Invalid:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is<lb/>
nearly eight o'clock, Thursday<lb/>
evening- I have just come from<lb/>
the dinner-table, where we<lb/>
sat &amp; chatted for more than<lb/>
an hour after our meal was<lb/>
finished- By the way, our<lb/>
soldier cook gave us banana<lb/>
Ice-cream, -- the first I ever<lb/>
tasted -- and you can't imagine<lb/>
how delicious it was- It<lb/>
seemed to taste somewhat<lb/>
of <hi>strawberry</hi>- I suppose it<lb/>
was due to the flavor of the<lb/>
&ldquo;apple&rdquo; banana, of which it was<lb/>
made- Our mess is better<lb/>
than when I came, but its<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02228002"/>
monotony prevents it from<lb/>
being as appetizing as one<lb/>
could wish- Still I always<lb/>
manage to eat too much, espec-<lb/>
ially for the <add>little</add> exercise I take-<lb/>
If I don't look sharp, <hi>I</hi>, too,<lb/>
will be coming down with<lb/>
the <hi>gout</hi>, like my poor, sweet-<lb/>
afflicted wifie- Your account<lb/>
of your little walk to Dupont<lb/>
Circle and your trying to hobble<lb/>
back, with so much difficulty,<lb/>
made me so sad the whole<lb/>
afternoon- I had thought of<lb/>
you as recovering rapidly, --<lb/>
as going to the market for<lb/>
roses and to the theatre for<lb/>
fun; but that experience<lb/>
as afforded by your trip to<lb/>
Dupont Circle don't look<lb/>
as if my sweet wifie was<lb/>
getting along very fast-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02228003"/>
still sweetheart, if you can<lb/>
sleep from <hi>nine</hi> to <hi>seven</hi> o'clock,<lb/>
that is something to be thank-<lb/>
ful for- I trust that your next<lb/>
letter will tell me that your<lb/>
darling foot is much better.<lb/>
November <hi>was</hi> a &ldquo;cracker-Jack&rdquo;<lb/>
month for expenses, wasn't it<lb/>
my joy? I expected as much-<lb/>
Perhaps December's won't be<lb/>
quite as much, although <hi>Christ-<lb/>
mas</hi> is apt to carry the fig-<lb/>
ures pretty high. As long as<lb/>
it was all spent for a good<lb/>
purpose, it is alright- I sent<lb/>
<add>you</add> on Monday a check for <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>258.34,<lb/>
which will bring your account<lb/>
to <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>596.92, and I have sufficient to<lb/>
increase it to <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>750.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi>- so that per-<lb/>
haps we will start the new year<lb/>
with <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>800<hi rend="superscript">00</hi>. This will be quite<lb/>
satisfactory, considering the<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02228004"/>
large amount that we have<lb/>
expended on Keewaydin during<lb/>
the present year. If we live<lb/>
and have good luck, we will in-<lb/>
crease this <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>800 to <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>1800 by Dec.<lb/>
31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of next year, and then by<lb/>
May 1902 we can yet begin<lb/>
on that darling house at<lb/>
our sweet mountain home.<lb/>
That is all that I want to<lb/>
save any money for- Just so<lb/>
that I can make a delight-<lb/>
ful home for my two sweet,<lb/>
sweetest girls- After that has<lb/>
been accomplished, it can all<lb/>
go- You just <hi>hurry</hi> up and<lb/>
get <hi>well</hi>, my sweet wifie, and<lb/>
never mind about the expenses<lb/>
for November! who wrote<lb/>
Eben Holden concerning which<lb/>
you spoke? Mrs. Humphrey<lb/>
<unclear>warf</unclear>? I have never read it-<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02228005"/>
Do pray get all the books you<lb/>
want to read, for it is the<lb/>
greatest of all pleasures-<lb/>
I am very glad that darling<lb/>
little heart is going to Anap-<lb/>
olis for Christmas week- I<lb/>
know that she will have a very<lb/>
enjoyable time with Helen,<lb/>
although I understood her to<lb/>
say that Helen was going<lb/>
to spend Christmas in George-<lb/>
town- Our sweet baby must<lb/>
be careful about taking the<lb/>
right train for Anapolis-<lb/>
I am afraid that my precious<lb/>
wifie will have a very dull<lb/>
Christmas all by her sweet<lb/>
self. It's too bad that her<lb/>
Mr Mantee can't be there to<lb/>
make a little fun for her- If<lb/>
he is not there, it won't be<lb/>
his fault, however. If I wasn't<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02228006"/>
doing this work, I would be<lb/>
at some Military Garrison<lb/>
where my sweet wifie wouldn't<lb/>
want to come- I really had<lb/>
to chuckle over my darling wifie's<lb/>
fears that somebody might<lb/>
die in the Camp and bring me<lb/>
into disgrace- What I begin<lb/>
to fear is not that somebody<lb/>
<hi>will</hi> get sick, but <add>rather</add> that some-<lb/>
body <hi>will not</hi> get sick!<lb/>
Those slight fevers that I men-<lb/>
tioned in my last letter, didn't<lb/>
turn out to be anything of im-<lb/>
portance- Still I am not<lb/>
discouraged, but shall keep<lb/>
pegging away, hoping for<lb/>
better results after a while-<lb/>
Now, go to bed, my sweet joys,<lb/>
and dream until morning, and<lb/>
old Mr Mantee will try to do<lb/>
the same! Boo! Boo! you Joys.<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02228007"/>
<hi>Friday night</hi> - <hi>Dec. 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>. What a<lb/>
wet, dreary day this has been!<lb/>
Rain, rain, rain, and the heaviest<lb/>
thickest of clouds have hung<lb/>
over us -- and last night<lb/>
was such a beautiful,<lb/>
moonlit night -- as clear<lb/>
and beautiful as I ever<lb/>
saw- We were beginning<lb/>
to have the dust on the<lb/>
roads &amp; hence the rain comes<lb/>
in nicely to lay this and I dare<lb/>
say that the Cuban Farmers<lb/>
need it for their winter<lb/>
crops. It seems funny to<lb/>
speak of this as winter, when<lb/>
it is in reality milder than<lb/>
our may in Washington- I<lb/>
shouldn't like it always,<lb/>
as I would long for an oc-<lb/>
casional cold snap, just to make<lb/>
one's blood tingle a little bit-<lb/>
You know, lovie, dear, that I<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02228008"/>
surprise myself with my<lb/>
ability to take the cold shower-<lb/>
baths here, which I do every<lb/>
morning upon arising- I find<lb/>
them so refreshing &amp; so <hi>awake<lb/>
-ning</hi>, as it were! We must have<lb/>
one at dear Keewaydin one<lb/>
of these days.</p>
<p><hi>Saturday morning</hi> - <hi>8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>. Another<lb/>
cloudy, blustering day- I am<lb/>
afraid that the weather in the<lb/>
U.S. has been smacking of<lb/>
winter- Do pray, precious<lb/>
heart, keep wrapped up<lb/>
warm and don't venture out<lb/>
when it is cold- How is that<lb/>
fat, gouty toe anyway? Am<lb/>
looking for a letter, this morning,<lb/>
to tell me that my dear little<lb/>
sufferer is so much better-<lb/>
Make precious Scholar wrap<lb/>
up warm, too- Take care of<lb/>
your darling selves- Kisses and<lb/>
love &amp; love &amp; kisses for my good sweet,<lb/>
precious girls-</p>
