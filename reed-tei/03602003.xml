<salute>My dear Doctor Cooke:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am delighted to hear from you, and I am so pleased that you were<lb/>
willing to give me further information. I find that the very few copies of my mem-<lb/>
orandum which I had typed are exhausted, since I sent one to Moran, and to two others<lb/>
concerned in Havana, one to General Kean and one to General Truby. I expect one of<lb/>
those back shortly and will hasten to send it to you, as I am most anxious to have<lb/>
your comments after reading it. With it, I will send you a number of photographs,<lb/>
old and new, and will take the liberty of asking you certain questions, hoping that<lb/>
you can give me specific answers.</p>
<p>I think you are entirely too modest regarding the part you played.<lb/>
When you volunteered to spend three weeks in the Infected Clothing Building, as far<lb/>
as you and the world were concerned, you were accepting probable death. Nobody knew<lb/>
for sure that infected clothing was not the source of yellow fever, and the world<lb/>
will see fit to appraise your actions at a higher value than you so modestly have.</p>
<p>In the meantime, until you receive my memorandum, I would appreciate<lb/>
it greatly if you would write down three or four or more pages, in as much detail as<lb/>
you wish, regarding your own experiences. I should love to quote these directly in<lb/>
my talk. I am anxious to have your confirmation as to the two volunteers who spent the<lb/>
first period with you in the Infected Clothing Building, and a little more specific<lb/>
information as to just how you handled these volunteers. I understand you slept in<lb/>
the building at night after unpacking the infected clothing and bedding. Were these<lb/>
hung around the walls, or in just what manner? It was Moran's impression that you more<lb/>
or less occupied an adjacent tent during the day. Did you eat meals with the regular<lb/>
group or were your meals brought to you? Any possible details regarding your experiences<lb/>
I would be most grateful to have, and I can assure you that they will be used with dig-<lb/>
nity and to your entire satisfaction, and that before I publish a single line, you<lb/>
will have the opportunity to see and criticize my remarks.</p>

<salute>Most sincerely,</salute>
