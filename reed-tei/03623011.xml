Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
MAYO CLINIC,<lb/>
Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am inclosing statements, declarations, observations, etc.<lb/>
made by Sra. Maria Teresa Loma Vda. de Rojas and by Dr. Perez Beato,<lb/>
translated from Spanish by Mrs. Phillips. The latter, unfortunately,<lb/>
did not make a very good translation and notwithstanding my caution that<lb/>
the translation be made verbatim, she corrected the entries as written<lb/>
by Dr. Rojas in his Journal, correcting proper names, such as that of<lb/>
&ldquo;Lezar&rdquo; to read &ldquo;Lazear&rdquo;. In his entries, Dr. Rojas did not spell the<lb/>
name correctly until that for September 29, 1901, where he uses, for the first<lb/>
time and correctly the name of Lazear and the name of the Camp in English,<lb/>
&ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo;. Also, the first check received by him, January 2, 1901,<lb/>
was remitted to him by Major Reed, whose surname he spelled &ldquo;Read&rdquo;. In the<lb/>
entries for September 29, 1901, and October 1, 1901, the name Lazear is<lb/>
spelled correctly, not so in the previous entries. You get what I mean.<lb/>
I wanted Mrs. Phillips to <hi>mis-spel</hi> in the translation what Dr. Rojas mis-<lb/>
spelled in his own handwriting. She evidently overlooked that little detail<lb/>
and I did not want to trouble her to do it all over again. I will try to<lb/>
get out a better translation and take it up with me. In the meantime, should<lb/>
you want to make use of the entries, you may take note of the preceding<lb/>
observations, if you are in accord with me that the original entries should<lb/>
not have been corrected or altered in any way.</p>
<p>What the shacks were used for and by whom they were occupied<lb/>
between October 9th, 1901, is not known. According to the record, Zun-<lb/>
zunegui's father did not take over the limekilns until March, 1907. Z.<lb/>
says he lived in the shacks from 1903 on. While his father may have<lb/>
been employed on the farm in some other capacity, without contract with<lb/>
Dr. Rojas, there is nothing to prove it. At the same time it is barely<lb/>
possible that his father was allowed, perhaps as a farmhand, to occupy the<lb/>
shack.</p>
<p>check<lb/>
2 <unclear>Sep</unclear> 1907</p>
<p>Will take the photostats up with me UNLESS YOU CABLE ME, ON<lb/>
RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER, TO AIRMAIL THEM TO YOU. In the meantime, I will<lb/>
have the entries properly translated, securing Sra. Rojas' signature to<lb/>
the translations, if at all possible.</p>
