Dr. Wickliffe Rose, General Director,<lb/>
International Health Board,<lb/>
61 Broadway,<lb/>
New York, N. Y.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Rose:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am returning the paper of Dr. White, received last evening, on<lb/>
-the Epidemiology and Prophylaxis of Yellow Fever. Your letter of Aug. 10th,<lb/>
with which it was enclosed, asks for an expression of opinion as to value<lb/>
of the article and criticism thereof.</p>
<p>For the first, the answer is easy. It should be valuable to &ldquo;the<lb/>
average Mexican practitioner,&rdquo; for whom it is intended, as it sets forth<lb/>
many facts in the epidemiology and prophylaxis of yellow fever clearly<lb/>
and simply.</p>
<p>For the second, except for the first paragraph, I would have no<lb/>
criticism to make.</p>
<p>Since, however, the writer purposes to confine himself to proven<lb/>
facts it is a question if it is proven</p>
<p>(1) That the man sick of yellow fever always ceases to be in-<lb/>
fective to mosquitoes after 72 hours.</p>
<p>(2) That the mosquito can never convey infection to another man<lb/>
until 12 days after her infecting meal.</p>
<p>(3) That the spirochete of Noguchi is the causative organism of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>For the 1st. there is <unclear>evi<add>d</add>cence</unclear>, negative necessarily, but I think<lb/>
it has not been generally considered proof.</p>
<p>For the 2nd. the same may be said. Note too that Noguchi has in-<lb/>
fected a guinea pig with Leptospira icteroides by a Stegomyia mosquito<lb/>
on the 8th. day after the infecting feeding. The presumption is that<lb/>
this insect would have infected a man on the same date.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00937006"/>
<p>date.</p>
<p>2/</p>
<p>For the 3rd., although I am inclined to accept L. icteroides as the<lb/>
causarive agent in yellow fever, yet other men, whose opinions should<lb/>
be of more value in this matter than mine--e. g. Welch: Rosenau: Noc:<lb/>
Guiteras--do not consider this matter proven. Indeed, the last is not<lb/>
only unconvinced, but well nigh convinced of the contrary, and while I<lb/>
think his opinion is at least partly due to an unconscious partisanship,<lb/>
yet it is as I have stated.</p>
<p>Would it then be fair to say that this postulate is generally ac-<lb/>
cepted as proven?</p>
<p>I would not have said so much on this, the 3rd., paragraph, but for<lb/>
the intention expressed in the 1st. one: &ldquo;to state only proven facts.&rdquo;<lb/>
To express this paragraph in accordance with the 1st. one, as I feel<lb/>
sure Dr. White intended, it might be written:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our experimental work we have not found the mosquito to con-<lb/>
vey the disease to man unless (1) she has bitten a yellow fever pa-<lb/>
tient during the first 72 hours of his illness and (2) there has been<lb/>
a delay of 12 days from this feeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(b) Page 1: Larvae are found in wells lined with brick or tile,<lb/>
but I presume both would be considered as stone.</p>
<p>(c) Page 2: See remarks on the 3rd. Par.</p>
<p>A few typographical errors are noted in pencil on the margin with<lb/>
(?) when there is any doubt.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
