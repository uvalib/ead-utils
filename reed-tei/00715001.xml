<salute>Dear Ma:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I had no trouble at all coming back until I<lb/>
reached Atlanta from there down the heat was dry &amp;<lb/>
disagreeable, but except for being tired I was well<lb/>
Sunday night; woke up with a dull headache &amp;<lb/>
could eat no breakfast, but felt fairly strong &amp; the<lb/>
head got well, If I had gone to bed at the<lb/>
hotel in Biloxi &amp; stayed 24 hours, <del>with</del> &amp; doctored<lb/>
myself, it might have been all right, I didn't<lb/>
<add>but</add> went aboard the Annie &amp; started out. The wind<lb/>
had been fair <del>&amp;</del><add>but</add> hauled dead ahead in<lb/>
about 35 minutes &amp; we reached our anchor-<lb/>
age <hi>out</hi> side of Chandeleur - because we c'd<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00715002"/>
not see to go in at 2 <hi>A. M.</hi> <del>Monday</del><add>Tuesday</add>. I began to<lb/>
feel sick about 2.30 P. M, Monday &amp; my head-<lb/>
ached so that I could not lie down &amp; I sat<lb/>
up in one corner of the cabin until nearly<lb/>
day when I fell asleep. It was cold also. Next<lb/>
morning, the tide being low, I was rowed<lb/>
ashore in a small boat 4 miles &amp; went<lb/>
straight to bed, &amp; I was pretty sick. Pains<lb/>
of all kinds &amp; descriptions, Fever, vomiting &amp; gener-<lb/>
al malaise. Yesterday afternoon was the first time<lb/>
I put on my breeches to sit up, &amp; until <add><del>Thursday</del></add> <del>Fri</del><lb/>
<add>Fri</add>day I <del>did</del><add>could</add> not even have the letter mail<lb/>
read to me, I think I was malarial &amp; the grip &amp;<lb/>
the fatigue developed it. Indeed I know<lb/>
it. I was pretty sick for 2 days, &amp; am no good<lb/>
yet.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00715003"/>
<p>In addition, I directed my clothes fumiga-<lb/>
ted &amp; <hi>all</hi> went in - I was too sick to think - &amp; my over-<lb/>
coat will have to be dyed &amp; the other one looks<lb/>
decidedly queer but is wearable</p>
<p><del>Just</del> Found the station in a fuss &amp; as soon as I can<lb/>
travel must go to Scranton - about 20 miles from<lb/>
Biloxi, to see a ship carpenter a trip I dread-<lb/>
at least the part from <del>here</del><add>this place</add> to Biloxi. It has<lb/>
been, &amp; is, rather a serious time with me.</p>
<p>Laura had fixed up your room &amp; had<lb/>
had the house fumigated to kill the<lb/>
roaches &amp; mice for you &amp; they all were disap-<lb/>
pointed. Henry has been having boils, but<lb/>
I hope will have no more. Edward seems to<lb/>
have charge of the house &amp; weeps bitterly<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00715004"/>
when I don't follow when he attempts to<lb/>
lead me. He has found out now that I can't<lb/>
&amp; doesn't mind so much. Was especially hurt at my<lb/>
not going to see the chickens of which he has 11<lb/>
- baby chickens- The two Lauras are well.</p>
<p>All the men save one whom, as I was sick, I was<lb/>
afraid to send are at Biloxi &amp; Ship Island<lb/>
with the barges &amp; will not be back un-<lb/>
til near the end of the week.</p>
<p>Enter Edward; who wants the ink.</p>

March 12/90<lb/>
getting better steadily &amp; not so slowly either, Hen-<lb/>
ry was espicially disappointed by you<lb/>
not coming &amp; even Ed says &ldquo;Gamma&rdquo;. Al<lb/>
though without much knowledge of what it<lb/>
means I suppose, only he thinks he should<lb/>
be rewarded by a pen &amp; ink for so doing,<lb/>
I am sorry I could not see Hill &amp; his people<lb/>
but it certainly was a visit which directed<lb/>
it self without any aid from me &amp; against<lb/>
all of my plans.<lb/>
I read the &ldquo;Counsel of Perfection&rdquo; on the train. It is, as a work<lb/>
of art, <hi>perfect</hi>. <del>He took</del> With <del>almost</del> <hi>no</hi> use of incident<lb/>
a very pleasant satisfactory book is produced. Not<lb/>
one<lb/>
thing<lb/>
in it which<lb/>
could have been<lb/>
left out, not one thing<lb/>
omitted which sh'd have been put it. The beginning, progress<lb/>
&amp; end are perfect. There is no waste in it &amp; nothing under-<lb/>
or over drawn.<lb/>
