<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The well packed &amp; sealed mms. came this<lb/>
P.M. in perfect condition. You evidently consider<lb/>
it more precious than I do, but of course<lb/>
I realize neither of <add>us</add> would like to have it lost.<lb/>
I wrote you on Sunday (12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>) and you no<lb/>
doubt have the letter by this time. One of<lb/>
the 4 letters mentioned evidently was lost for<lb/>
I certainly acknowledged receipt of the <unclear>W &amp; J</unclear><lb/>
program. If you cant find it I think it<lb/>
will come back to me in time as my<lb/>
name &amp; address is on the back, I may<lb/>
have misdirected it, but dont think so-</p>
<p>Under separate cover I will send<lb/>
you a photo. of myself taken when I<lb/>
retired in 1935. Compare this with the<lb/>
boy (Truby) in the photo. of the detatchment<lb/>
at Columbia Bks. in 1900- I will be 70<lb/>
in July '41-so I have a right to show a little<lb/>
age.</p>
<p>With the photo. I will also return your<lb/>
photos. of the model and <add>also</add> those which came with<lb/>
them in your long letter of Jan 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I took<lb/>
the liberty of cutting up one of the (model) photos.<lb/>
and have pasted <del><unclear>then</unclear></del><add><unclear><del>the</del></unclear> pieces</add> on a sheet of paper as<lb/>
they should be. I am delighted with the result.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06301027"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
for I can assure you that it is not for<lb/>
wrong- I wish you could <hi>send me<lb/>
a few copies</hi> of <unclear>each</unclear> of those photos.<lb/>
(model) so that I can <del>make</del><add><unclear>mount</unclear></add> some more<lb/>
to send to some of the old men for<lb/>
their <del>advice</del> inspection. I have been getting<lb/>
some real help as I wrote you in<lb/>
one of those 4 letters mentioned. I hope that<lb/>
was not the missing letter. Briefly, I said<lb/>
that I was wrong about Ames using the<lb/>
tents for the Camp Lazear y. f. cases. He used<lb/>
the 4 shacks then instead of tents. The shacks<lb/>
were originally used by the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Div. Hosp. of<lb/>
the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> A. Corps for Small-pox cases. I had<lb/>
completely forgoten them but remembered them<lb/>
when those quiescent cells in my <unclear>old</unclear> head<lb/>
were tickled up a bit by younger men on<lb/>
men too who actually worked in them-<lb/>
I think I can find out where (in which building<lb/>
18 - 19 - 22 or 23) Lazear died. Of course<lb/>
it might have been in a <unclear>framed</unclear> tent as<lb/>
I first thought. When I get <del>I will let</del><add>a little more</add><lb/>
info. I will redraw the plan of the hospital<lb/>
and send you a copy-</p>
<p>When you <unclear>recieve</unclear> my letter of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I am<lb/>
sure you will cease worrying about the<lb/>
comments you made about my <unclear>mms</unclear>. I<lb/>
enjoyed every one of them, but dont agree<lb/>
with you in all of your views about what<lb/>
happened in Cuba. You will find that you<lb/>
will have to spend more than a year before<lb/>

you will be able to get to the bottom<lb/>
of it all. You have a fine start and<lb/>
have dug up some wonderful information.<lb/>
But there is much to be uncovered I<lb/>
am sure- I know I can help you<lb/>
locate official reports and other sources<lb/>
of info- I have never had time to do it.</p>
<p>I am not quite sure about Pinto's room<lb/>
in our bachelor bldg. In time I will find<lb/>
out. I will explain how Reed happened to have<lb/>
the end room when I answer your long<lb/>
letter. There is no mistake about that point<lb/>
being absolutely correct.</p>
<p>General Brooke died about a month ago.<lb/>
A dissecting <unclear>aneurysm</unclear> which extended down<lb/>
to the <unclear>bifurcation</unclear> and then ruptured into the<lb/>
pericardium. When we get all the &ldquo;dope&rdquo;<lb/>
I will be able to <unclear>have</unclear> the model assembled<lb/>
properly. I think I should supervise that<lb/>
myself by going to <unclear>Carlisle</unclear> and actually<lb/>
seeing it done. I agree that it is<lb/>
important. It should be arranged exactly<lb/>
as it was in 1900. The 1906 status of<lb/>
that hospital is of no interest historically.</p>
<p>There were <add>no</add> buildings between the La Plaza<lb/>
road &amp; the R R track except the disinfecting<lb/>
plant. No buildings on parade ground except<lb/>
bks. at west side. When I get some more<lb/>
copies of the model I can place the barracks where<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06301029"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
they belong. I did not want to cut up this<lb/>
photo. too much on you could not figure out<lb/>
just how I did it. There were very few cuts<lb/>
by the <unclear>scissors</unclear> as you will see-</p>
<p>I am very glad to have you send<lb/>
anything to Gen. Kean. Send him my letters<lb/>
if you like. Anything between Kean and<lb/>
you &amp; me is general property in so far<lb/>
as I am concerned-</p>
<p>As soon as I can work on that massive<lb/>
reply to your big letter I will do so-</p>
<p>The barracks belonged to our medical<lb/>
detatchment. The barracks of the main<lb/>
post consisting of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Cav., 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Infty and<lb/>
2 batteries field Artillery were East of us. <del><unclear>from</unclear></del><lb/>
A quarter of a mile to <add>the nearest and</add> a mile to the Far<lb/>
East End of the long row of buildings.</p>
<p>I still think that our buildings at the<lb/>
hospital ran <add>almost</add> north &amp; South- Of course I<lb/>
<del><unclear></unclear></del><add>can see</add> that a straight line to the gulf-shore<lb/>
line was N. W. From our porch the north<lb/>
star was only a little East of north as I<lb/>
remember it.</p>
<p>Will send this air mail but the photos.<lb/>
will come the regular way (by train)</p>
<p>I get quite a kick out of all<lb/>
this and am glad to find you do<lb/>
also.</p>
