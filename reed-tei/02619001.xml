Don't forget about<lb/>
Locusts on Trees.<lb/>
<dateline>
Monday Evening-<lb/>
</dateline>
<salute>My precious Miss &ldquo;Windy&rdquo;,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whew! how<lb/>
the wind did blow at your hospita-<lb/>
ble ranch on yesterday! As a raiser<lb/>
of ye howling zephrs, you are the<lb/>
greatest success that I know of-<lb/>
Well, as I &ldquo;poneyed&rdquo; along the road,<lb/>
who should come along but D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
&amp; Mrs. Roach &amp; the children- They<lb/>
kindly picked me up &amp; carried me<lb/>
down to the Station -- on the way down<lb/>
the mountain, I had a long chat<lb/>
with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Atkinson -- Miss Pattie's doctor-<lb/>
He seems <add>to be a</add> very pleasant gentleman --<lb/>
and is very fond of the Hopkins peo-<lb/>
ple- I ate my tongue sandwich in<lb/>
Baltimore and got home at 9 o'clock.<lb/>
I found a letter from Col. Scott,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02619002"/>
Gen. Wood's Adjutant General, ex-<lb/>
tending to me an invitation to be<lb/>
present at a dinner to be given<lb/>
to Gen. Wood in Boston, next-<lb/>
Friday night by President Eliott<lb/>
of Harvard &amp; some others- Said<lb/>
that the General was very anxious<lb/>
that I should be present and that<lb/>
the Secretary of War would be<lb/>
present <add>also</add>- I wrote, at once, stating<lb/>
how much I appreciated the Cour-<lb/>
tesy, but that my duties on the Ex-<lb/>
amining Board would prevent my<lb/>
acceptance- Today, I dropped<lb/>
in on the General, at the Everett,<lb/>
to pay my respects, and was much<lb/>
surprised when he told me that<lb/>
he had already accepted an<lb/>
invitation for me, and that the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02619003"/>
Secretary of War was very desi-<lb/>
rous that I should be present-<lb/>
It seems that the dinner <del>w</del> is<lb/>
to be given to Gen. Wood &amp; those<lb/>
members of his staff who were<lb/>
engaged in civil work in Cuba,<lb/>
&amp; as the General says that what<lb/>
I accomplished was <add>of</add>, the most<lb/>
importance of all, I must be<lb/>
there- Under the circumstances<lb/>
I must go -- will get back in<lb/>
time, I hope, to catch the afternoon<lb/>
train for Blue Ridge and spend<lb/>
Sunday amidst the howling tempest<lb/>
again- I hope to obtain some def-<lb/>
inite information about the per-<lb/>
manent S. G. before I get back.<lb/>
Forwood you know, has been<lb/>
appointed- I went <del>in</del> to see him;<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02619004"/>
this afternoon &amp; extended my<lb/>
hearty congratulations- He seemed<lb/>
to be very much gratified over his<lb/>
appointment- Gen. Wood told me that<lb/>
very strong pressure was being brought<lb/>
to have Col. Smart promoted and<lb/>
retired after Forwood's time expired.<lb/>
I had your rocking chairs &amp; Sewing-Ma-<lb/>
chine taken down to the Museum, to-<lb/>
day -- &amp; am having it &amp; the lounge cra-<lb/>
ted by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wild -- Will ship them<lb/>
with other things on Wednesday --<lb/>
ordered your star, this afternoon,<lb/>
will ship whisky tomorrow-<lb/>
Col. Carter has been made a Brig-<lb/>
adier General in the line- D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Roach<lb/>
says locusts are dreadful in his or-<lb/>
chard- Please tell Jacob to go over all<lb/>
of my trees <hi>every</hi> morning &amp; kill all on<lb/>
them- Don't forget this- Love to the<lb/>
girls -- 8 candidates before us --<lb/>
Love &amp; kisses for my precious babies-</p>
