<p>Hench has read Moorman's paper on the yellow fever experiments and agrees that they did not have Congressional support. However, Hench questions Moorman whether it is fair to imply that Congress interfered with the scientists' work when they were never asked to do one thing or another.</p>

<salute>My dear Dr. Moorman:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have read over your paper with great interest and it is<lb/>
a new slant on the <hi>yellow fever</hi> episode. Nevertheless, I think you<lb/>
are right in that they did not have any Congressional support. How-<lb/>
ever, from their standpoint, they didn't need any and I doubt if they<lb/>
asked for it. The yellow fever experiments were set up as a special<lb/>
project by the Surgeon General and Reed. Means were made available<lb/>
by the Army, almost exclusively by the medical department of the Army,<lb/>
and they didn't even want to become very much involved with the other<lb/>
branches of the Army, as their experiments were something in the<lb/>
nature of a secret. When they needed financial help, they went to<lb/>
General Wood. When they needed the help of the local authorities,<lb/>
particularly the Spanish <del>Council</del><add>Consul</add>, they went to him to get his per-<lb/>
mission to carry out experiments on immigrant Spaniards, newly arrived<lb/>
in Cuba.</p>
<p>The only time Congress became involved was leter when<lb/>
suggestions were made to pension the parties concerned, particularly<lb/>
in the cases of the widows of Drs. Reed and Lazear, and you will remember<lb/>
that Congress dilly--dallyed for years.</p>
<p>In summary, you are right in saying that the experiments<lb/>
were done without Congressional control, but is it fair to imply that<lb/>
Congress interfered with their work when they never were asked to do<lb/>
one thing or another?</p>
<p>I shall appreciate it greatly if you would send me a copy of<lb/>
your paper for my files, either before or after it is published. Where<lb/>
were you planning to publish it?</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
