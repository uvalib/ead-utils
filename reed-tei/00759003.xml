<salute>Dear Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I believe Mary answered your letter<lb/>
yesterday - but from what she said I am<lb/>
afraid that you will consider my opinion<lb/>
<add>about the Monday club I mean</add> something like the &ldquo;permission&rdquo; Mrs Crab-<lb/>
tree had to dance the Cake Walk. No My<lb/>
Dear. I see not the slightest reason why you<lb/>
should not talk, &amp; write, of Panama, or Mala-<lb/>
ria, in any way you choose to any <unclear><del>pe</del></unclear>one<lb/>
or set of people you feel like enlighten-<lb/>
ing. Frankly I suspect Field is right a-<lb/>
bout Driver - not &ldquo;Drier&rdquo; - &amp; that he. D. is<lb/>
desireous of exploiting himself, Neverthe-<lb/>
less. the wider Knowledge of Malaria &amp; of<lb/>
Anti-Malarial Measures is diffused - the better<lb/>
it is for the South &amp; S. West. &amp; this is true no<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00759004"/>
C1<lb/>
B20<lb/>
matter <hi>why</hi> the knowledge is diffused. Do you re-<lb/>
member what St. Paul says of the<lb/>
Preaching of Christ of Contention?<lb/>
&ldquo;nevertheless Christ is preached&rdquo;<lb/>
so I feel about the diffusion<lb/>
Feb 11/14<lb/>
<del>Dear Dr. Harlan:<lb/>
I am sending the two patients- White<lb/>
&amp; Henriquez - of whom your chief of staff<lb/>
so kindly said he would see</del><lb/>
of this knowledge &amp; after all I don't <hi>know</hi><lb/>
that D. is mainly trying to exploit himself. It<lb/>
maybe that he has taken the best way to <del>worth</del><lb/>
work, only I doubt it.</p>
<p><del>Nevertheless <unclear>now</unclear>.</del> I see no reason why you sh'd<lb/>
not talk to the Monday Club - none whatever-<lb/>
<unclear><del>D</del></unclear> The newspaper notices are no more than one sees of<lb/>
girls in society events - &amp; as you say are not<lb/>
meant to advertise you but the Anti-Mal. Socie-<lb/>
ty. Frankly I think the teaching it in schools<lb/>
an excellent idea - &amp; the taking of the children- <del><unclear>was</unclear></del><lb/>
of 14 &amp; over out to show them - (a) A. breeding places<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00759005"/>
C1<lb/>
B20<lb/>
3<lb/>
&amp; (b) A. larvae. &amp; (c) the difference between<lb/>
A. &amp; other larvae - Culex in Va. except in <del>big</del><lb/>
seaport towns, - is worth a great deal too- In-<lb/>
deed the demonstration <hi>clinches</hi> the didac-<lb/>
tic lesson. Both our E &amp; I, did that<lb/>
in N. C.. He rather extensively as the<lb/>
schools were in operation when he was<lb/>
there. I showed them to the Roanake Rapid<lb/>
schools &amp; had quite a &ldquo;tag&rdquo; of boys at Eden-<lb/>
ton: Hertford: Fayetteville &amp; Tarboro, although<lb/>
schools were not open then.</p>
<p>Did you notice how I had to correct the <hi>measures</hi><lb/>
of preventing breeding places? The list sent laid-<lb/>
far more stress on breaking up stegomyia breed-<lb/>
ing places than those of A,. I was very gentle with<lb/>
the lessons however &amp; in the main they are correct<lb/>
or correct e--<lb/>

<del>Dear Dr Harlan:<lb/>
I am sending with this the two<lb/>
Patients., White &amp; Henriquez, of whom<lb/>
I spoke to your Chief-of-staff this mor-<lb/>
ning. <add>for such advice</add> Please advise me if White is read-<lb/>
y for operation. &amp; I would be glad if you<lb/>
can give me</del><lb/>
enough &amp; will do good. See if you can get<lb/>
me the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; Bass got up for them<lb/>
- they are <add>rules</add> to prevent malaria. I w'd like to see<lb/>
them. I will not be able to come by<lb/>
Norfolk - at least not to state - on my trip to<lb/>
N. C. I expect to go Monday but have not<lb/>
heard<lb/>
from my request for leave<lb/>
yet. It was made provisionally - on an officer<lb/>
being sent in my place. I am going over to see<lb/>
Helen tomorrow. E. is <hi>not</hi> going with me<lb/>
wishes <hi>not</hi> to go</p>
