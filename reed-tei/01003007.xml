<salute>Dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciate very much your letter of November 1st, en-<lb/>
closing manuscripts regarding impounded waters. I have<lb/>
gone over them hastily, and after studying them a little<lb/>
more will return them to you.</p>
<p>I have practically finished my report on Marion but have<lb/>
not sent it in yet. It is bulky and includes a lot of<lb/>
matter that may be irrelevant, but as I understood Dr.<lb/>
Fricks' instructions, he wanted me to prepare a report<lb/>
about the way I have prepared this one. I did not include<lb/>
any recommendations to be enforced in the pond itself,<lb/>
for the reason that I did not find any breeding of im-<lb/>
portance in the pond. I cannot help but feel that when<lb/>
the pond is full, there will be much production in the<lb/>
shallow water around Yancy's bridge. Just before the pond<lb/>
rises in the spring of the year, say May, it might be<lb/>
advisable to plough all the bottom land so as to get rid<lb/>
of the grass and weeds. The pond is evidently usually<lb/>
full from about June 1st to the middle of August or Sep-<lb/>
tember 1st.</p>
<p>I will be glad to see you at Chattanooga and show you my<lb/>
report and discuss matters with you.</p>
<p>Answering some questions. You asked in a former letter if<lb/>
I met Miss Cora Brittan. I think I did. I think she is<lb/>
in Dr. Jonas' office and told me her home was near Mr.<lb/>
Bost's place. I think she is considerably above the<lb/>
average in intelligence and will probably not miss an<lb/>
opportunity to collect from the Power Company, if one<lb/>
presents itself.</p>
<p>When returning to Columbia I stopped at Charlotte to see<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01003008"/>
-2-<lb/>
Burkholder and Hutchison. The latter told me his father-<lb/>
in-law told him of an outbreak of malaria on John's River<lb/>
below Morganton. He knew no details about it.</p>
<p>I probably did not make myself clear with regard to the<lb/>
seven cases occurring in 1919 more than two miles from the<lb/>
pond. The implication was not that the malaria came from<lb/>
the pond, but it was <del>sighted</del><add>cited</add> by Dr. Long as evidence that<lb/>
malaria <add>not caused by the pond</add> existed in that part of the country. <del>before 1919.</del><lb/>
After talking with the people at Charlotte and learning<lb/>
that the ponds on Linville River and Paddy Creek began to<lb/>
fill sometime in 1917 as the earth dams were being raised,<lb/>
and since local labor may have been employed by the con-<lb/>
tractor of this work, it is even possible that the pond<lb/>
may have been responsible for some of this malaria occur-<lb/>
ing at distances away from the pond.</p>
<p>You asked how far these seven cases were from the men en-<lb/>
gaged in the construction work at the dam and power house.<lb/>
Two cases were at Dysortville, 10 miles south of the pond;<lb/>
four cases on Silver Creek, five miles southeast of the<lb/>
pond; and one on Jamestown Road, three miles from Glen<lb/>
Alpine.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know whether there was an out-<lb/>
break of malaria among the laborers in 1918 and 1919.</p>
<p>I expect to get to Chattanooga about one o'clock on Sunday,<lb/>
November 12th, and expect to be at the Grand Hotel.</p>
<p>With kind regards,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very truly,</salute>
<signed>L. M. Fisher<lb/>
Associate Sanitary Engineer</signed>.
