<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>I fear you think I am a great<lb/>
daudler not to have sent you<lb/>
your photostat MSS before this<lb/>
and you would be entirely right-<lb/>
I waste time terribly, when so little<lb/>
of it is, in all probilily, left for me<lb/>
to waste and on matters that are<lb/>
relatively unimportant- But yes-<lb/>
terday I got together all your<lb/>
MSS and have wrapped them<lb/>
up carefully and they are now<lb/>
waiting for the Express man to<lb/>
come and get them. I feel a little<lb/>
ashamed at following your injunc-<lb/>
tion that they be sent <hi>collect</hi> but<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06310111"/>
2<lb/>
as my bank balance is now down<lb/>
to a bare $5<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> and it is still some<lb/>
days to the end of the month. I<lb/>
must count the pennies not to get<lb/>
into the <hi>red</hi>. Gen. Truby and I<lb/>
have been over all the sheets and<lb/>
after each had read the copy of<lb/>
Lazear's laboratory book, we went<lb/>
over the remarks we had written on<lb/>
the backs together and discussed<lb/>
the few minor points in which<lb/>
we had differed &amp; noted our<lb/>
final agreements. I was especi-<lb/>
ally interested in the record of Dr<lb/>
R. P. Ames alleged case of yellow fever<lb/>
and we entirely agreed that this<lb/>
was certainly an error of diagnosis-<lb/>
It may have been some digestive<lb/>

upset as he was a very heavy<lb/>
eater- Truby remarked &ldquo;Of course<lb/>
you know he had syphilis- I said<lb/>
yes I had heard so. Well said<lb/>
Truby, there is no doubt of it, as<lb/>
he talked of it openly among us<lb/>
doctors, and I have heard him<lb/>
say so myself.&rdquo; This explains why<lb/>
he always sought jobs away from<lb/>
home, and did not live with his<lb/>
quite good looking wife- He did<lb/>
a good job however in the Marianao<lb/>
epidemic and I, for one, should<lb/>
be grateful for his good care of<lb/>
me, in my attack. And I am, altho.<lb/>
when I recall the senseless experiment<lb/>
on the young private Driscoll at Fort<lb/>
M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Intosh Texas in Nov. 1903, when<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06310113"/>
4<lb/>
he put Driscoll's life in jeopardy<lb/>
and undermined his health so that<lb/>
he had to be discharged for disa-<lb/>
bility- When I think of that, as Horace<lb/>
puts it, <hi>surgit aliquid amari</hi> - which<lb/>
leaves a bitter taste in my mouth-</p>
<p>x x x Right here General Truby came<lb/>
in to tell me how he had got his<lb/>
son Jack the West Point Cadetship-<lb/>
He is very happy over it and will<lb/>
go up to New York with him on<lb/>
Tuesday the 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I have a young<lb/>
grandson staying with me, who<lb/>
will go up at the same time-<lb/>
Truby sends his regards and as<lb/>
he went out of the door just now said<lb/>
&ldquo;Be sure to tell Dr. Hench about Jack&rdquo;</p>
<p>With cordial regards</p>
