<p>(ADVANCE FOR AMS OF SUNDAY, NOV. 23)</p>
<p>BY FRANK CAREY</p>
<p>(ADVANCE) WASHINGTON, NOV.22-(AP)-THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN<lb/>
NEW STEPS TO PRESERVE ONE OF THE GREAT &ldquo;BATTLEFIELDS&rdquo; OF MEDICAL<lb/>
HISTORY--THE SITE NEAR HAVANA WHERE WALTER REED CONDUCTED EXPERIMENTS<lb/>
LEADING TO THE CONQUEST OF YELLOW FEVER IN 1900.</p>
<p>THIS WAS LEARNED TODAY ON THE EVE OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE<lb/>
DEATH OF MAJOR REED. HE WAS THE AMERICAN ARMY DOCTOR WHO INSPIRED<lb/>
A VALIANT BAND OF AMERICAN AND SPANISH VOLUNTEERS TO FACE POSSIBLE<lb/>
DEATH TO TEST A CUBAN DOCTOR'S THEORY THAT THE VILLAINOUS AND MYSTERIOUS<lb/>
&ldquo;YELLOW JACK&rdquo; WAS TRANSMITTED BY MOSQUITOES.</p>
<p>SPECIFICALLY, THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT RECENTLY UNDERTOOK ACTIVE<lb/>
MEASURES TO MAKE <unclear></unclear> NATIONAL MONUMENTAL AREA OUT OF OLD &ldquo;CAMP LAZEAR&rdquo;<lb/>
AT QUEMADOS DE MARIANAO JUST OUTSIDE HAVANA. THE PLACE WILL BE<lb/>
FORMALLY MEMORIALIZED AT SPECIAL CEREMONIES TO BE HELD ON DECEMBER 3--<lb/>
THE BIRTHDAY OF THE LATE DR. CARLOS FINLAY, THE CUBAN DOCTOR WHOSE<lb/>
&ldquo;MOSQUITO THEORY&rdquo; WAS PROVED TO BE VALID BY REED'S HISTORIC TESTS.</p>
<p>IT WAS AT CAMP LAZEAR, NAMED FOR AN AMERICAN ARMY DOCTOR WHO DIED<lb/>
OF YELLOW FEVER DURING THE EARLY DAYS OF THE RESEARCH, THAT REED CONDUC-<lb/>
TED HIS CONCLUSIVE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE AID OF THE VOLUNTEERS.</p>
<p>THE TESTS WERE CONDUCTED IN TWO SPECIAL BUILDINGS--ONE OF WHICH<lb/>
STILL STANDS TODAY. IT HAS JUST BEEN REPAIRED FOR THE FIRST TIME<lb/>
AFTER STANDING FOR YEARS &ldquo;<unclear>CREAKING</unclear> WITH AGE AND SLEEPING IN THE<lb/>
CUBAN SUN NEAR A FIELD OF CORN,&rdquo; ACCORDING TO ONE OBSERVER.</p>
<p>IT WAS IN THIS SMALL STRUCTURE THAT A GROUP OF REED'S VOLUNTEERS<lb/>
UNDERWENT A CRUESOME EXPERIENCE WHICH EXPLODED THE THEORY THAT<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER COULD BE CONTRACTED FROM &ldquo;<unclear>FOMITES</unclear>&rdquo;--THE SOILED AND BLOODY<lb/>
BEDDING AND CLOTHING OF FEVER VICTIMS.</p>
<p>IT WAS THERE THAT THEY SLEPT FOR 21 NIGHTS ON FILTHY AND BLOOD-<lb/>
STAINED SHEETS. THEY COVERED THEIR PILLOWS WITH TOWELS SOILED WITH<lb/>
THE BLOOD AND &ldquo;BLACK VOMIT&rdquo; OF FEVER VICTIMS. HEAT FROM A COAL STOVE<lb/>
HEATED THE PORLY VENTILATED PLACE TO TEMPERATURES UP TO 100 DEGREES.<lb/>
THE STENCH, AT TIMES, WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE THE MEN OUT, BUT ALWAYS THEY<lb/>
RETURNED.</p>
<p>DESPITE THIS NARROWING EXPERIENCE, NOT ONE OF THE MEN CONTRACTED<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER--BECAUSE THEIR QUARTERS, FOR ALL THEIR FILTH, WERE<lb/>
CAREFULLY SCREENED AGAINST MOSQUITOES:</p>
<p>THE SECOND BUILDING--IN WHICH SOME MEN WERE PURPOSELY EXPOSED TO<lb/>
THE BITES OF INFECTED MOSQUITOES--HAS LONG SINCE DISAPPEARED, BELIEVED<lb/>
TO HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY A HURRICANE. IT WAS IN THAT BUILDING,<lb/>
WHERE A NUMBER OF THE BITTEN MEN CONTRACTED &ldquo;YELLOW JACK,&rdquo; THAT REED<lb/>
GOT HIS FINAL PROOF THAT THE MOSQUITO WAS THE VILLAIN.</p>
<p>X22WX.</p>
<p>THE STILL-STANDING STRUCTURE-KNOWN AS &ldquo;BUILDING NO. 1&rdquo;--HAS NOW BEEN<lb/>
MADE THE CENTRAL AREA OF A LITTLE PARK.</p>
<p>THE OLD CORNFIELD HAS BEEN CLEARED AND THE LAND <unclear>GRADES</unclear>. A FLAGPOLE<lb/>
<unclear>RISES</unclear> ABOVE THE BUILDING--AND A STONE WALL IS BEING BUILT NEARBY.</p>
<p>ON THE WALL WILL BE PLACED BRONZE MEDALLIONS HONORING REED, FINLAY<lb/>
AND OTHER AMERICAN AND SPANISH DOCTORS WHO TOOK PART IN THE RESEARCH.<lb/>
ON IT, TOO, WILL BE PLACED BRONZE TABLETS CONTAINING THE NAMES OF ALL<lb/>
THE VOLUNTEERS WHO LONG HAVE RANKED AS HEROES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE<lb/>
COUNTRIES.</p>
<p>OLD &ldquo;BUILDING NO. 1&rdquo; WOULD PERHAPS NOT BE STANDING TODAY WERE IT NOT<lb/>
FOR ANOTHER AMERICAN DOCTOR--DR. PHILIP HENCH OF THE MAYO CLINIC, CO-<lb/>
WINNER OF A NOBEL PRIZE FOR HIS RESEARCH ON CORTISONE AND ACTH, THE<lb/>
DRUGS WHICH HAVE SHOWN PROMISE AGAINST ARTHRITIS AND VARIOUS OTHER<lb/>
DISEASES.</p>
<p>HENCH, WHO HAS MADE AN AVOCATION OF THE WALTER REED EPIC, &ldquo;RE-<lb/>
DISCOVERED&rdquo; OLD BUILDING NO. 1 IN 1940--AND, FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, HE<lb/>
HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN THE CAMPAIGN TO HAVE THE OLD STRUCTURE REPAIRED AND<lb/>
PRESERVED.</p>
<p>WITH HENCH AT THE TIME OF THE &ldquo;REDISCOVERY&rdquo; WAS THE LATE JOHN J.<lb/>
MORAN, ONE OF THE ORIGINAL AMERICAN VOLUNTEERS WHO GOT YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
FROM EXPOSURE TO INFECTED MOSQUITOES.</p>
<p>THE VOLUNTEERS WERE TO GET $200 IF THEY CONTRACTED FEVER, $100 IF<lb/>
THEY DIDN'T.</p>
<p>MORAN, WHO NEVER TOOK A CENT FOR HIS PART IN THE TESTS, ONCE<lb/>
TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I FELT IT WAS A CHANCE TO DO SOME GOOD IN THIS LIFE. ALSO, I<lb/>
DIDN'T WANT <unclear>THEN</unclear> WRITING ON MY TOMBSTONE: <unclear>&lsquo;</unclear>HERE LIES JOHN MORAN, WHO<lb/>
DIED FOR $200...<unclear>&rsquo;&rdquo;</unclear></p>
<p>(END ADVANCE FOR AMS OF SUNDAY, NOV 23 - MOVED NOV <unclear>21</unclear>)</p>
