<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your letter of<lb/>
June 19 on <del>Tuesday</del> Monday and also the<lb/>
papers. I am sorry to hear that you<lb/>
are having such hot weather.<lb/>
I see by the papers (Edinburgh) that<lb/>
they are having very hot weather in the<lb/>
West now. I hope you have gone<lb/>
to the mountains and are escaping<lb/>
it. I am very much obliged to you<lb/>
for ordering the &ldquo;Post&rdquo; for me. It has<lb/>
not come yet but I suppose it will<lb/>
by the next mail which reaches me<lb/>
tomorrow.</p>
<p>I have nothing at all to tell about<lb/>
my doings here except that I have<lb/>


been very busy and have had time<lb/>
to see nothing. It has rained<lb/>
off and on principally on. I never<lb/>
saw such a place for rain.</p>
<p>It was clear for a short time<lb/>
on Sunday afternoon and I seized<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00139002"/>
the opportunity to go to Arthur's Seat. I<lb/>
went up by a new way which is<lb/>
shorter but more steep than the<lb/>
other. The view from the top is certainly<lb/>
magnificent, especially on the side<lb/>
away from Edinburgh, on that side<lb/>
the smoke of the town obscures<lb/>
everything.</p>
<p>I was sorry to hear that Judge Ewing<lb/>
had not decided the case. It is remarkable<lb/>
how slow the law is. I can't see that<lb/>
there is any excuse for it. Why<lb/>
should lawyers be allowed to get<lb/>
from one to fifty years behind in their<lb/>
work. The rest of us are expected<lb/>
to be prompt and why shouldn't the<lb/>
same be required of them.</p>
<p>After next Tuesday I shall not be<lb/>
so busy as I am at present<lb/>
as on that day the last of Sir<lb/>
William Turner's examinations takes<lb/>
place. After that time I hope to<lb/>
get to see some of the places<lb/>
around Edinburgh that I have<lb/>
not yet visited. I want to see<lb/>
Roslin, Craigmiller Castle and the<lb/>
Forth Bridge. I also want to take<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00139003"/>
a trip to the lakes. I can make<lb/>
the trip of Loch Katrine, Loch Lomond<lb/>
and the Trosachs all in one<lb/>
day getting back to Edinburgh<lb/>
in the evening. I shall go<lb/>
down to London on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
of July.</p>
<p>I hope you have gone to Bedford or<lb/>
some place in the mountains for the<lb/>
hot spell. You certainly ought to<lb/>
do it. It would build you up<lb/>
wonderfully. You must be sure and<lb/>
not let people bother you.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your affectionate son</salute>
<signed>J. W. L.</signed>
I find that I did not send you an<lb/>
ivy leaf that I got at the ruins<lb/>
of Lennox Castle. I send it now.<lb/>
</closer>
