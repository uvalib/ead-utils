<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Miss Brown and I have put in some very satisfactory work since<lb/>
I last wrote you, on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Miss Brown finished the duplicates of the library cards, which I<lb/>
had had to take from Dr. Frost's files for the History of Yellow Fever, on<lb/>
Monday night, January 7th. She went on sick leave. &ldquo;flu,&rdquo; I fear, on Tues-<lb/>
day morning, January 8th. I've been confined to the house, though not to bed,<lb/>
since January 1st. with a light, though typical, attack of flu. Indeed, Dr.<lb/>
Leake, of the Public Health Service, says that I probably (from my clinical<lb/>
history) developed it on December 29th.--i. e. from my direct exposure to it<lb/>
in Baltimore. This has, however, interfered very little with the work on<lb/>
the book, since, as I wrote you, <del>the</del><add>my</add> work, as planned by Dr. Frost, could<lb/>
be best done at home in the immediate future. This is being done in an<lb/>
&ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo; of &ldquo;Hopkins gargle,&rdquo; Sloan's lini<unclear><del>mmaht</del></unclear><add>ment</add> and sodium salicylate--<lb/>
the last two because the &ldquo;flu&rdquo; has greatly intensified a neuritis I have had<lb/>
in my right arm for the past two months. Fortunately, the &ldquo;mechanics of<lb/>
typewriting&rdquo; hurt it less than writing by hand, so the work on the revision<lb/>
of the bibliographic cards can go on, although not so rapidly as I had<lb/>
hoped. I wish that I could get someone else to work on them also, but the<lb/>
work is too highly specialized for anyone not familiar with our previous<lb/>
work and Miss Brown does not use a typewriter. I hope, and expect, however,<lb/>
to have <add>the</add> remaining bibliographic cards rewritten and rearranged, according to<lb/>
Dr. Frost's plan, by the time he is ready for them, and hope still more that<lb/>
his extra work, on account of the flu, may soon be so arranged as to per-<lb/>
mit of his completing the final editing of Father's Ms. But for the flu,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0326005"/>
flu,<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
his own illness and his subsequent epidemiological work, the MS should<lb/>
have been ready to go to press e'er now. Its a great disappointment, but<lb/>
I trust that things may clear up soon. Also, Frost is well worth waiting<lb/>
for! I think that, during my last stay in Baltimore, Frost did get the<lb/>
first two Sections of Father's MS just as he wanted them for their final<lb/> 
typing. This, thanks to the copy of Villalba, gotten for us by the Library<lb/>
of the Surgeon General of the Army, from which Miss Brown and I had made<lb/>
copious extracts before I went to Baltimore with the verified bibliographic<lb/>
cards for Villalba.</p>
<p>With heartfelt good wishes, and <hi>don't</hi> get the flu under any con-<lb/>
ditions! I'd forgotten, even my after my last year's experience, how<lb/>
many muscles there are to ache!</p>
