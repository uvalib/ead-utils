<salute>My own, Sweet darling;</salute>
</opener>
<p>In con-<lb/>
cluding my last letter, I was<lb/>
forced to do so somewhat<lb/>
abrumptly, as the sound<lb/>
of the drum told me that the<lb/>
Steamer, with its disting-<lb/>
uished guests, was ap-<lb/>
proaching. Buckling on<lb/>
my sword, with all celer-<lb/>
ity, I rushed down to the<lb/>
wharf, in company with<lb/>
General Abbott &amp; his other<lb/>

Staff officers. A moment<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01721002"/>
after the Battallion, coming<lb/>
at a double quick, had reached<lb/>
the wharf &amp; was drawn up<lb/>
<del>with</del> in double file- By this<lb/>
time, the steamer, handsomely<lb/>
decorated with flags, had<lb/>
approached the dock &amp; soon<lb/>
she was made fast- As<lb/>
the Secretary of War &amp; Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi><lb/>
Sherman stepped off the boat,<lb/>
the cannon which had been<lb/>
charged, broke forth in<lb/>
one tremendous volley, &amp;<lb/>
immediately the Band began<lb/>
to pour forth &ldquo;Hail to the<lb/>
Chief-&rdquo; Being one of the Staff<lb/>
Officers, I was, at once, in<lb/>
troduced to the Secretary &amp;<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01721003"/>
Gen. Sherman &amp; had the pleasure<lb/>
of grasping their hands- Besides<lb/>
these, there were many distin-<lb/>
guished military officers in<lb/>
Company with the Secretary,<lb/>
Major General Hancock, among<lb/>
the rest- We soon march <del>by</del><lb/>
past the Battallion, which<lb/>
had come to &ldquo;present arms,<lb/>
&amp; in the midst of descending<lb/>
floods, we marched to the Tor-<lb/>
pedo Building. General<lb/>
Sherman excused the Batt<hi rend="superscript">l</hi><lb/>
from the Review, which<lb/>
was to have taken place, on<lb/>
account of the pouring<lb/>
rain which came down<lb/>
in torrents- So it was,<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01721004"/>
we all got thoroughly wet,<lb/>
for we had to escort the par-<lb/>
ty around through the Fort.<lb/>
After this, the Secretary wit-<lb/>
nessed the explosion of a tor-<lb/>
pedo out in the Sound &amp;<lb/>
then, embarking on Board<lb/>
the Steamer, took course for<lb/>
New York- I was very much<lb/>
pleased with General Sher-<lb/>
man, chiefly because he seem-<lb/>
ed so modest &amp; unassuming,<lb/>
for one occupying so high<lb/>
a position- General Hancock<lb/>
complimented me by telling<lb/>
me that I looked like a soldier,<lb/>
but added that I was a<lb/>
very <hi>young</hi> looking doctor!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01721005"/>
And now a word on one<lb/>
or two matters mentioned in<lb/>
your last letter. Really, it strikes<lb/>
me, my darling Emilie, that you<lb/>
are very liberal to be giving<lb/>
me away so readily to another<lb/>
young lady, especially one whom<lb/>
I have never seen, &amp; hence<lb/>
don't know whether I should<lb/>
<add>be</add> pleased with her- Perhaps<lb/>
this was the reason of your<lb/>
great generosity, wasn't it?<lb/>
Now had it been &ldquo;Miss Vie,&rdquo;<lb/>
instead of Miss Mollie, I could<lb/>
<del>have</del> only <add>have</add> politely bowed<lb/>
my thanks &amp; acquiescence.<lb/>
It would sound so pretty<lb/>
to say, &ldquo;oh! <hi>my</hi>, sweet little<lb/>
<hi>Vie</hi>&rdquo;! The poetic effect, you observe.<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01721006"/>
I have yet another objec-<lb/>
tion to your liberality. It<lb/>
is that I am not yet tired<lb/>
of belonging to my <hi>precious</hi><lb/>
little Emilie, &amp; I <hi>don't want<lb/>
to be given away to any-<lb/>
body else in this world</hi>!<lb/>
And I <hi>won't</hi> be given away<lb/>
neither! And if old Mr July<lb/>
or August, or whatever his name<lb/>
is, don't stop sending <del>sen-<lb/>
ding</del> messages to my<lb/>
little sweet-heart, I'll make<lb/>
it a good deal <hi>warmer</hi> for<lb/>
him than his name would<lb/>
imply! You can tell him<lb/>
so, too! In reply to the<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01721007"/>
the remark that I had neglected to invite<lb/>
you to the Theatrical Performance, I as-<lb/>
sure you, darling, that I was going to send<lb/>
you an invitation before the performance<lb/>
came off. I find, however, that I will not<lb/>
take part, owing to the fact that I will <add>not</add> remain<lb/>
here long enough to contribute my services-<lb/>
Dr Heger received a letter from the Surgeon Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi><lb/>
on Monday, stating that I would soon be relieved<lb/>
from duty, at this post, &amp; I am, daily, expecting my<lb/>
orders to arrive- Don't stop your letters, as I will not leave<lb/>
for a week after my orders arrive.</p>
