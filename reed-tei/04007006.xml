<salute>Dear Phil,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Ive been in Washington<lb/>
two days and have seen<lb/>
General Hillman who was very<lb/>
kind but said he couldn't do<lb/>
anything for me. I was glad to<lb/>
be able to tell him the story<lb/>
of The Army Doctor, myself, however.<lb/>
Then saw Gardner who was<lb/>
no longer angry and yet<lb/>
stuck to his guns on many<lb/>
points. He would like to<lb/>
have the magazine sort of<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04007007"/>
an inspirational Sunday<lb/>
School book with emphasis<lb/>
on the heroism of Army Doctors<lb/>
and the &ldquo;to ye who are about<lb/>
to die&rdquo; angle - which only a<lb/>
sentimental middle aged gentlemen<lb/>
not well acquainted with <add>the</add> flesh<lb/>
and blood doctors who are<lb/>
going into service, would suggest.<lb/>
I asked him to recommend<lb/>
four good retired M. C.<lb/>
officers, <add>one of</add> whom might act as a<lb/>
paid - (and well paid) advisor<lb/>
to our editor. Low and <unclear>behold</unclear> the<lb/>
one he recommended <unclear>hiphest</unclear><lb/>
was your friend Col. Siler. I have<lb/>
an appointment with him at his<lb/>
home tonight. Col. Siler is now<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f04007008"/>
THE<lb/>
Carlton<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
President of the Gorgas Institute<lb/>
so Im not so optimistic about<lb/>
his accepting the job-- but I'll<lb/>
try to get him as I believe<lb/>
he'll help me moderate Gardner's<lb/>
views. Of. course I don't want<lb/>
a Whizz Bang - which is about<lb/>
what the August issue was-<lb/>
and I'm ashamed of it- But<lb/>
how popular it was with the<lb/>
<unclear>medicos</unclear> may be shown by<lb/>
the fact that of 70,000<lb/>
copies sent <add>to civilian physicians for the first time,</add> with reply cards<lb/>
asking to be placed on the<lb/>
permanent mailing list-- we<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f04007009"/>
THE<lb/>
Carlton<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
have already received 14,500<lb/>
replies and it will run to<lb/>
20,000 in the next ten days.</p>
<p>Murphy, our new editor<lb/>
was ill advised on the August<lb/>
issue, by a Jewish (smart)<lb/>
Major in the M. C. at Camp Dix<lb/>
who has taken a great interest<lb/>
in the magazine. He's a prominent<lb/>
neuropsychiatrist - but you<lb/>
know how they are, - I'm eager<lb/>
to talk to Siler.</p>
<p>Robin is with me - and we<lb/>
spent an hour with the Keanes<lb/>
yesterday afternoon who asked<lb/>
all about you. I'll send you some<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f04007010"/>
pictures next week</p>
<p>I promised Gardner a<lb/>
framed &ldquo;Conquerors of Yellow Fever&rdquo;<lb/>
picture for his home which he<lb/>
was anxious to get. He thinks<lb/>
it one of the finest paintings<lb/>
in the world - which helped me<lb/>
a lot. For a man who professes<lb/>
such impeceable delicacy in the<lb/>
realms of sex etc - he is the<lb/>
most profane individual I've<lb/>
met in a long time. If Col.<lb/>
Siler comes with us I'll get<lb/>
him to ask Gardner for an<lb/>
article. I'm still only an advertiser<lb/>
in the magazine but as I control<lb/>
all the advertising they have- I<lb/>
control the book in the last<lb/>
analysis. We've had 123 letters<lb/>
from overseas to date. That shows<lb/>
the book is reaching the M. C. in<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f04007011"/>
THE<lb/>
Carlton<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
our foreign bases -- and<lb/>
that the first class mail idea<lb/>
which is absolutely original for<lb/>
a magazine - is really working.<lb/>
Of course it goes first class<lb/>
(6<hi rend="superscript">&cent;</hi>) only to Physicians in the<lb/>
Army and Navy.</p>
<p>I hope you reached<lb/>
Colorado without punctures<lb/>
and that you find the new<lb/>
station a good one.</p>
<p>Gen'l Hillman sent his regards.<lb/>
He thinks you're going to be<lb/>
tops in the Army and I agree.</p>
