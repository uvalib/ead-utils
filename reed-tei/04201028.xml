<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It just occurred to me that the Claypool Hotel might have been the<lb/>
one in which Doctor Reed stayed.</p>
<p>I came to Indianapolis in 1912 and sure the Claypool hotel was over 12<lb/>
years old at that time, in fact as I recall, it looked like it might have been<lb/>
20 or 25 years old then.</p>
<p>Now, I think it would be a good idea for you to write to an Indiana-<lb/>
polis newspaper man, of my acquaintance, tell him what you are up to and elicit<lb/>
his cooperation on the basis that one of these days a 50th anniversary of<lb/>
Doctor Reed's historic Indianapolis announcement will come along, and that some<lb/>
Indianapolis paper should have all of the facts that you are now assembling.</p>
<p>The truth is, Phil, that this material would be a fine full-page<lb/>
spread for their Indianapolis Sunday Star.</p>
<p>I am thinking that the Star could put a reporter looking into this<lb/>
to determine exactly when the Claypool was built, whether Doctor Reed stayed<lb/>
there, etc. etc.</p>
<p>If it turns out that he did stay there at the Claypool, then it is<lb/>
possible that we could find the old register. And I believe that if the<lb/>
Star went after it hard enough, they could find some old medical man who<lb/>
will recall where Doctor Reed stayed, even if the register is not in existence.</p>
<p>In writing to my newspaper friend, I would emphasize the point that<lb/>
the Indianapolis papers of April 1900 entirely missed the significance of this<lb/>
historic event; I would also tell my newspaper friend about the plans of the<lb/>
Republic of Cuba to set up a national memorial to Doctor Reed and emphasize<lb/>
that Doctor Reed came directly from Cuba to Indianapolis to make his historic<lb/>
announcement.</p>
<p>The man to whom I would suggest you write is Mr. James A. Stuart,<lb/>
Managing Editor, Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana. You might say<lb/>
to Mr. Stuart that you are writing to him at the suggestion of a mutual friend,<lb/>
namely me.</p>
<p>I came to Indianapolis in 1912 to work my way through Butler College<lb/>
as a full time reporter on the Indianapolis Star, of which this same James A.<lb/>
Stuart was then the city editor. He was almost like a father to me in those<lb/>
days, counselling and guiding me in both my newspaper and college work.</p>
<p><unclear>We</unclear> will do anything we can to dig up particular things you might want<lb/>
but we don't have any where near the facilities that the Star may have. They<lb/>
can command and get anything they want. And, of course, please let me know<lb/>
whatever develops, as both Ray Sweeney and I will be intensely interested.</p>
