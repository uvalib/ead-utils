FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY<lb/>
A.<lb/>
<dateline>
WAR DEPARTMENT,<lb/>
OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL,<lb/>
WASHINGTON.<lb/>
<date value="1905-03-25">March 25, 1905.</date>

Dr. Howard A. Kelly,<lb/>
1418 Eutaw Place,<lb/>
Baltimore, Maryland.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Kelly:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Major Borden tells me that he has sent you a copy of the medical<lb/>
history of Dr. Reed's illness, so I presume your object in writing to me was<lb/>
simply to get my personal recollections of his sickness and death.</p>
<p>On November twelfth he was taken with intestinal pain and discom-<lb/>
fort, but considered it acute indigestion. He told me he had had at various times<lb/>
in the past year or two, very similar attacks which always passed off in a day or<lb/>
two with careful dieting and the administration of a cathartic.</p>
<p>He did not go to bed, but as he was no better the next day I urged<lb/>
him to consult Borden, which he did, I think, on the fourteenth. Dr. Borden diag-<lb/>
nosed probable appendiceal inflammation, but as there were no severe symptoms a<lb/>
prompt operation was not deemed necessary.</p>
<p>On the evening of the fifteenth I was invited to dine with Dr. Reed,<lb/>
to meet Dr. Gorgas, of the Army, now Chief of the Sanitary Department of the Pana-<lb/>
ma Canal, but found Reed in bed and unable to come to the table.</p>
<p>On the sixteenth his pulse was normal and his temperature not over<lb/>
99.5 at any time during the day. He passed an uncomfortable night, however, and<lb/>
Dr. Borden determined next day to operate in spite of the mildness of the symptoms.<lb/>
Major Borden has informed you of the condition found, which was graver than could<lb/>
possibly have been guessed from any of the symptoms observed prior to the operation,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06204002"/>
Dr.H.A.Kelly -- #2.<lb/>
FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY<lb/>
and from the discolored and board-like rigidity of the caput coli, Dr. Borden pre-<lb/>
dicted probable sloughing and a fecal fistula. His prediction was found to have<lb/>
come true when the first packing was removed. No serious symptoms developed dur-<lb/>
ing the first three days after the operation, although his pulse was rapid and he<lb/>
seemed nervous and depressed.</p>
<p>I visited him daily at Major Borden's hospital, where he had been<lb/>
taken <del>after</del><add>for</add> the operation and saw him every day except on the twentieth, when he<lb/>
was asleep at the time I called. On the two preceding days he talked about his<lb/>
condition and his anxiety for his family on account of the inadequacy of the pro-<lb/>
vision he would leave for their support. I tried to make him take a more cheerful<lb/>
view of the prospect of his recovery and told him what I had learned in confidence;<lb/>
that the Secretary of War had put in his Annual Report, which had not yet been<lb/>
given out, a recommendation that he be promoted to the grade of Colonel. He frowned<lb/>
and said, &ldquo;I care nothing for that now.&rdquo; It was the reply of Launcelot of the<lb/>
Lake, &ldquo;Prize me no prizes for my prize is death.&rdquo; My last interview with him was<lb/>
on the night of the twenty-second, a few hours before his death, when I took his<lb/>
daughter, to whom he was tenderly attached, to see her last of him. His extremi-<lb/>
ties were at that time cold and he was somewhat flighty, but know us both and talked<lb/>
rationally. When the young girl broke down and had to leave the room to regain her<lb/>
composure, Reed was evidently much affected and calling me said, &ldquo;Take her home<lb/>
Kean, I would rather she should not see me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Reed was buried with military honors on Tuesday, November 25th,<lb/>
from St. Thomas Church. The pallbearers were all officers of the Medical Corps of<lb/>
the Army, being Colonel Calvin De Witt, Majors Louis A. La Grade, W. B. Davis, W.<lb/>
D. McCaw, J. R. Kean and W. B. Banister. Although it rained continuously there<lb/>
was a large attendance, including the student officers and professors of the Army<lb/>

Dr.H.A.Kelly -- #3.<lb/>
FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY<lb/>
Medical School and the Navy Medical School in uniform, a number of general officers<lb/>
with their staffs, the professors and many students of the Columbian University,<lb/>
Professors Welch, Osler, Flexner, and other distinguished scientific men from a<lb/>
distance, and a large concourse of friends.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed was buried at Arlington, on a beautiful knoll overlooking<lb/>
the Potomac and the city of Washington.</p>
<p>I have not by me a copy of the inscription on the simple but hand-<lb/>
some monument which his widow has erected over him, but will write to Mrs. Reed to<lb/>
send it to you if you desire it, together with a description of the monument. I<lb/>
will also ask Mrs. Reed to send you a copy of the photograph of the bust which she<lb/>
has. If for any reason she is not able to do so, I will proceed at once to have<lb/>
the bust photographed again for you. I am somewhat reluctant to have this done if<lb/>
not necessary, because it would probably involve the taking of the bust down from<lb/>
its position in the Museum, with the consequent danger that some accident might<lb/>
happen to it.</p>
<p>Trusting that this account may be satisfactory to you, and that you<lb/>
will put it into more suitable words, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>J. R. Kean</signed>.
