Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
MAYO CLINIC,<lb/>
Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am sending you herewith a revised copy of the question-<lb/>
naire you had prepared for me and the answers to which were dictated to<lb/>
Mrs. Phillips. I have made no change of an essential nature in your<lb/>
questions and such changes as I have made in them are purely aimed at<lb/>
interpreting what you had in mind when you formulated them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have enlarged upon or clarified my<lb/>
own answers so that the uninitiated can make sense out of them and dove-<lb/>
tail my statements with names, places and dates. All my life, I have<lb/>
been a &ldquo;crank&rdquo; on details. My &ldquo;Sick &amp; Wounded&rdquo; reports, while in the<lb/>
Hospital Corps of the Army here, were considered models in that diagnosis,<lb/>
a matter of prime importance for the office of the Surgeon General of<lb/>
the Army, had to be complete to the minutest detail and written, in long<lb/>
hand, within a very limited space. If it concerned an &ldquo;incised wound&rdquo; on<lb/>
the index or other finger of the left or right hand, the exact location<lb/>
had to be anatomically stated and a disease had to be described as acute<lb/>
or chronic, etc., etc. The doctors responsible for diagnosis considered<lb/>
me more or less of a nuisance because of my insistence that diagnosis<lb/>
should be complete. There was method in my madness. If the &ldquo;Sick &amp;<lb/>
Wounded Report&rdquo; got by the Chief Surgeon's Office, showing an incomplete<lb/>
diagnosis, it was sure to be discovered in the Surgeon General's Office<lb/>
and request made for its completion, to the Post of origin, through<lb/>
regular military channels. Those prepared by me were considered models<lb/>
for neatness, legibility and completeness by the Chief Surgeon of my<lb/>
Department. Now, I will proceed.</p>
<p>Certain incidents in the life of every one of us <hi>stick out<lb/>
like a sore thumb</hi>, as do important dates. They remain engraved in our<lb/>
memories. I do not claim infallibility in connection with certain months<lb/>
mentioned in this questionnaire but those of paramount importance are<lb/>
still fresh in my memory. What happened is still fresh in my memory.<lb/>
For instance, I have mentioned 4:30 P. M. as the hour when I was accosted<lb/>
by Dr. Ames while on my way to my room within the Post Hospital grounds,<lb/>
after finishing my day's work at General Lee's Headquarters, while the<lb/>
hour may have been 5:30 just as well. Kissinger and I may have arrived<lb/>
at the &ldquo;momentous decision&rdquo; at 1, 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. The<lb/>
exact hour had no special meaning for me as I had made my own decision<lb/>
before I discussed it with him. I think you can see what I am driving at.<lb/>
I hope so, at least.</p>
<p>It has been no small task to write out the six pages enclosed<lb/>
with two index fingers, as you can well imagine and I do hope that you will<lb/>
not feel dissatisfied with the revised product. Will get all the other<lb/>
pending items assembled as soon as possible and forward same to you with<lb/>
least possible delay. With very kindest regards to Mrs. Hench and your<lb/>
good self, <del><unclear>from</unclear></del> in which Elida joins me, I remain,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your friend always,</salute>
<signed>John J. Moran</signed>
