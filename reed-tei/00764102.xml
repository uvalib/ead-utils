<opener>
<dateline>
1895 Thorburn Avenue<lb/>
Portland - Oregon-<lb/>
</dateline>
Dr. Henry R. Carter-<lb/>
<salute>Kind Sir-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I believe God <hi>is</hi> &ldquo;good<lb/>
to us both-&rdquo; Evidently he has given<lb/>
you a daughter - who realizes her<lb/>
blessing in having a father-like<lb/>
you - to care for while I have a son<lb/>
who quite shamelessly spoils<lb/>
his silly old mother-</p>
<p>I could never tell you my surprise<lb/>
when I read your letter- I had been<lb/>
wondering if you were yet alive in<lb/>
<unclear>Porto</unclear> Rico - never dreaming you could<lb/>
have returned home - or that you<lb/>
would trouble to write-</p>
<p>It seems that I owed you more<lb/>
than I knew- It was you who<lb/>
made Sra. Paquita -- the proprie-<lb/>
tress of the Hotel Yumari - <unclear>relent</unclear>-<lb/>
when she tried to charge me $500<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00764103"/>
for the 5 days Mr Wilder was ill- Not Sra.<lb/>
Yametti - <hi>she</hi> was Nueva Cubana- I wrote to<lb/>
her for several years and her daughter spent<lb/>
a Summer with us in the East when the<lb/>
Worcester girls did themselves proved in<lb/>
entertaining her- She said she didn't know<lb/>
girls could have such good times- But Sra.<lb/>
Paquita -- I remember standing on the<lb/>
opposite side of the court - with the New<lb/>
England doctor who was your assistant-<lb/>
when she gave me the bill and poured<lb/>
out a steady stream of Spanish <unclear>invectins</unclear><lb/>
all the time you and the Cuban doctors<lb/>
were <unclear>embalming</unclear> Mr. Wilder's body- I often<lb/>
wondered what softened her heart- I<lb/>
did not know of the attachment and I<lb/>
realize now that you probably saved me<lb/>
from a very unpleasant experience - and<lb/>
I thank you sincerely- So &ldquo;Gorgas did<lb/>
most of it-&rdquo; It maybe that unselfish kindness<lb/>
is an integral part of his character too-<lb/>
You speak of Panama and Russia- I<lb/>
always thought of you as somewhere in<lb/>
the thick of the fight in Panama - and<lb/>
I believe - I saw your name mentioned<lb/>
in connection with the Russian party -<lb/>
yet- regardless of press notices is the fact<lb/>
that the worker who keeps the light burn-<lb/>
ing is quite as necessary for the true<lb/>
enlightenment of the world as is the<lb/>
lamp or its reflector-</p>
<p>You certainly have had a &ldquo;<unclear>strenous</unclear>&rdquo;<lb/>
life-</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00764104"/>
<p>They say this higher steeps are gen-<lb/>
erally rocky- Still it must be pleas-<lb/>
ant to stand where the far-reaching<lb/>
results of one's efforts can be seen-<lb/>
You honor my note too much - but<lb/>
I shall keep your letter as I have<lb/>
your card and that of Dr Finley - through<lb/>
all these years - and when I begin to lose<lb/>
faith in humanity- I shall read -<lb/>
and remember there still are<lb/>
men who realize that the individ-<lb/>
ual consciousness of having<lb/>
done one's duty is the greatest<lb/>
earthly reward.</p>
<p>May the New Year bring you<lb/>
health -- and happiness both<lb/>
to you and yours-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours</salute>
