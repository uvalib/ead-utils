<p>The &ldquo;August storm&rdquo; is on us &amp; is<lb/>
not so far a bad one, this is the end of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> day.<lb/>
I put 4 oars in the whale-boat &amp; went out this<lb/>
morning to the Brandon - she has had 12 men out<lb/>
of 18 in <unclear>am</unclear> - sick since Sunday - but it was a<lb/>
rough pull. Coming back we rode one breaker<lb/>
I think 400 yards &amp; in about 2 1/2 minutes. Two<lb/>
of the men fell off the seats &amp; it was all I could<lb/>
do to hold the tiller bearing my breast a-<lb/>
gainst it &amp; pushing with both hands.<lb/>
The Brandon men have cholera-Morbis with ex-<lb/>
treme depression - due I find now to rotten<lb/>
grain in her timbers. I have one of the ap-<lb/>
prentices - 16 years old - a nice little fellow<lb/>
ashore now &amp; I almost wish Katie were here to<lb/>
entertain him. He has such a nice uniform &amp; cap,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00720002"/>
I spent my birthday out on the ships, not doing a<lb/>
great deal, but it was calm &amp; the distances are<lb/>
considerable so much time is taken in going<lb/>
from one to the other.</p>
<p>I am entirely passed any risk from the<lb/>
Castilla &amp; I think there is none now from the Brandon<lb/>
Had quite a dysentery yesterday - from the Brandon's grain<lb/>
I think - but am all well now - All of her cares too were slight,<lb/>
Had the vessel become infected with Yellow Fever It had been im-<lb/>
possible to clean her save by a northern winter.</p>
<p>As to my old Yankee Italian who thought his vessel heal-<lb/>
thy when she had had 6 cases of fever out of a possible 7<lb/>
I have not begun on him; but apprehend no trouble, as I feel<lb/>
pretty sure the other man is insusceptible to contagion<lb/>
&amp; I have done a precautionary fumigation on her.<lb/>
I am going to try to use the steam chamber I have on the<lb/>
flat this week, with what result I cannot yet say.<lb/>
There is but little to tell this time mother only<lb/>
things are going fairly smoothly &amp; satisfactorily &amp; I have only<lb/>
one &amp; a half vessels here to disinfect &amp; two <add>&amp; 1/2</add> others lay-<lb/>
ing quarantine-</p>
<p>I see by L's letter Ed is all right again. Well the summer<lb/>
is passing, although it has been slow, &amp; in 5 weeks but little trou-<lb/>
blesome quarantine will be left. I have certainly had a hard<lb/>
<hi>2</hi> months (not quite) of it &amp; it seems like <hi>4</hi> months.</p>
<p>Love to all</p>

Aug 28:<lb/>
Storm over &amp; no damage done. My boy is well a-<lb/>
gain a nice little fellow. <unclear>Bannerman</unclear> by name,<lb/>
wanted a sheet of paper to write to his mother by this mail<lb/>
(as I am doing) said he wanted to see her dreadfully<lb/>
when he thought he was going to die aboard ship.<lb/>
Have had a pretty full day - tomorrow I think<lb/>
will not be - &amp; all a little tired but well, &amp;<lb/>
every thing going on satisfactorily<lb/>
