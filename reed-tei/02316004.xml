<p>YELLOW FEVER AND MOSQUITOES.</p>
<p>After years of research the theory that the mosquito is largely<lb/>
if not exclusively responsible for the dissemination of malaria has been<lb/>
fairly well established. There is now reason for suspecting that the same<lb/>
insect is an active agent in spreading yellow fever also. &ldquo;The Philadelphi<add>a</add><lb/>
Medical Journal&rdquo; prints a paper by Dr. Walter Reed a surgeon of the United<lb/>
States Army, who with three assistant surgeons, was sent by the War Depart-<lb/>
ment to Cuba last summer for the purpose of studing this peculiarly<lb/>
American tropical disease. The Commission undertook two tasks. One was to<lb/>
find, if possible, the microbe which Sanarelli declares is characteristic<lb/>
of yellow fever. And it is a remarkable fact that although specimens of<lb/>
blood were taken from eighteen patients, at least eleven of whom were<lb/>
seriously sick, and fortyeight cultures made therewith, absolutely no<lb/>
bacilli icteroides were discovered. Similar tests were made with infected<lb/>
parts of the dead bodies of nearly a dozen victims of yellow fever without<lb/>
verifying Saranelli's alleged discovery in a single instance. The other<lb/>
subject of inquiry by the Commission was the possibilitty of communicating<lb/>
this malady by the bite of a mosquito.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed credits and Havana phisician Dr. Finlay with the theory<lb/>
that the desease could be spread in this manner, although the Cuban's own<lb/>
experiments do not appear to have been conclusive. From eggs of the<lb/>
particular species of mosquito that Dr. Finley had suspected -subsequently<lb/>
identified by Dr. Howard at Washington as the Culex fasciatus- Dr. Reed<lb/>
hatched out the insects with which he made his tests. The mosquitoes were<lb/>
permitted to bite yellow fever patients at different stages of the<lb/>

-2-.<lb/>
desease.and then to bite persons who were believed to be non-immune.<lb/>
In nine of eleven cases no result followed. But well defined yellow<lb/>
feverensued in two. Dr. Carroll, one of the assistant surgeons associated<lb/>
with Dr. Reed and a person whose name is withheld developed unmistakable<lb/>
symptoms, but recovered. Another member of the Commission Dr. Lazear,<lb/>
was accidentally bitten twicw, and not only was he attacked with yellow<lb/>
fever, but the attack proved fatal. There is some uncertainty about the<lb/>
species of mosquito that bit Dr. Lazear.</p>
<p>This interesting and important announcement is put in what<lb/>
Dr. Reed calls a &ldquo;preliminary note&rdquo;. The report does not profess to<lb/>
cover the subject completely. Indeed, it does not prove very much. Two<lb/>
of the three persons who developed yellow fever after having been bitten<lb/>
had participated in autopsies of fever cases at a hospital and were<lb/>
otherwise exposed to risk. The possibility of other means of infection<lb/>
that the mosquito was not therefore, altogether excluded. For these and<lb/>
other reasons it is in the highest degree desirable that the investigatio<add>n</add><lb/>
be pushed further another year, when, if volunteers can fe found, such<lb/>
tests should be made as will settle several questions beyond doubt.</p>
<p>In the first place, the subjects experimented upon should be<lb/>
placed beyond the chance of infection from any source but the mosquito.<lb/>
The conditions of the experiment in the Roman Campagna by Dr. Sambon<lb/>
and Low this last summer should be observed. What the medical profession<lb/>
wants to know above all other things in this matter is whether the<lb/>
mosquito is the only agent involved in the propagation of yellow fever<lb/>
or one of several and perhaps the last significant of them all. Again<lb/>
the insects should be dissected and examined under the microscope to<lb/>
discover whether they carry the poison on the outside of the proboscis<lb/>
and toes, as common flies transport the germs of typhoid or inside<lb/>
the stomach and intestines, like the malaria bearing mosquito.</p>

<p>Finally, it should be ascertaine how many spicies of mosquito are<lb/>
concerned in the business. At present the responsibility for the<lb/>
dissemination of malaria rests on the anopheles alone. Can the distri-<lb/>
bution of yellow fever poison be similarly limited to the Culex<lb/>
fasciatus? And how abundant is that species relatively to other in Cuba ?.</p>
