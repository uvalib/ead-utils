Avenida Menocal 455-457<lb/>
Havana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>Dear Mr. Moran:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You may have read something in the Havana papers about the series of<lb/>
paintings which is now being done by Mr. Dean Cornwell for my firm, John<lb/>
Wyeth &amp; Brother Inc. of Philadelphia. It just happens that Mr. Cornwell<lb/>
and I were in Havana during the time that you were in Pennsylvania<lb/>
attending the dedication of the Lazear Memorial Hall at Washington and<lb/>
Jefferson University. While in Cuba for two weeks, Mr. Cornwell and<lb/>
I attempted to get as much of the story on what happened during the in-<lb/>
vestigation of yellow fever back in 1900 as was possible from the Cubans,<lb/>
but fortunately, Dr. P.F. Hench of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
wrote us a few weeks ago and since that time we have had several conver-<lb/>
sations and considerable correspondence with him.</p>
<p>Yesterday I placed copies of the first two paintings in the series<lb/>
&ldquo;Pioneers of American Medicine&rdquo; in the mail for you and they will arrive<lb/>
under separate cover at about the time this letter should be received.<lb/>
I did this merely to let you know more about the project. Dr. Hench<lb/>
has suggested that you may have additional information which will be of<lb/>
value to us in getting ready for this painting. At the moment I have no<lb/>
particular questions to ask you other than this: Have you a photograph<lb/>
of yourself taken anywhere near the year 1900? We plan to put both you<lb/>
and Mr. Kissinger in the painting along with the Reed Yellow Fever<lb/>
Board and others who took an active part in the experiment. If you<lb/>
have such a photograph, even though it may have been taken two or<lb/>
three years earlier or up to ten years later it would be of considerable<lb/>
value. We have a number of contemporary photographs of yourself but<lb/>
one taken at an early age would be helpful. You may be assured that<lb/>
it would be returned to you promptly and in good condition, as we would<lb/>
only wish to have a photographic copy made.</p>
