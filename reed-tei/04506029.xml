General Albert Truby<lb/>
General Albert Love<lb/>
Colonel J. F. Siler<lb/>
<salute>Dear Friends:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have received the enclosed letter from Dr. Pedro Nogueira. I have sent my<lb/>
general approval. Unfortunately my reply was delayed because of several out-<lb/>
of-town meetings. It would hardly seem proper for me to make any belated changes.<lb/>
As you know, in July I sent him a series of documented reports and very specific<lb/>
suggestions. Now that they have gone over them, it hardly seems proper for me<lb/>
to do more than give him my general approval. On the other hand, it may not be<lb/>
too late, if you have a real objection to any of his decisions, for you to cable<lb/>
him.</p>
<p>I am sorry that Dean and perhaps Doctor Pinto will not be mentioned. Certainly<lb/>
Dean might be mentioned, but they seem to be confining the names to those who<lb/>
actually served at Camp Lazear and if so, Dean gets left out. I am of course<lb/>
delighted that they are honoring Generals Kean and Truby and Sternberg and<lb/>
Doctor Ames. It is also, I suppose, fitting that Lambert who nursed most of<lb/>
the men so assiduously, should also be honored. He was certainly the main<lb/>
male nurse.</p>
<p>To what extent Miss Warner deserves this honor, I am not certain. I think she<lb/>
was the woman nurse who nursed Lazear and perhaps three or four of the earlier<lb/>
cases, but I am a little prejudiced against her because I have read an article<lb/>
or two that she wrote which contained many inaccuracies. I do not know enough<lb/>
however to object. If General Truby does, I shall have to leave that to him.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M.D.</signed>
PSH:alc<lb/>
<seg>
P.S.: General Truby: I fly to New York today and then to Boston but will be<lb/>
back Friday morning. Look what greeted me in the morning Minneapolis paper. Who<lb/>
in the world is John Peter Barstad? I never heard of him. Can you tell me who<lb/>
he was? I didn't realize that Minneapolis had its own &ldquo;pretender.&rdquo; Incidentally,<lb/>
the number of old Spanish American War veterans who &ldquo;remember&rdquo; all about their<lb/>
contribution to Walter Reed is large enough to fill a regiment.<lb/>
I know the medical editor of the Minneapolis Tribune and if you give me the dope<lb/>
or if you can get it somewhere, I will quietly tip him off so that they will not<lb/>
make this mistake again without a little investigation. Of course it is no use<lb/>
for me to correct this publicly. That would be more offensive than useful.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04506030"/>
P.S.: I heartily approve your suggestion that the amount of income for Blossom<lb/>
Reed be increased.<lb/>
