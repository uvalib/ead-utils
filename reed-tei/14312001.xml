<salute>Dearest Mumsie-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been so<lb/>
busy all week that<lb/>
I put off writing from<lb/>
day to day, until here<lb/>
is Sunday again, and<lb/>
just a week since I<lb/>
last wrote you. In<lb/>
the meantime, I have<lb/>
finished my pink dress<lb/>
and made three very<lb/>
pretty shirt waists from<lb/>
the white stuff Art<lb/>
sent me last fall. I<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14312002"/>
enclose a check for <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>20.,<lb/>
which will, I think<lb/>
pay Art for the nain-<lb/>
sook you say he has<lb/>
sent, and likewise for<lb/>
Martha's aprons and the<lb/>
little night gowns you<lb/>
were to have made.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear you<lb/>
can have my dress<lb/>
made so quickly, and<lb/>
I am waiting anxiously<lb/>
for your next letter to<lb/>
hear more about it.<lb/>
Please, mother, keep an<lb/>
account of what it<lb/>
costs and my cape, for<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14312003"/>
the first of next month I will be able<lb/>
to send more money, and I don't want<lb/>
you to spend very much of yours<lb/>
on <unclear>me;</unclear> I don't suppose you will be<lb/>
satisfied unless you spend some.</p>
<p>You will rejoice with me that it<lb/>
seems as if Rannie's position is def-<lb/>
initely fixed, and that the decision has<lb/>
been that he is to remain as the<lb/>
Chief Surgeon of Gen. Lee's enlarged prov-<lb/>
ince. That is what we wanted and<lb/>
the General was so sweet about it,<lb/>
this is the way it came about. There<lb/>
were renewed attempts to get Rannie<lb/>
sent to Havana, and Gen. Wood told<lb/>
Gen. L. he thought Dr. Gorgas would be<lb/>
his Chief Surgeon, and that he would<lb/>
have Dr. Ives and Dr. Kean look after<lb/>
Havana. So our General told Rannie<lb/>
to consult with Dr. Gorgas, and they<lb/>
could decide which would be the Sani-<lb/>
tary Officer and he would try to fix<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14312004"/>
it the way they wanted<lb/>
it. As we knew, Rannie<lb/>
found Dr. Gorgas anxious<lb/>
to have Havana and<lb/>
delighted to have Rannie<lb/>
left as Gen. Lee's Chief<lb/>
Surgeon, so together they<lb/>
went to the Palace<lb/>
where Gen. Lee and Gen.<lb/>
Wood were in consul-<lb/>
tation, and told Gen. L.<lb/>
their wishes, and it<lb/>
<add>was</add> arranged accordingly.<lb/>
Tho' Gen. W. showed some<lb/>
reluctance, so I am sure<lb/>
Gen. Ludlow and Col. Black<lb/>
had been talking to him<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14312005"/>
about Dr. Gorgas.<lb/>
Another joyful thing is<lb/>
that Gen. Lee is to<lb/>
keep his headquarters<lb/>
out here for the summer,<lb/>
for they do not wish<lb/>
to have any more non-<lb/>
immunes in the city than<lb/>
they can help. So you<lb/>
see every thing is turn-<lb/>
ing out nicely, for six<lb/>
months anyhow, and<lb/>
Gen. Ludlow leaves<lb/>
next Saturday, so I<lb/>
think affairs are set-<lb/>
tled. Mrs. Wood is<lb/>
thinking seriously of<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14312006"/>
spending the summer in Cuba,<lb/>
and if she does she will come to<lb/>
Quemados.</p>
<p>Wednesday Rannie and I drove over to<lb/>
see Mrs. Ladd and Mrs. Steadman,<lb/>
who had stopped there on her way<lb/>
north. We drove over the Gen.'s new<lb/>
road, which is partially finished<lb/>
and the pontoon bridge is across the<lb/>
river for use until a fine iron one<lb/>
can be put in place. It is going<lb/>
to be a beautiful calzada, running<lb/>
along the top of the ridge within<lb/>
right of the sea all the way.<lb/>
This afternoon there is to be a foot-<lb/>
ball game between a team of the<lb/>
officers and a team of Cubans. I<lb/>
cannot imagine anything more fool-<lb/>
ish, for, of course, none of the men<lb/>
are in training and it is a<lb/>
very warm day. Poor Mrs. Lee is<lb/>
still in her room, so I am going<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f14312007"/>
with the General in<lb/>
the big carriage. Rannie<lb/>
Martha and Caz are<lb/>
going in the &ldquo;Ancestreal<lb/>
coach&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Every time Mrs. Lee ven-<lb/>
tures out of her room<lb/>
she gets a relapse of<lb/>
both bronchitis and<lb/>
asthma. You have no<lb/>
idea how thin she<lb/>
has gotten. I have<lb/>
started a &ldquo;feeding up&rdquo;<lb/>
process of milk punches<lb/>

at night etc., and Rannie<lb/>
has found something<lb/>
that seems to relieve<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f14312008"/>
her spasms, so I trust<lb/>
she will soon have<lb/>
a decided turn for<lb/>
the better.</p>
<p>Please thank father<lb/>
for his letter and for<lb/>
ordering the oil, which<lb/>
I think will be here on<lb/>
the Sedgewick either<lb/>
today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>The foot ball game was<lb/>
a great success. The poor<lb/>
Cubanos were not in<lb/>
it, tho' we hear they<lb/>
had been practicing, and<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f14312009"/>
were willing to bet even money<lb/>
on their team! All our men played<lb/>
very well- Mr. Humphrey is the hero,<lb/>
having made a fine run. Mr. Reeder<lb/>
played center. It was really great fun.</p>
<p>Caz is going to take this letter<lb/>
in to post it for me so goodnight.<lb/>
With love to all</p>
<closer>
<salute>most lovingly</salute>
