<salute>My Dear Mother-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Bogot&aacute; at last- after ten days on the boat and<lb/>
train and a very wonderful place it is- I only<lb/>
wish we were going to stay long enough to thoroughly<lb/>
explore it and see something of the people,<lb/>
but Father, Dr. Guiteras and I expect to leave<lb/>
in two days for the coast, the rest of the party<lb/>
following later. We had all expected to leave at<lb/>
this time, but there is a report of an outbreak<lb/>
of yellow fever at <unclear>Muso</unclear> (where the emerald<lb/>
mines are) and the Colombian people were<lb/>
very anxious for some of the Commission<lb/>
to go there. Drs. Gorgas, Lyster, &amp; Whitmore and<lb/>
Wm. Wrightson are going and (to save delay)<lb/>
Guiteras and Dad will investigate the<lb/>
Coast <del>while</del> in the meanwhile, I have<lb/>
had a most cordial invitation from Mrs.<lb/>
Curtis at the American Legation to stay there<lb/>
and go down when the <unclear>Muso</unclear> party returns,<lb/>

2-<lb/>
but I prefer going down with Dad and<lb/>
Guiteras. Also, instead of going onto Caracas<lb/>
with the party I am going back to Panama<lb/>
and stay for a month or so with Mrs. Her-<lb/>
rick. I've had indigestion &ldquo;to beat the band&rdquo;<lb/>
on this trip and Father thinks the kind of<lb/>
food we have to eat has a lot to do with it.<lb/>
He didn't intend to take me up the Amazon<lb/>
anyway, but both he and I were very anx-<lb/>
ious for me to see Caracas and Trinidad<lb/>
and Barbados. However, I couldn't get to Panama<lb/>
from there and of the two things I think I'd<lb/>
have a nicer time by going back to Panama,<lb/>
though, of course, there'd be nothing new to see<lb/>
there.</p>
<p>Last night Mr. Putnam - who came down on the<lb/>
boat with me - send me a gorgeous bunch of red<lb/>
carnations on a silver tray- Unfortunately the only<lb/>
thing I can wear when he calls is the purple<lb/>
velvet dress and they dont &ldquo;go to-gether.&rdquo; However, I<lb/>
sent him a very appreciative letter about them.<lb/>
By the way, tell Sylvia she &ldquo;saved my life&rdquo;<lb/>
when she got me to put in that purple dress-<lb/>
she and Ed. having both advised me to do so.</p>

<p>Its <hi>cold</hi> up here - colder than Cartago was and<lb/>
there's not a chimney in town, so you see<lb/>
that most of my outfit would be pretty &ldquo;airy&rdquo;<lb/>
up here. The purple velvet is just the thing<lb/>
for the afternoon - either with my purple<lb/>
straw hat or the gold one.</p>
<p>We are going to a dinner at the American<lb/>
Legation to-morrow night and to-morrow after-<lb/>
noon some of the ladies of Bogot&aacute; are coming<lb/>
at 4, to call on Mrs. Gorgas and myself.<lb/>
Also we have asked Mr. Putnam to breakfast<lb/>
at twelve so it will be quite a busy day.</p>
<p>We (Dad and I) went to market this<lb/>
morning. &ldquo;Oodles&rdquo; of fruit - some new even<lb/>
to Father - and some very pretty flowers:<lb/>
sweet peas, gladiolus and lilies especially so-<lb/>
The market people have broad faces and<lb/>
are mainly Indian I think- All the<lb/>
men wear woolen ponchos which they call<lb/>

<del>Ruanas</del> &ldquo;Ruanas&rdquo; here. I got you another<lb/>
silver bowl to-day - bigger than the one<lb/>
I got you in Lima and hope you will like<lb/>
it a lot. I do.</p>
<p>Daddy is very well and sends much love.<lb/>
Take care of yourself, my darling Mother,<lb/>
keep well and &ldquo;be a good lady&rdquo; and use<lb/>
the electric fan if it gets too hot.</p>
<p>Please give lots of love to the girls I've<lb/>
no time to write except to you, but I<lb/>
know they both understand that- I hope<lb/>
they're having a pleasant summer.</p>
<p>I must stop now as it seems my one<lb/>
opportunity to talk.</p>
<p>With dear love to you all from Dad<lb/>
and myself (Ed of course included) <del>a</del></p>

Love to Jennie also and remembrances<lb/>
as needed<lb/>

Please send my bathing suit to the Hotel Tivoli by<lb/>
parcels post. Mark &ldquo;bathing suit, (used)&rdquo; on the<lb/>
package so they won't hold it for duty. Suit is in bottom drawer<lb/>
of little chiffonier in the girl's room<lb/>
<seg>
P. S. I expect to be back in Baltimore about the<lb/>
first of October. That ought to be staying away long enough<lb/>
to help get rid of the indigestion- tho' I haven't had much success yet.<lb/>
