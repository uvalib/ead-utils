General Albert E. Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco, California<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I developed an acute gastroenteritis in mid-December and have been home<lb/>
until today. I am feeling better again but quite tired. I anticipate<lb/>
going to Havana for a quick trip, leaving here January 19, first for<lb/>
Colorade Springs and Kansas City. It occurred to me that I might be<lb/>
able, somehow, to stimulate our kind but procrastinating Cuban friends<lb/>
to deliver to you and to the other yellow fever personalities the decora-<lb/>
tions which they voted over a year ago. Within a few months after my<lb/>
own trip to Havana, I wrote to Pedro Nogueira two or three times hinting rather<lb/>
strongly that since they had been kind enough to vote these honors and<lb/>
since the potential recipients had heard about it via newspapers and<lb/>
otherwise, it would be a very kind thing if they could deliver the medals<lb/>
as they said they would. It was announced in the newspapers that they<lb/>
would be delivered to the American recipients via Cuban embassies, con-<lb/>
sulates, etc., but I know Pedro had another idea. He tried, and failed,<lb/>
to receive authorization to <unclear><del>p</del> bring <del>t</del></unclear> them himself to the States at the<lb/>
time of a medical meeting; he can be admired for his desire to present<lb/>
these personally as certainly nobody else would have understood their<lb/>
significance and done the honors as well as he. Since he was not<lb/>
authorized to do it, I imagine the matter is hanging fire.</p>
<p>If you are in the mood to do so, why don't you help me start the ball<lb/>
rolling by &ldquo;prodding me.&rdquo; May I suggest that you write me a letter<lb/>
somewhat as follows, changing it as you wish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Doctor Hench:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the New York Times a couple of months ago there was a little note<lb/>
stating that you were to visit Havana and receive a decoration from the<lb/>
Cuban Government. How I wish that I myself could visit Havana again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of decorations, whatever became of the Finlay Medals granted<lb/>
to certain yellow fever personalities, the children of Reed, Lazear, etc.,<lb/>
and to several others of us old-timers? I heard indirectly a year ago<lb/>
of this honor and heard somewhere that I might receive the decoration<lb/>
through the local Cuban consulate. I have heard nothing further. As<lb/>
time is marching on, I wonder if we who were to receive the Finlay Medal<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04701003"/>
General Albert E. Truby &nbsp;&nbsp; - 2 - &nbsp;&nbsp; January 5, 1954<lb/>
will hear anything further. Perhaps you could make some discrete in-<lb/>
quiry from some of our mutual friends in Havana when you go there. I<lb/>
am sure that General Reed, Blossom Reed and Lazear's children would be<lb/>
as pleased as I would be to receive the medal as certainly it is a very<lb/>
real honor and I, for one, appreciate it greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
