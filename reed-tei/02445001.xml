Dr. Howard H. Kelly,<lb/>
1418 <unclear>Euteno</unclear> Place<lb/>
Baltimore, M<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi><lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Kelly.</salute>
</opener>
<p>In reply to your inquiry for<lb/>
Reprints on &ldquo;Flies in the transmission of<lb/>
Typhoid&rdquo; I regret to say that I have never<lb/>
had any Reprints; my Report on the Prevalence<lb/>
of Typhoid Fever in the District of Columbia was<lb/>
published in the Health Officers Report D.C. for<lb/>
1895, and it is possible that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward may<lb/>
be able to mail you a Copy of the Report, al-<lb/>
though he informed me some time ago, that<lb/>
these Reports had been all distributed; My Report<lb/>
was based upon 500 cases selected at random from<lb/>
among those occurring in the District between July <unclear>1st</unclear><lb/>
&amp; October 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1895.</p>
<p>In speaking of the mode of dissemination on<lb/>
p: 260, I say &ldquo;Prof. Finkler of Bonn a very<lb/>
competent observer, believes that the disease may<lb/>
be communicated by intimate contact, living in<lb/>
the same room, or breathing the same air and<lb/>
accounts in this way for a number of outbreaks in<lb/>
his section. In 1886 a young woman who had<lb/>
been called to one hamlet to nurse her children,<lb/>
returned to her home was taken sick with typhoid<lb/>
fever, communicated the disease to her Nurse<lb/>
and subsequently 50 other cases developed which<lb/>
could not be traced to soil pollution or infected<lb/>
water x x x<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02445002"/>
2<lb/>
I have found similar instances in my present<lb/>
investigation, but it is practically impossible to say<lb/>
whether in these cases the germs were conveyed<lb/>
through the fingers or through the air or by means<lb/>
of flies infecting the food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On p: 266 in speaking of a group of typhoid fever<lb/>
cases I say, &ldquo;All of the cases on Blacksburg<lb/>
road and vicinity except those on Lewis Street,<lb/>
occurred in houses supplied with boxprivies. It<lb/>
was admitted, that the stools from typhoid fever<lb/>
patients residing on Blacksburg Road were<lb/>
thrown upon the ground without disinfection,<lb/>
and as the drainage from these houses is in<lb/>
the direction of Trinidad Avenue and King <unclear>Kised</unclear><lb/>
the residents there were exposed to infection. There<lb/>
is abundant evidence of unlawful surface<lb/>
pollution and stagnant kitchen slops may be<lb/>
observed on Trinidad Avenue in a number of<lb/>
places, and as the germs find a suitable soil<lb/>
in such surroundings it is possible, that the flies<lb/>
which abound wherever surface pollution exists<lb/>
may carry the germs into the houses and con-<lb/>
taminate the food or drink. <del>s &amp;</del> There was<lb/>
nothing in common in the milk supply of the<lb/>
different houses, and, as there was no well liable<lb/>
to contamination from the first source, it is not<lb/>
improbable that the infection was conveyed in<lb/>
the manner indicated.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="3" id="f02445003"/>
<p><hi>3</hi>.</p>
<p>On p: 270 in speaking of a group of cases in<lb/>
adjoining houses on I Street N. E. I say,<lb/>
&ldquo;The first case occurred on July 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> at N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi><lb/>
1016 -- the next case August 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> in N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 1014, fol-<lb/>
lowed by two others cases in the same house Aug<lb/>
22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> and Septbr 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Another case occurred at<lb/>
No 1010 October 24&rdquo; <del>There was nothing in common<lb/>
with the milk supply, and the fact that the cases</del><lb/>
The houses in the entire row are supplied with<lb/>
box privies and the general surroundings are very<lb/>
unsanitary. There was nothing in common with<lb/>
the milk supply, and the fact that the cases<lb/>
occurred at considerable intervals indicates with<lb/>
more or less certainty that the first case was a<lb/>
focus of infection; but how the germs were carried<lb/>
unless by flies, or through the air, is a matter<lb/>
impossible to determine.</p>
<p>On p. 271 -- reference is made to cases occurring<lb/>
in houses located near places defiled with excite-<lb/>
ment, or where typhoid <unclear>dejecta</unclear> had been deposited<lb/>
and that there is much reason for assuming, that<lb/>
infection was carried from the unsanitary conditions<lb/>
referred to.</p>
<p>On p. 280 in speaking of Box Privies I say<lb/>
&ldquo;These boxes, even if there were no wells are still<lb/>
a source of danger in so far as they favor the<lb/>
transmission of germs by <hi>means of infected flies</hi><lb/>
nor can the possibility be ignored that these organisms<lb/>
in leaky or overflowing boxes may reach the upper<lb/>
layer of the <unclear>sick</unclear> and with pulverized dust, gain access<lb/>
to the system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have made these Extracts fearing that you may not be able to secure a Copy<lb/>
of the Report for permanent retention, you can doubtless borrow a Copy and verify<lb/>
the excerpts.- I presume you have sent Dr. L. O. Howard's Monograph published<lb/>
by the Washington Academy of Sciences.</p>
