<p>You weren't much bigger <del><unclear>in last Thurs</unclear></del><add>when you</add><lb/>

the Dark Night&rdquo; &ldquo;with <unclear>henny</unclear> Papa&rdquo; &ldquo;and a Big<lb/>
Dog&rdquo;,- I think <hi>he</hi> ought to be <hi>all</hi> capitals,<lb/>
and I wish I had stayed over Monday, you would<lb/>
have had no bother at all, I am inclined to<lb/>
think this trouble came from your nervous<lb/>
condition (physical &amp; pschycical) rather than the<lb/>
reverse-this is despite of Freud.</p>
<p>Of course there have got to be Naval Officers<lb/>
&amp; therefore I presume women have got to<lb/>
Marry them. Yet I sh'd say that it by no means<lb/>
an ideal life the navy women lead.  A<lb/>
life that one would require very cogent<lb/>
reasons to elect. I do not agree with you that the<lb/>
man is useful only during war, because<lb/>

===================<lb/>
readiness to fight efficiently is at all times<lb/>
useful to prevent war. His work is<lb/>
always useful &amp; most useful where<lb/>
by his efficiently he renders war<lb/>
<hi>w</hi>ith the U.S inadvisable to another country.<lb/>
But his wife's position seems to me<lb/>
cruelly hard &amp; only a perfect willingness<lb/>
to <del>life</del> live single - like Marian Carter - or - <unclear><del>a-gr</del></unclear>an<lb/>
absorbing passion would render - it endurable<lb/>
Do you remember your little piece &ldquo;I will<lb/>
not love you <del>k</del>new.&rdquo; That seems to express<lb/>
<hi>w</hi>hat I think on the subject - as I think it did you  of <unclear>Feeling</unclear>.<lb/>
Also of all the naval men I have seen Mr. Bur-<lb/>
well was the only one as a man - not consider-<lb/>
ing the disadvantage of his occupation -I <del>tho</del> ever<lb/>
thought was your-equal-in your-class so to<lb/>
speak. I had no special objection to Mr. F. <del>nor</del> in-<lb/>
deed <del>what was told of</del> his shooting the stock on<lb/>
the Reina Mercedes was, especially as he never<lb/>
said a word of it, <del>was</del> a gallant action, a very<lb/>
gallant action, &amp; if you had really cared for<lb/>
him I would not have opposed you. Yet I would<lb/>
have<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fC0127050"/>
have been sorry &amp; <hi>very</hi> doubtful if you would<lb/>
have been happy. I don't think you would<lb/>
have been. <del>He</del> First his occupation &amp; 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>, while<lb/>
he was a man, which <del>none</del><add>few</add> of the others showed<lb/>
themselves, yet he was not a man of refinement<lb/>
nor of real elevation of feeling <add>(&amp; he was most uncommonly queer)</add>. Burwell was<lb/>
both. My own opinion is that the distance of<lb/>
time thows a certain glamour <del>of</del><add>over</add> him &amp; any<lb/>
girl naturally likes a man who shews openly<lb/>
that he greatly admires her, especially if he<lb/>
be a manly man. You did very wisely in not<lb/>
letting - or - making - yourself care for him. If<lb/>
you had &amp; had accepted him I think it would<lb/>
have been a <add>great</add> pity &amp; the odds heavily a-<lb/>
gainst your leading a happy life. Unless<lb/>
you did, or lied most successfully, I would have<lb/>
<hi>n</hi>ot been happy either<lb/>.</p>
<p>We purpose to leave on the <hi>28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi> in the morning<lb/>
&amp; to lay over - at S. Francisco from 2.08 P.M. Oct 2 to<lb/>

So I hope you will get here<lb/>
about the 20 - or - 19. in the evening<lb/>
Sunday is the best day to travel<lb/>
as the Pullmans are not crowded<lb/>
that day. If you could leave Satur-<lb/>
day night you would have a <del>pleaster</del><lb/>
pleasanter trip than<lb/>
any other day. Saturday however is the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Monday<lb/>
<hi>is</hi> the most crowded day in the week.<lb/>
We will finish the packing <add>except trunk, Tuesday</add>. I think but<lb/>
leave somethings for your judgement. I will<lb/>
engage the sleeping berths tomorrow &amp; write<lb/>
to <unclear>Truster,</unclear> at Angel Island, to get my state-<lb/>
rooms: - Have to send check. Also will take down<lb/>
about 100 lbs of books to see if I can sell them<lb/>
&amp; leave about 250 to 300 lbs more behind<lb/>
-unpacked. We take no crockery &amp; <hi>very</hi> few winter<lb/>
<hi>clothes</hi> - those by freight. Take a very few books<lb/>
good night my dear. Commend me to Drs Hamman &amp;<lb/>
Watson &amp; to the chief nurse, &amp; should you see her Miss Rio-<lb/>
<hi>p</hi>elle.</p>
