<salute>My dear Kean,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yours of April 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> received,<lb/>
Magoons trip to Washington has<lb/>
cleared up the atmosphere a good<lb/>
deal as for as he &amp; I am concerned.</p>
<p>I think that he has found out<lb/>
that the success of the Sanitary De-<lb/>
partment has not interfered with<lb/>
his reputation as governor and that<lb/>
a technical reputation as a sanita-<lb/>
rian would not advance his<lb/>
chances for advancement.</p>
<p>At any rate we have been two<lb/>
<unclear>cooing doves</unclear> since his return.</p>
<p>You probably understand the<lb/>
present organization of the work<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06210002"/>
2<lb/>
shouts as Chairman is really the head.<lb/>
The government, engineer department,<lb/>
auditing, purchasing, &amp; pay depart-<lb/>
ments being subdivisions reporting<lb/>
directly to him.</p>
<p>I feel pretty sure that we will<lb/>
have a reorganization as soon as<lb/>
Congress adjourns. Now I want<lb/>
one of two things. Either that<lb/>
the Sanitary <del>Department</del> Bureau<lb/>
be raised to the plan of the other<lb/>
department<del>s</del> &amp; report directly to<lb/>
the chairman, or that the Chief San-<lb/>
itary Officer be made governor<lb/>
when Magoon leaves.</p>
<p>There are many good arguments<lb/>
why the Sanitary Department should<lb/>
be raised to the <unclear>planed</unclear> of the other<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06210003"/>
3<lb/>
department. Sanita<del>tion</del> is generally recog-<lb/>
nized as being only second to the<lb/>
Engineer Department in importance in<lb/>
the construction of the Canal.</p>
<p>The Chief Sanitary Officers duties<lb/>
are vastly more intimate with the<lb/>
Engineers than with the Government.<lb/>
This most important duty is that<lb/>
concerning the health of the Engi-<lb/>
neer laborers. But besides his<lb/>
duties pertain to enforcing health<lb/>
measures against the Government,<lb/>
Auditing, Purchasing &amp; Pay De-<lb/>
partments. And besides he is<lb/>
the health officer of Colon &amp; Pan-<lb/>
ama deriving his authority entirely<lb/>
from the President of Panama<lb/>
&amp; outside the jurisdiction of the<lb/>
U.S. I am trying to point<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06210004"/>
out that the function of the San-<lb/>
itary Department are much more<lb/>
extensive than than those of any<lb/>
other department, &amp; more important<lb/>
than those of any other except the<lb/>
Engineer, &amp; therefor should not be<lb/>
a bureau &amp; subject to any one of<lb/>
these. Magoon has had a<lb/>
resolution passed authorizing<lb/>
his executive secretary practically<lb/>
to act as governor in his ab-<lb/>
sence. Now Reed is just as<lb/>
nice a fellow &amp; as sensible as<lb/>
could hold that position, but<lb/>
I do not think it right or dig-<lb/>
nified that the Chief Sanitary<lb/>
Officer for three months should<lb/>
have to receive orders &amp; all his<lb/>

ISTHMIAN CANAL ZONE<lb/>
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH<lb/>
----<lb/>
OFFICE OF CHIEF SANITARY OFFICER<lb/>
ANCON, C. Z.<lb/>
authorizations from a man<lb/>
in Reeds position.</p>
<p>I have talked over freely to Shouts<lb/>
this matter of making the Sanitary<lb/>
Department independent about<lb/>
as I have written it here. We<lb/>
approves the idea and gives me<lb/>
to understand that he will bring<lb/>
it about if he can.</p>
<p>If the Sanitary Office were<lb/>
made Governor I think that it<lb/>
would be an even better solu-<lb/>
tion. I would then be the head<lb/>
of a department reporting directly<lb/>
to the Chairman &amp; besides have<lb/>
the prestige of governorship be-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06210006"/>
6<lb/>
hind me. Magoon tells me that<lb/>
he has no definite position ahead of<lb/>
him, but many things make me think<lb/>
that he does not expect to stay down<lb/>
here long. It seems to me that<lb/>
when the canal gets well under way<lb/>
we will not be under the lime light<lb/>
as we have been in the past. In<lb/>
that case the governorship will not<lb/>
be as desirable to a man with po-<lb/>
litical ambitions as it has been in<lb/>
the past.</p>
<p>I do not know exactly of any<lb/>
way in which Gen. O Reilly can as-<lb/>
sist me in these matters, but merely<lb/>
write to let you know my plans<lb/>
and what I am driving at, so<lb/>
that if any opportunity should<lb/>
come up he can act intelligent-<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06210007"/>

ly with matter.</p>
<p>I have heard nothing whatever<lb/>
with regard to my candidacy for<lb/>
the Surgeon <unclear>Generalcy</unclear> since I talked<lb/>
the matter over with Gen. O'Reilly,<lb/>
now have my views undergone any<lb/>
change on that subject.</p>
<p>Every thing continues to progress<lb/>
favorably in the Sanitary De-<lb/>
partment. No yellow fever<lb/>
since December 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and the<lb/>
health of the force remarkably<lb/>
good.</p>
<p>With kindest regards I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
