Mr. Gust. E. Lambert,<lb/>
5101 Kimbark Ave.,<lb/>
Chicago, Ill.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Lambert:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have read your letter of February 21 with a great deal of<lb/>
pleasure and am glad to know the details of your fine service in con-<lb/>
nection with the yellow fever work at Camp Columbia. I am a little<lb/>
ashamed that when your name first came up, I did not recall it as<lb/>
that of the man who took such faithful care of me when I had yellow<lb/>
fever, and also looked after Major Edmunds and others who were attacked<lb/>
by yellow fever at that time. I think it is extraordinary that you did<lb/>
not get infected at Major Edmunds' house, because as I had lived in that<lb/>
house I recall that it was not screened. I think I got my infection<lb/>
from his case I visited him in the early morning the day before he<lb/>
died, and talked with the nurse through the open window, as General Lee<lb/>
had ordered me not to visit any more yellow fever cases.</p>
<p>I regret very much that with all your experience in the care<lb/>
of yellow fever cases you were not oneof those who underwent the exper-<lb/>
iments of the Reed Board so that you could be included in the list of<lb/>
the experimental cases which are given pensions. I wish that all of<lb/>
our fine lads who worked in connection with yellow fever as nurses and<lb/>
in any other capacities could have been included, but this would have<lb/>
been quite an indefinite list, and the Committee have decided to limit<lb/>
the list to those named in the reports as volunteers for the experimental<lb/>
tests.</p>
<p>You have every reason to be proud of your service in spite of<lb/>
the fact that you are not on that list. I am sending a copy of this<lb/>
letter to The Surgeon General for his information and for file.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>J. R. Kean</signed>
Colonel, U.S. Army, Retd.<lb/>
