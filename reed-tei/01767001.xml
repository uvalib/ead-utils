<salute>My dear Pillula:</salute>
</opener>
<p>There are no official letters for you -- none from Myers-<lb/>
A package from Mrs. Cron, came by Thomas mail to-day- Cravats &amp; c-</p>
<p>Your letter, dated Eagle<lb/>
Creek, January 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, has just been received-<lb/>
I am told by the Serg't. Major that the<lb/>
mail for your Scouting <add>Party</add> is to be forwarded<lb/>
to Bowie, on Thursday Morning, which being<lb/>
the case, I send this &amp; several letters from<lb/>
your girl- I suppose when you get to<lb/>
Bowie, you will ascertain that there<lb/>
is no immediate necessity for your<lb/>
wading through very much &ldquo;gore&rdquo;- Both<lb/>
Co's of cav. were ordered from here at<lb/>
first- &amp; then that order was revoked<lb/>
&amp; &ldquo;E&rdquo; Co. only ordered, &amp; by the time that<lb/>
Cap't. Adam had mounted the heights<lb/>
of Turkey Creek Hill, &amp; <hi>before</hi> W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi><lb/>
the conqueror, had got <hi>half way up</hi>,<lb/>
<del>An</del> a telegram came whizzing along<lb/>
recalling them- and so like the great<lb/>
Emperor of Austria, having &ldquo;marched<lb/>
up the hill,&rdquo; they gracefully &ldquo;marched<lb/>
back again&rdquo;- and a pretty disgusted<lb/>
looking crowd &ldquo;E&rdquo; Co. was, too, on its<lb/>
return. They were only too happy<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01767002"/>
to escape from Apache, but didn't quite<lb/>
succeed- Our mess was temporarily smashed<lb/>
up, Cap't. J. going to Kingsbury's to board &amp; I<lb/>
to the K.O.'S- Hesche! Capt. J. still remains at<lb/>
K's, but I have returned, &amp; we have a quiet<lb/>
duet, 3 times a day- But now <hi>to business</hi>- If<lb/>
the news of your order to Bowie played the<lb/>
devil with you, your letter, my dear Pillula,<lb/>
played <hi>the particular &ldquo;Old Scratch&rdquo;</hi> with me<lb/>
&amp; my plans- On the strength of your desire to<lb/>
go into the field rather than remain alone, at<lb/>
Apache, I had concluded that I need not trouble<lb/>
myself about scouting duty- And inasmuch as<lb/>
Lt. Kingsbury had offered to <del>B</del> board my wife &amp;<lb/>
myself, I had written a letter to her &amp; had mailed<lb/>
it, telling <add>her</add> to get ready to come back to Fort Apa-<lb/>
che, by middle of march -- upon the receipt of your<lb/>
letter, however, in which you say that you won't<lb/>
go on another scout, I went at once &amp; recalled<lb/>
my letter- &amp; shall not send it, till I can get a defi-<lb/>
-nite answer from you- Of course, if I must<lb/>
do scouting duty, I don't want my wife at Apa-<lb/>
che, but as I have <hi>twice</hi> offered to go in your<lb/>
place, &amp; both times you preferred to go, please<lb/>
answer me definitely whether you intend to do the<lb/>
field duty, or want me to do half of it -- so that I can<lb/>
then know how to act definitely -- you understand my dear<lb/>
Pillula that I am much interested in this matter, &amp; should dis-<lb/>
like to be ordered out on a scout, after my wife arrives- I may<lb/>
have misconstrued your meaning-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Please answer at once &amp;<lb/>
very much oblige<lb/>
your impatient friend,</salute>
<signed>Bolus</signed>-
<seg>
P.S. Kick Tom-<lb/>
my Cruse for<lb/>
me, &amp; tell him<lb/>
that I have<lb/>
completely<lb/>
<hi>cured</hi> Joe's<lb/>
<hi>ears</hi>, &amp; that<lb/>
he is now per-<lb/>
fectly happy<lb/>
&amp; gets lots to<lb/>
Eat- Regards<lb/>
to Mr Gatewood.<lb/>
Bolus.<lb/>
&ldquo;Joe&rdquo; sends<lb/>
love to Tommy-<lb/>
Has just let<lb/>
