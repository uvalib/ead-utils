Hon. George C. Perkins,<lb/>
U. S. Senator,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Information has recently come to me that The<lb/>
Merchants Association of New York, acting in conjunction with<lb/>
The American Medical Association, has applied to Congress for<lb/>
an increase of pension to the family of Dr. Lazear who lost his<lb/>
life in Cuba through efforts to establish the fact that typhoid<lb/>
fever and some other infectious diseases are disseminated by<lb/>
mosquitoes, and that a bill - No. 1168 - has been introduced by<lb/>
Senator Knox to that end; also one in the House - No. 4375 - by<lb/>
the Honorable E. H. Hinshaw of Nebraska.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are engaged in doing so many kind acts<lb/>
that you have forgotten you gave me very effective assistance<lb/>
in procuring the first pension for this family. Some of the<lb/>
Senators were then disposed to refuse any aid upon the ground<lb/>
that Dr. Lazear had gone too far in making experiments upon<lb/>
himself - that his action savored of suicide and was a bad ex-<lb/>
ample to posterity. You personally introduced me to these<lb/>
Senators, and, through statements obtained from General Wood<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00444013"/>
-2-<lb/>
and others, explaining the circumstances under which Dr. Lazear<lb/>
met his death, their objections were overcome and the original<lb/>
pension voted.</p>
<p>On behalf of the widow of Dr. Lazear, who is un-<lb/>
married, and his children, I most respectfully and earnestly<lb/>
invite your attention to this proposed legislation. They are<lb/>
still living in this State. As you may remember, Mrs. Lazear<lb/>
was born in California, being the daughter of W. J. Houston<lb/>
who was formerly in business at San Francisco, but died long<lb/>
since. I am credibly advised that this little increase would<lb/>
be very acceptable in helping to support and educate the minor<lb/>
children and is greatly needed for that purpose.</p>
<p>I will send a copy of this letter to Senator Flint,<lb/>
and also to each member of the House from this State. You<lb/>
will be able to explain to them more fully about the case,<lb/>
if requested, so this letter need not be prolonged.</p>
<p>With thanks, in advance, for the kind attention<lb/>
which I feel sure you will give this application, and with best<lb/>
wishes, I am, as ever, dear Senator,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very truly,</salute>
<signed>E. S. Pillsbury</signed>
