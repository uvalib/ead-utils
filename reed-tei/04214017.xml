Colonel Raymond O. Dart<lb/>
Director, Army Institute of Pathology<lb/>
7th Street and Independence Avenue, S. W.<lb/>
Washington 25, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Dart:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just received your letter of March 30 and it is going to<lb/>
be very difficult for me to conform to the requirements which your Com-<lb/>
mittee on Exhibits has set up. I do not question the propriety of their<lb/>
decision that all exhibits must be completed by 8 o'clock in the morning,<lb/>
May 10, and remain intact until 2 p.m. May 15. However, I do not at the<lb/>
moment see how I can possibly get the exhibit up until May 11. Unfor-<lb/>
tunately, I have made commitments rather far in advance. I have to be in<lb/>
Minneapolis May 6 and In New York on May 9. As General Chairman in charge<lb/>
of an International Congress on Rheumatic Diseases to be held in New York<lb/>
at the Waldorf in June, 1949, we have set May 9 for a very important com-<lb/>
mittee meeting. I simply cannot get to New York before May 9. I am speaking<lb/>
in Charlottesville, Virginia on the evening of May 10 and much of the material<lb/>
which you are asking me to exhibit is now on loan at the University of Vir-<lb/>
ginia. I can pick it up on May 10, speak in Charlottesville that evening and<lb/>
arrive in Washington the morning of the 11th. I do not know of anybody that<lb/>
I feel inclined to entrust the job of setting up this exhibit for me. Indeed<lb/>
quite a lot of the material is here at home, the rest I have set up at the<lb/>
University of Virginia. You might suggest that I merely ship it to someone<lb/>
and let them set it up for me. This I greatly hesitate to do because of my<lb/>
peculiar feeling toward the material. It has been entrusted to me by the<lb/>
families of Doctor Reed, Lazear and others and I do not feel that I own it.<lb/>
It is eventually to be permanently cared for probably in a little museum here in<lb/>
the Mayo Foundation. The material is absolutely irreplaceable and is priceless.<lb/>
Much of it is small, such as letters and medals which could easily be lost. I<lb/>
realize that you might suggest that one of your associates accept the respon-<lb/>
sibility for me but even so I do not feel too inclined to accept that arrange-<lb/>
ment. I know that even in the best run institution important data occasionally<lb/>
get lost. Two weeks ago in Cuba, Mr. John Moran one of Reed's first guinea pigs<lb/>
sadly told me that the University of Virginia Museum had lost a letter which<lb/>
was to him most precious, a letter of commendation from Reed to Moran written<lb/>
in Reed's own handwriting. Although this letter was loaned to the University<lb/>
of Virginia Library and was in direct charge of the Curator, it was loaned to<lb/>
a professor in a class and disappeared.</p>
<p>If your committee will make an exception and allow me to set the<lb/>
exhibit up myself the morning of May 11, well and good. You state that the<lb/>
exhibit is to be kept intact until May 15. I understood this Congress lasted<lb/>
until the 18th. I haven't yet thought out how I can retrieve my exhibit be-<lb/>
cause I will have to leave Washington myself on the 13th but once the exhibit<lb/>
is intact and set up, I am not as concerned about its loss as about the pos-<lb/>
sible loss in transportation.</p>

<p>I have found out from Doctor Bulbulian, the man in charge of the<lb/>
Mayo Clinic scientific exhibits that no one from this Clinic is presenting<lb/>
any other exhibits at this Congress, therefore, I cannot put the material in<lb/>
the hands of the usual Clinic personnel who set up special exhibits.<lb/>
I would appreciate your further comments on my problem.</p>
