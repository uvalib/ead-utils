<p>Still Fumbling with Yellow Fever.<lb/>
Very naturally we follow with almost<lb/>
thrilling interest the investigations of our<lb/>
medical amateurs into the causes, condi-<lb/>
tions, symptoms, and treatment of yellow<lb/>
fever. We have had a great deal of talent at<lb/>
our disposal in Cuba since January 1, 1899<lb/>
There were all sorts of reports, conjec-<lb/>
tures, and solemn announcements. We<lb/>
were told by Gen. Wood that brooms,<lb/>
shovels, carbolic acid, and sewers would<lb/>
kill yellow fever absolutely. How many<lb/>
hundreds of thousands of dollars were ex-<lb/>
pended in this way we do not quite re-<lb/>
call. In fact, it does not matter. Theo-<lb/>
ries were rife, hypotheses could be gath-<lb/>
ered like blackberries; everybody knew it<lb/>
all, and had his private prophylactic, so to<lb/>
speak, on tap.</p>
<p>Since then our old friend, yellow fever,<lb/>
has been busy with the various compla-<lb/>
cent declarations of the talent. It has<lb/>
challenged and disproved and laughed at<lb/>
every solemn dogma proclaimed by the<lb/>
anointed. We find, for example, in the<lb/>
Engineering News the ingenuous admis-<lb/>
sion by Surgeon Gorgas, who has been<lb/>
prominent as a discoverer and pioneer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One remarkable feature of this year's epidemic<lb/>
(in Havana) was that yellow fever cases occurred<lb/>
to an unusual extent in the more modern and better<lb/>
built portions of the city, considerably removed<lb/>
from what were formerly considered the centers of<lb/>
disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is nothing like really industrious<lb/>
investigation. Surgeon Gorgas has now<lb/>
realized what every yellow fever expert in<lb/>
New Orleans knew twenty-five years ago<lb/>
--that yellow fever is not a filth disease,<lb/>
and that its origin cannot be determined<lb/>
or its spread measured by the so-called<lb/>
scientific sanitation of the day. His inno-<lb/>
cent surprise when he learned that yel-<lb/>
low fever attacked the new, clean, well-<lb/>
kept suburbs of Havana and treated with<lb/>
scornful avoidance the alleged &ldquo;centers<lb/>
of infection&rdquo; is very touching, but not at<lb/>
all unexpected. The same phenomenon--<lb/>
if we may call it so--has been familiar to<lb/>
the New Orleans faculty for half a cen-<lb/>
tury. In the great epidemic of 1878 the<lb/>
disease made its first appearance in the<lb/>
Garden District--the most beautiful and<lb/>
well-kept part of the city, where there<lb/>
were only four to six residences on every<lb/>
block, and where premises were kept like<lb/>
a flower pot. Down town, in the old French<lb/>
Quarter, crowded, ill-drained, with the<lb/>
basins--heads of canals leading into Lake<lb/>
Pontchartrain--and the swarming popula-<lb/>
tion packed in miserable, unkempt dwell-<lb/>
ings--down there, the epidemic paid its<lb/>
latest visit. That district, with its reeking<lb/>
and malodorous gutters, its foul premises,<lb/>
and its frightful physical conditions, was<lb/>
the very last to be attacked. The yel-<lb/>
low fever exhausted the material in the<lb/>
Garden District before it invaded the<lb/>
slums. Surgeon Gorgas has at last real-<lb/>
ized a fact with which every yellow fever<lb/>
expert in New Orleans has been familiar<lb/>
for the past forty years.</p>
<p>We shall waste no time on this new<lb/>
&ldquo;mosquito hypothesis,&rdquo; further than to sug-<lb/>
gest that it is as ridiculous as the broom,<lb/>
shovel, carbolic acid, and sewerage hy-<lb/>
pothesis. It occurs to us to say, only,<lb/>
that until some gentleman discovers the<lb/>
cause of yellow fever, other gentlemen<lb/>
will be wise to cut short their speculations<lb/>
as to its spread and propagation and de-<lb/>
vote themselves humbly to its treatment.<lb/>
The latter is easy. The rest of it is so far<lb/>
beyond the powers of the select.</p>
