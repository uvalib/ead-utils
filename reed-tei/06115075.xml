<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The photostats arrived, and I shall be very glad to turn them<lb/>
over to you when I finish my work. I'll send them back to you<lb/>
with all your material.</p>
<p>I'm sorry you didn't meet Col. Jones, the SG's librarian. He<lb/>
is tall and handsome and nice - but you probably already knew<lb/>
him.</p>
<p>I'm going to see Blossom and Granny soon. I talked to the Gen-<lb/>
eral last week and he said if his mother was still feeling ill,<lb/>
as she was for a couple of days, he would have me and his sister<lb/>
out at his house some afternoon, otherwise I should call on them<lb/>
at the hotel.</p>
<p>Taking your suggestion, I went down to Archives, and had quite<lb/>
a busy day going through some material on Reed. It doesn't at<lb/>
all bear out Kelly's implication that he had a tough time getting<lb/>
the army to let him go to Johns Hopkins. I'm going to do further<lb/>
searching and <del><unclear></unclear></del> see if I can find any correspondence between<lb/>
Reed and the SG or Adjutant General that indicates how and under<lb/>
what circumstances he went there. In the correspondence I saw,<lb/>
he asked for 4 months leave in July, <add><unclear>1892</unclear></add> to begin Sept. 1, and got<lb/>
it, so <unclear>tht</unclear> he could study &ldquo;practical medicine and surgery&rdquo; (not<lb/>
bacteriology) at Hopkins. Then on <unclear>Octl</unclear> 1 he asked for a trans-<lb/>
fer to Baltimore, so <unclear>tht</unclear> he could take the full course, and four<lb/>
days later it was granted. That certainly doesn't sound like<lb/>
hard going to me, unless there is something missing which is per-<lb/>
fectly possible, and even likely, according to Mr. <unclear>Todd</unclear>, the man<lb/>
in charge. According to the reports, Reed spent a great part of<lb/>
the summer of 1891 on examining boards, at West Point, Washington<lb/>
and New York. He was in New York all of October and went from<lb/>
there straight to Ft. Snelling, arriving November 7.</p>
<p>It was so nice to see you and Mrs. Hench, <unclear>and</unclear> I am so irked and<lb/>
disappointed that I was out when you called again. I went to see<lb/>
Dr. Howard a few days ago, and he told me that you had been to see<lb/>
him - isn't he old, though. General Kean had to go back to the<lb/>
hospital, but Mrs. Ireland tells me that he is all right again.<lb/>
When I see Mrs. Blossom Reed I shall by all means ask her if I<lb/>
may see the letters she let you copy, although I'm afraid it's<lb/>
a little late to do me much good. It occurs to me to wonder if<lb/>
Lazear's &ldquo;little black notebook&rdquo; could be buried somewhere at<lb/>
Archives. I think I'll poke around a bit and see if I can turn<lb/>
it up.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for coming to see me, and for your good sug-<lb/>
gestions.</p>
<p>Did you know that some medical officer in the Navy is doing a job on Reed, too?<lb/>
Mr. Todd didn't tell me who he is - only that he appears to be esp. interested<lb/>
in his <unclear>Ft. Snelley &amp;</unclear> St. Paul days.</p>
<p>lw.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
