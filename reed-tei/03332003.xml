Dr. S. Goldwater, Commissioner<lb/>
Department of Hospitals<lb/>
New York, New York<lb/>
<salute>My dear Commissioner:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been informed that there is shortly likely to be a vacancy on your<lb/>
staff, and that the name of General A. E. Truby, Medical Department, United States<lb/>
Army, has been suggested to you. In as much as I have known Dr. Truby and his work<lb/>
very well for the past seventeen years, I am presuming to tell you something of him.</p>
<p>In the first place he is an ideal soldier man with all the loyalty to his<lb/>
chief that a successful life in the Army implies. He is a genial, hard working,<lb/>
entirely reliable physician, immensely popular with his associates in the Army, and<lb/>
with a host of friends, chiefly physicians, who have known him either in the Army<lb/>
or in his outside contacts. He has served in the following exceedingly responsible<lb/>
positions: Superintendent of the Ancon Hospital; Chief Health Officer of the Canal<lb/>
Zone; four years as Chief Medical Officer, U. S. Air Service; four years as Command-<lb/>
ing Officer, Letterman General Hospital, San Francisco; two years as Chief Surgeon,<lb/>
Department of the Philippines; two years as Chief Surgeon at Governors Island; two<lb/>
years as the Executive Officer under General Ireland, Surgeon General's Office;<lb/>
from 1932 to the present time Commanding the General Medical Center, including the<lb/>
Walter Reed Hospital, Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>General Truby was born in New York State; he is still a citizen of this<lb/>
State, and throughout his entire service in the Army has looked upon New York as<lb/>
his home. While he has been on duty in the neighborhood of New York he has taken<lb/>
an active part in the professional life outside as well as inside the Army, and he<lb/>
has stood by to promote every medical interest in the profession to such an extent<lb/>
that those of us who know him--and he has a host of friends in the profession--have<lb/>
grown to love him as much as we respect him and his work.</p>
<p>He is what is known in the Army as an &ldquo;easy boss&rdquo; having that rare execu-<lb/>
tive ability which enables him to secure full cooperation, respect and affection<lb/>
from his subordinates. He is a grand person, and I feel that his services would<lb/>
be very useful to you in every way. I know that he would be welcomed most warmly<lb/>
back to his own State by all the doctors who have met him.</p>
<p>Hoping that I am not presuming in this letter, feeling as I do that we<lb/>
all have a rare opportunity to secure for our service a fine gentleman, an execu-<lb/>
tive of outstanding ability, and a physician of the highest possible standard,<lb/>
I am,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
