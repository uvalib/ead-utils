U.S.A.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wish to thank you very much for your<lb/>
kind letter. It was indeed a great pleasure for us to<lb/>
have you and your colleagues at the meeting on Vitamins<lb/>
and nutrition held at Habana.</p>
<p>We had the privilege of having here<lb/>
the most representative members of the United States<lb/>
medicine, which we knew already through their important<lb/>
contributions to the medical science.</p>
<p>I am sending you a copy of the few<lb/>
words of introduction which I read before your paper,<lb/>
whose original I gave Dr. Spies the same day. A friend<lb/>
of mine was kind enough to translate it in English.</p>
<p>With best regards, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours</salute>

<head>Introduction [English translation] for Philip Showalter Hench's presentation at the Conference on Vitamins and Nutrition, by Pedro A. Castillo, 1952</head>
<pb n="2" id="f04420009"/>
<p>It is a great privilege for us this morning to have<lb/>
the opportunity of seeing and hearing one of the outstand-<lb/>
ing representatives of North American medicine today: Dr.<lb/>
Philip S. Hench, Professor of Medicine of the University<lb/>
of Minnesota, Director of Research in the Mayo Clinic and<lb/>
Chief of the Section of Rheumatic Diseases of that Insti-<lb/>
tution.</p>
<p>In obedience to one of the rules of this Conference,<lb/>
I have had to accept the honor of introducing our illustrious<lb/>
visitor to our assembled colleagues; having accepted the<lb/>
honor, however, I decline the mission: Dr. Hench needs no<lb/>
introduction.</p>
<p>He was introduced, not to us but to the entire Universe,<lb/>
as a man of exceptional merits on a Sunday afternoon, Decem-<lb/>
ber 10, 1950, when he received from the hands of His Majesty<lb/>
King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, the Nobel Prize of Physio-<lb/>
logy and Medicine, granted by the Royal Caroline Institute<lb/>
of Medicine and Surgery, together with Edward C. Kendall and<lb/>
Thaddeus Reichstein, &ldquo;for their discoveries in connection with<lb/>
cortico-adrenal hormones; their structure and biological ef-<lb/>
fects&rdquo;. This, indeed, is the highest distinction to which<lb/>
the genius and industry of man in the service of human happi-<lb/>
ness can aspire.</p>
<p>Davisson, the physicist, has said that &ldquo;the Nobel prize<lb/>
winner is transformed overnight from an extremely private ci-<lb/>
tizen into something like a semi-public institution&rdquo;, and Ken-<lb/>
dall adds that if he had received his prize in 1950, with all<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f04420010"/>
-2-<lb/>
the pomp attendant upon the fiftieth anniversary of the<lb/>
foundation of the Nobel Prize, he surely would have left<lb/>
out the semi: the man emerges from the status of a private<lb/>
unit to that of a public Institution as the whole world<lb/>
looks on admiringly and applauds.</p>
<p>Any physician anywhere in the world who has followed<lb/>
the development of medical science in recent years must<lb/>
necessarily have read and pondered over the works of this<lb/>
man, to whom we are indebted for a direct contribution to<lb/>
the study and application of the cortico-adrenal hormones<lb/>
which have revolutionized endocrine physiology and which<lb/>
have so helped suffering humanity in the relief and elimi-<lb/>
nation of pain.</p>
<p>Hench was unquestionably a forerunner of these dis-<lb/>
coveries; intensely devoted to the study of rheumatoid<lb/>
arthritis (formerly called chronic infectious arthritis)<lb/>
and related affections, he pointed out in 1925 that the<lb/>
fatigue, weakness and hypotension common in these patients<lb/>
raised the possibility, in addition to the supposed infec-<lb/>
tious factor, of some metabolic disorder somehow related<lb/>
to the adrenal glands.</p>
<p>Four years later, in 1929, in observing that rheuma-<lb/>
toid arthritis patients usually improved when afflicted with<lb/>
jaundice, he insisted that it was not a fatal and progressive-<lb/>
ly uncontrollable disease, and he suggested the existence in<lb/>
such cases of some beneficial hepatic or biliar agent which<lb/>
for the time being could only be called &ldquo;antirheumatic subs-<lb/>
tance X&rdquo;.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f04420011"/>
<p>-3-</p>
<p>In an article which was published on March 16, 1938,<lb/>
covering research conducted since 1931, he drew attention<lb/>
to the improvement caused by pregnancy in various chronic<lb/>
articular affections, and endeavored to establish some<lb/>
connection with the hypothetical substance X, which might<lb/>
be some bisexual esteroid hormone, whose action was not<lb/>
confined to articular affections but applied as well to<lb/>
other diseases such as asthma, migraine, psoriasis, etc.</p>
<p>In numerous conversations with <unclear>Kendall</unclear> efforts had<lb/>
been made, without success, to identify the supposed subs-<lb/>
tance X, and although the latter had isolated the so-called<lb/>
compound E, now known as Cortisone, from the suprarenal cortex<lb/>
since 1935, the minimum quantities obtained had not been suf-<lb/>
ficient for clinical use.</p>
<p>The cooperative research work of many scientists finally<lb/>
led in 1948 to an accomplishment of formidable scientific<lb/>

proportions and practical application: the use of powerful<lb/>
adrenal hormones, directly injected or stimulated by the<lb/>
pituitary corticotropine.</p>
<p>Now, more than a quarter of a century after having first<lb/>
advanced his theory about the hypothetical substance X, we<lb/>
shall listen with admiration and with special interest to<lb/>
this distinguished investigator, who has labored with such<lb/>
tenacity and persistence in furtherance of his farsighted<lb/>
conception.</p>
