<salute>My dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have taken much<lb/>
more time than was necessary<lb/>
to answer the few questions in<lb/>
the slip which came with your<lb/>
letter of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Things were<lb/>
happening here all last week<lb/>
that took up my time. It was<lb/>
an important week with the<lb/>
T. J. Memorial in which we have<lb/>
finally settled the question of<lb/>
the inscriptions on the walls<lb/>
of the Memorial which we have<lb/>
been debating for over a year<lb/>
and about which I had some<lb/>
very decided notions. Then we<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06307002"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
2<lb/>
have decided the <hi>size</hi> of the heroic<lb/>
statue of T.J. which will stand in<lb/>
the center of the temple. Then<lb/>
there were teas and dinners<lb/>
and visitors and various &ldquo;<hi>must</hi><lb/>
<hi>do</hi>&rdquo;. And when I got out my<lb/>
diaries to find your answers I<lb/>
read on and on, and finally<lb/>
got slips of paper and jotted<lb/>
down other things that I came<lb/>
across which possibly might<lb/>
interest you. I was often inter-<lb/>
rupted, so I would lose my place<lb/>
and my attention would be on<lb/>
other things. Here is the result<lb/>
8 slips. Do what you choose with<lb/>
them. In case you are interested in<lb/>
who are the commissioners of the T.J.M.<lb/>
I have used a sheet of their stationery<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06307003"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
3<lb/>
you will find the names on the back<lb/>
of <del>pages</del><add>slips</add> VI &amp; VII. Truby when I<lb/>
read over the accounts of the delays,<lb/>
refusals and stupidities of of Col. F. S.<lb/>
Humphrey I got mad all over again<lb/>
as I was in the spring of 1899 at the<lb/>
dog-in-the manger behavior of Gen.<lb/>
Humphrey about every thing relating<lb/>
to the Medical Service. He even but<lb/>
lied our chief Q. M. and Post Q. M.<lb/>
at Marianao &amp; the Barracks so<lb/>
that they got to be nearly as bad<lb/>
as he was.</p>
<p><hi>Nov. 3</hi>. I found yesterday afternoon<lb/>
a file of my sanitary reports,<lb/>
routine and special, for 1899 &amp;<lb/>
1900 and spent all the afternoon<lb/>
and evening up to 11.30 pm reading<lb/>
them, they are of course much fuller<lb/>
than my diary especially about the<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06307004"/>
4.<lb/>
sewer. When the barracks were limed over on<lb/>
July 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1899 to Gen. Lee for occupation by the<lb/>
troops the latrines had simply a wheel<lb/>
barrow under each seat but none of the<lb/>
other arrangements and facilities necessary<lb/>
to be provided for a dry earth system on<lb/>
a great scale a large building where<lb/>
the earth could be dried by baking if neces-<lb/>
sary as in the rainy system &amp; pulverized<lb/>
and stored - a large bin in each<lb/>
latine for a stock of clay dust and<lb/>
scoops to handle it and a sewer<lb/>
for the transportation &amp; disposal of<lb/>
the fwces after dusting. There were<lb/>
no pantries and cupboards connected<lb/>
with the kitchens or ice boxes or any place<lb/>
to store food or any screens to protect it<lb/>
from flies. There were 4 pages of important omis-<lb/>
sions listed in the report of the Board of Survey<lb/>
which would have to be remedied before the<lb/>
buildings could be occupied in troops. Gen. Lee<lb/>
stood firm and would not allow their occupation<lb/>
by troops until they were all supplied.</p>

<p>I am afraid that the sewer will seen<lb/>
to you to occupy an undue prominence<lb/>
in my notes, but it was of immense<lb/>
sanitary importance and besides it was<lb/>
a test issue with the Q. M. Dept in Cuba<lb/>
to decide if they should run the sanita-<lb/>
tion and ignore the Med. Dept entirely<lb/>
in these matters. Humphrey started<lb/>
out with the latter idea and we beat<lb/>
him in the end. President Theodore<lb/>
Roosevelt was right in his scathing<lb/>
criticism of Humphrey's inefficiency<lb/>
in the embarkation of Shafters Army<lb/>
at Tampa. It is an extraordinary<lb/>
feat of hypnotism by that slick, clever<lb/>
Irishman Gen. Weston that he persuaded<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06307006"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
6<lb/>
T. R. that it would be an act of wonder-<lb/>
ful magnanimity for him to appoint<lb/>
Col. C. F. Humphrey to be Quarter Master<lb/>
General of the Army. He was a<lb/>
slick bluffer as such, but he had<lb/>
learned to respect the Med. Dept.<lb/>
and we had no trouble with him.<lb/>
