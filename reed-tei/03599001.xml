Dr. A. D. Albertini<lb/>
Director of Finlay Institute<lb/>
Havana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Albertini:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You may remember my visit to Havana in April when I was doing some<lb/>
historical researches on the work of Dr. Finlay and the U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission.<lb/>
You will remember that for certain reasons I felt sure that the government had chosen the<lb/>
wrong site of Camp Lazear and that Mr. Moran and I located the true site on the San Jose<lb/>
farm, still owned by the widow of Dr. Rojas, Dr. Agramonte's friend. You will also remember<lb/>
that His Excellency, Dr. Ramos, asked me to submit to him my evidence in documentary fashion<lb/>
so that they would know where these sites truly were. I have sent to Mr. Moran a prelim-<lb/>
inary memorandum for his correction and there is some additional information which I am<lb/>
anxious to obtain. I would appreciate it greatly if you could give me some help.</p>
<p>When I rewrite my data in better shape I shall be delighted to submit<lb/>
it to you, as I know you will be greatly interested in it. Meanwhile, I shall be grateful<lb/>
for the following information:</p>
<p>Has there ever been written a <hi>pamphlet or booklet on the history</hi> of<lb/>
Las Animas Hospital? and how may I obtain a copy of it?</p>
<p>Have the buildings <hi>been materially changed in</hi> the last forty years?<lb/>
With your kind permission and the help of Dr. Castro, I obtained a photograph of the room<lb/>
in which Miss Maass died and in which, according to the official record, Dr. Lazear was<lb/>
bitten, but I was unable to obtain a photograph of the general group of buildings. Has<lb/>
an <hi>aeroplane photograph or an aeroplane</hi> drawing of the general grounds and buildings ever<lb/>
been made and could I obtain a copy? I am anxious to identify the Las Animas Hospital<lb/>
with the conquest of yellow fever, and wish such a <hi>photograph or drawing not only</hi> for a<lb/>
slide, to be used in my address on the occasion of the forthcoming dedication of the Lazear<lb/>
Memorial <unclear>Building</unclear> at Washington and Jefferson College, but also to be used in publications.</p>
<p>Do you know when the tent Camp Columbia was erected and what was on this<lb/>
site before hand, when it was replaced by the wooden buildings of Columbia Barracks, when<lb/>
these were torn down and when the present Military City was erected? I have been unable to<lb/>
obtain these dates. Do you know of any written history of Columbia Barracks or the Military<lb/>
City?</p>
<p>Can you give me your own opinion as to the true location of Camp<lb/>
Lazear--the experimental camp where the Infected Mosquito Building and Infected Clothing<lb/>
Building were erected. Did you ever personally visit this camp? It was on the San Jose<lb/>
farm and when any volunteer came down with yellow fever, he was immediately moved from this<lb/>
Camp Lazear to a special yellow fever tent hospital near the grounds of the post hospital<lb/>
at Columbia Barracks. It was in this yellow fever tent hospital that you visited Moran<lb/>
and others with experimental yellow fever. Whatever recollections you have on this, I would<lb/>
be most grateful to have. Do you have any old diary or notes of this, of your own?</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03599002"/>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>May I call your attention to the fact that on the sign behind<lb/>
the Military City, near the Military Hospital, that is the sign memorializing the<lb/>
supposed site of Camp Lazear, they have Dr. Lazear's name spelled wrong. It is<lb/>
spelled &ldquo;Jess&rdquo; but should have been spelled &ldquo;Jesse W. Lazear&rdquo;. May I also call your<lb/>
attention to the fact that the sign in the Salle Guiteras at the Las Animas Hospital<lb/>
in the room where Lazear was presumably bitten, his name is again misspelled. There<lb/>
his name is given as Dr. <hi>James</hi> Lazear. On this sign there are two additional errors.<lb/>
It says that he died in the experimental encampment at Marianao. The official record<lb/>
says that he died at the post hospital, Columbia Barracks. You remember that the<lb/>
experimental camp at Marianao was not set up <unclear>until</unclear> after his death, and it was because<lb/>
of his death that it was named after him. On this sign, the date of his death is<lb/>
also given erroneously. Dr. Castro copied this sign for me and according to my<lb/>
notes, the sign says he died September 28. As a matter of fact, he died September 25.</p>
<p>May I in particular, ask you why this sign says &ldquo;in this room<lb/>
was bitten <hi>experimentally</hi> by a mosquito,-----etc.&rdquo; My investigations have revealed<lb/>
that Lazear apparently truly did inoculate himself experimentally and that he was not<lb/>
accidentally bitten as the official record has it. The wording of this sign would make<lb/>
me believe that you may have information on this point and I am most anxious to know<lb/>
whether this is so. Dr. Castro told me that the temporary cardboard sign was to be<lb/>
replaced by bronze tablets. I should appreciate knowing when this will be done, and<lb/>
I sincerely hope that the corrections that I have noted above can be made before this<lb/>
is done.</p>
<p>In the U.S. Army Medical Museum in Washington, I found a photograph<lb/>
of an old model of Columbia Barracks, made by a Cuban in 1900. This model indicates<lb/>
that the Columbia Barracks grounds extended back to the railroad track and for a little<lb/>
ways across the railroad track, with a small bridge thrown across the railroad track.<lb/>
Is this according to your recollection of the grounds at that time?</p>
<p>Do you have any idea where I could obtain copies of old maps or<lb/>
photographs of Columbia Barracks or, particularly, the post-hospital there?</p>
<p>It was indeed a great pleasure for me to meet you and your<lb/>
colleagues, and I sincerely hope that I may have this privilege again. Should you<lb/>
ever plan to visit the Mayo Clinic, I shall be delighted to be your host and guide.<lb/>
I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your great help in this matter and I can<lb/>
assure you that my only interest and purpose in collecting these data is to enhance<lb/>
the glory of all those who played such a glorious part in the conquest of yellow<lb/>
fever. I can assure you that I shall do what I can to correct any erroneous impressions<lb/>
as to the part Dr. Finlay played, and because I am desirous of giving Dr. Finlay<lb/>
greater credit than has been given to him in the United States, I have written to<lb/>
Dr. Dominguez and to Dr. Carlos E. Finlay, asking for whatever help they can give me,<lb/>
in particular for English translations of their manuscripts on the work of Dr. Finlay.<lb/>
Rest assured that before my own papers are published, I shall submit them to you and<lb/>
others concerned so that the true story can be told.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
