<p>MAJOR WALTER REED DEAD</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Virginian Who Traced Spread Of<lb/>
Yellow Fever Passes Away.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch to the Baltimore Sun.]</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 23. -- Major Walter<lb/>
Reed, of the army, one of the best-known<lb/>
bacteriologists in the country, died at 2<lb/>
o'clock this morning at the General Hos-<lb/>
pital of the army at the Washington Bar-<lb/>
racks, following an operation on Monday<lb/>
last for appendicitis.</p>
<p>He attained international fame recently<lb/>
by discovering that mosquitoes carry the<lb/>
germ of yellow fever. On account of his<lb/>
scientific achievements he was this year<lb/>
awarded an honorary degree by Harvard.</p>
<p>The funeral will take place Tuesday aft-<lb/>
ernoon from St. Thomas' Protestant Epis-<lb/>
copal Church.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A Native Of Virginia.</p>
<p>Major Walter Reed was a Virginian,<lb/>
having been born in Gloucester county in<lb/>
1851. He was a graduate of the medical<lb/>
department of the University of Virginia<lb/>
and of Bellevue Hospital, New York city.<lb/>
Major Reed was appointed an assistant<lb/>
surgeon in the army in 1875, and at the<lb/>
time of his death was first on the list of<lb/>
majors and surgeons in the medical depart-<lb/>
ment of the army. In 1893 he was ap-<lb/>
pointed curator of the Army Medical Mu-<lb/>
seum in Washington, and gave his time to<lb/>
the science which he loved. Combining in<lb/>
an unusual degree scientific accuracy with<lb/>
calm judgment, his ability was invaluable<lb/>
in searching out the cases of epidemic dis-<lb/>
eases and tracing their progress.</p>
<p>During the Spanish-American War he<lb/>
was a member of the board to investigate<lb/>
typhoid fever in the army. After the war<lb/>
he made several voyages to Cuba and was<lb/>
on duty in Havana, studying the diseases<lb/>
of the island, more particularly yellow fe-<lb/>
ver, as a member of the board to investi-<lb/>
gate yellow fever. After a series of bril-<lb/>
liant experiments, which cost the life of<lb/>
one member of the board early in <unclear>1900</unclear> it<lb/>
was announced as a proved fact that yel-<lb/>
low fever is conveyed by a certain variety<lb/>
of mosquito and introduced into the blood<lb/>
of non-immunes by its bite.</p>
<p>Sanitary measures tending to the de-<lb/>
struction of the insect and the screening<lb/>
of infected persons were put into effect<lb/>
immediately in Havana by order of Gen-<lb/>
eral Wood, with the result that for more<lb/>
than a year no case of yellow fever has<lb/>
there developed, though the disease had<lb/>
existed permanently in Havana for three<lb/>
centuries.</p>
<p>Major Reed leaves a widow and a daugh-<lb/>
ter residing in Washington, and a son,<lb/>
Lieut. W. L. Reed, Tenth Infantry, now<lb/>
in the Philippines.</p>
