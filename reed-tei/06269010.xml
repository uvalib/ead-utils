<salute>My dear Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have read over your review with very great interest.<lb/>
On examination of the annual reports of General Ludlow and<lb/>
General Wood, I find that General Gorgas was Chief Surgeon of<lb/>
the Department of Havana until that Department was abolished<lb/>
on April 30th, 1900. Major Davis was Chief Sanitary Officer<lb/>
of the Department of Havana until February, 1900, when he was<lb/>
transferred to Manilla. General Gorgas then succeeded him as<lb/>
Chief Sanitary Officer of the Department. On May 1st, 1900,<lb/>
General Gorgas became Chief Sanitary Officer of the Department<lb/>
of Cuba. Colonel Havard was Chief Surgeon of the Department<lb/>
of Cuba, and in so far as I can ascertain, remained in that<lb/>
position until the close of the intervention. I do not see<lb/>
that General Gorgas ever was Chief Surgeon.</p>
<p>I also think that you were wrong in stating that<lb/>
General Ludlow did not support, and was not a friend of General<lb/>
Gorgas. I knew General Ludlow very intimately, as you know, and<lb/>
I don't remember any instance or statement which would warrant<lb/>
your statement that he was not friendly to General Gorgas. It<lb/>
is quite possible that General Gorgas himself may have felt un-<lb/>
friendly to General Ludlow, but I do not think the reverse is<lb/>
the case. I don't know anything about relations of the other<lb/>
chiefs whom you mention to General Gorgas.</p>
<p>In regard to the cleaning of Havana. I think you can<lb/>
make the statement stronger than you have. Havana was cleaned<lb/>
in a physical sense, both as to streets and buildings, before<lb/>
General Gorgas became Chief Sanitary Officer. After he became<lb/>
Chief Sanitary Officer, he continued Dr. Davis' work in keeping<lb/>
the private houses cleaned, and he should be credited with the<lb/>
entire work of freeing the city from mosquitoes.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading your review of the book very much, and<lb/>
believe that you have done full justice to the subject, with the<lb/>
exceptions noted above.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
