<title>Letter from Frederick F. Russell to Laura Armistead Carter, October 18, 1927</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Russell suggests Carter consider working part-time on the editing of the History of Yellow Fever in order to preserve her strength and make her labors more rewarding.  He also mentions that his work in West Africa is proving Henry Rose Carter's theory that yellow fever developed in Africa and spread into the New World.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In making our plans for the year 1928 I have given<lb/>
considerable thought to the <hi>History of Yellow Fever</hi>, and in<lb/>
view of the difficult time you have had with your health dur-<lb/>
ing the past year, I should like to suggest that instead of<lb/>
undertaking to work steadily on this work, as you have in the<lb/>
past, that you consider making it a part-time effort, giving<lb/>
not more than half of each day to such work. This will pre-<lb/>
vent your getting tired and will not make any undue demand on<lb/>
your physical strength, and in the end perhaps you will be able<lb/>
to finish the work you are doing with greater pleasure and sat-<lb/>
isfaction to yourself than if you tried to work at it too vigor-<lb/>
ously. I should like to suggest, therefore, that instead of<lb/>
the arrangement which we had last year, which was a full-time<lb/>
arrangement for such months as you worked, that we consider for<lb/>
1928 half a day's work for which we would send you $150. per<lb/>
month for as long as was necessary to complete the things which<lb/>
you and Dr. Frost have agreed upon.</p>
<p>Please write me how such a plan might appeal to you.<lb/>
I imagine that you will do a great deal of your work in Washing-<lb/>
ton, and I look forward to seeing you either there or in Baltimore<lb/>

October 18, 1927.<lb/>
when I go down in the spring.</p>
<p>Our work in West Africa is going very well and al-<lb/>
though the time has not come to publish the work, I hope that<lb/>
it will soon be so far advanced that the men can publish their<lb/>
reports. We have had many unexpected things happen in<lb/>
yellow fever work and the day is not over for such things, and<lb/>
until everybody is substantially agreed upon results it would<lb/>
scarcely be worth while to publish. I may say, however, to<lb/>
you that everything which has developed in West Africa tends<lb/>
to confirm your father's opinion that the disease came origin-<lb/>
ally out of Africa and spread secondly into the new world. Of<lb/>
course, it is too early to make public any such statement but<lb/>
the tendency of the work is in this direction.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
