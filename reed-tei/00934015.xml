<salute>Dear Doctor Carter;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your letter July 5th. after it had been forwarded<lb/>
from both N.Y. and Vera Cruz.</p>
<p>I have the percentage of house breeding down now to<lb/>
about 3 and there it remains- at times it drops to 2 1/2<lb/>
but not to stay. The town is putting in a new water system<lb/>
which will fix things permanently I think- many of the<lb/>
people either buy water or carry it long distances now<lb/>
and are loathe to parting with it. Another factor keeping<lb/>
up the rate is the rain - the rainy season started in<lb/>
April and has been very heavy at times, as a result we<lb/>
are finding breeders in all sorts of places in the patios-<lb/>
in old cocoanut shells, holes in tree's and the like.<lb/>
I remember you cautioned in one of your articles about<lb/>
holes in tree trunks, banana tree's and the like as<lb/>
possible breeding places. Driving them out of the houses<lb/>
forces them naturally to these other places. Our gutter<lb/>
problem has caused very little trouble here, one reason<lb/>
and possibly the chief, being the water is too hot - at<lb/>
times it is nearly warm enough to cook an egg - however<lb/>
I caution our inspectors to take nothing for granted<lb/>
but to inspect them anyway.</p>

<p>I shall attempt to answer your questions-</p>
<p>1. <unclear>You</unclear> ask about the breeding in <unclear>wells-</unclear><lb/>
We drop a bucket to the bottom of the well, allow it to<lb/>
remain for three to five minutes and then suddenly pull<lb/>
it up the side and if they are there we find them usually.<lb/>
Many of the wells would have both swarms of stegomyias (adults)<lb/>
as well as the larvae - I have seen some of the buckets just<lb/>
black with larvae (stegomyia). I mean of course the water in<lb/>
the bucket and frequently here we find the stegomya in<lb/>
association with a brown culex which I think is the pipiens.</p>
<p>2. The width of the wells is about four feet on the <unclear>average</unclear><lb/>
some wider.</p>
<p>I do not know the temperature of water. I do know that<lb/>
during March, April and May it is not very cold for nearly<lb/>
all the wells are open to the sun and this is one of <unclear>the</unclear><lb/>
hottest places I was ever in. I have not been able to get<lb/>
a thermometer in town to try out the water but hope <unclear>to</unclear><lb/>
do so later and will try give you an idea as to the <unclear>probable</unclear><lb/>
temperature- this town has very little in way of the most<lb/>
ordinary every day appliances.</p>
<p>3. The fish in wells we can see at times when the light is<lb/>
right - the people as a rule are very proud of their fish<lb/>
and at once inform us if everything is not alright - should<lb/>
the fish die they ask for more since now they realize what<lb/>
their presence means - once in awhile they bring them up<lb/>
in a bucket of water. <del><unclear>I</unclear></del> I am not using bottom <unclear>feedess</unclear><lb/>
since I have to use what I can get and my regular supply<lb/>

____<lb/>
3. OFICINA EN TAPACHULA, CHIAPAS.<lb/>
APARTADO 42.<lb/>
____<lb/>
<unclear>consists</unclear> of pupos, mojarritos, sardinas, truchas and another<lb/>
variety unclassified but a very good one since it is very<lb/>
greedy and feeds top, bottom and the middle - in fact on<lb/>
testing them out I find the pupos <unclear>or</unclear> truchas are very good<lb/>
and provided they are not fed will eat top, bottom and middle.<lb/>
We caution our people about feeding them - they (the people)<lb/>
feel they should feed them but we tell them no and as <del><unclear></unclear></del><lb/>
a result the wells have been cleared of breeding in short<lb/>
order - of course another factor has entered in now, <del><unclear></unclear></del> the<lb/>
cooler weather, no doubt that is helping us.</p>
<p>I am sending some specimens of fish to the Board for<lb/>
classification - the local people can give me no reliable<lb/>
information except that they are fish.</p>
<p>I did not know how Dr. White found out my address - thank you<lb/>
for informing him. I was in North Dakota attempting to help<lb/>
<unclear>reorganize</unclear> the State Board of Health and the temperature was<lb/>
running about 20 below- had been there only three months.<lb/>
Please tell Miss. Carter that we shall more than appreciate<lb/>
her book also please tell her I had not forgotten her promise.<lb/>
Mrs. Scannell is at the cottage - Passetemps Cottage, Bridgewater,<lb/>
New Hampshire. We usually spend the summer there, at least when I<lb/>
am up. The &ldquo;Songs of the Long Trail&rdquo; sounds like Panama.</p>
<p>Please extend my kindest regards to all the members of your<lb/>
family. I expect to see Dr. White in the next few days since<lb/>
some mail arrived here to-day for him, so evidently he is near by.</p>
