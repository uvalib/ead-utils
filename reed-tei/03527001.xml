FROM GUST LAMBERT<lb/>
<salute>Dear Friend Lambert:</salute>
</opener>
<p>As is usually the case, I did not realize that so much time<lb/>
had elapsed since I received your last letter. I find<lb/>
that you wrote it October fifth and that you enclosed a page<lb/>
from the encampment proceedings of the Spanish War Vets.,<lb/>
which you asked me to return.</p>
<p>Am sending it back with this and am sorry that it has taken<lb/>
so long to comply with your request. Our friend Kissin-<lb/>
ger certainly does continue to cash in on his yellow fever<lb/>
experience. Should think his <hi>professional heroism</hi> would<lb/>
make him feel rather cheap when he meets any of the gang who<lb/>
knows the entire story - IF he ever does.</p>
<p>You say, in your last letter, that you are feeling much bet-<lb/>
ter and that your legs are behaving more as legs should.<lb/>
I earnestly hope that the improvement will have continued so<lb/>
that you are your, old self again.</p>
<p>Had a letter from Schwieger a few days ago but will not tell<lb/>
you anything about what he had to say as you probably see<lb/>
him quite often and know a lot more than I could tell you.</p>
<p>You will recall that, some time ago, I wrote Moran, at your<lb/>
suggestion, asking if he would make a affidavit for you.<lb/>
I had a reply from him - about which I wrote you. I wrote<lb/>
him a second time, taking exception to some of his conclu-<lb/>
sions. This must have made the lad sore as I have not<lb/>
heard from him since and, before that, I had been hearing<lb/>
from him quite often. It's funny that some people cannot<lb/>
bear to have anyone disagree with them.</p>
<p>It will be eight years, the first of March, since I went to<lb/>
bed. A few weeks ago I began to, slowly, lose the use of<lb/>
my right hand. It progressed to a point where it was very<lb/>
difficult for me to feed myself or to shave. My right<lb/>
foot was also affected but this was not so annoying as loss<lb/>
of use of the hand.</p>
<p>Then I got a new mattress and all that trouble, slowly, cleared<lb/>
up so that I am almost back to normal again.</p>
<p>Other than that we have all been as well as usual except for<lb/>
minor colds, etc.</p>
<p>Mrs. Andrus joins me in sending kindest regards to Mrs. Lambert<lb/>
and yourself.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>Andrus</signed>
