<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have received your letter of August I4th and appreciate very<lb/>
much your desire to have more details about my book; I beg you to ex-<lb/>
cuse me for not having answered you any sooner.</p>
<p>My book has been translated into English and Spanish, I have the<lb/>
prices and conditions from an American firm, but the wordly situation<lb/>
has prevented it from beeing printed as I so much wished.</p>
<p>Finlay's discovery haw been almost unbeleived for twenty years, on-<lb/>
ly a few French and German men of science had known the value of it, a<lb/>
and when the American Military Board came to Havana with Dr. Reed<lb/>
all the most trascendent problems concerning yellow fever had been<lb/>
solved; for instance, the mosquito had been chosen out as the only<lb/>
transmitter, the <del><unclear>works</unclear></del> proofs of the transmission had been done, the<lb/>
mosquito's life studied, the female pointed out as the only one to tra-<lb/>
nsmit the disease, the works on vaccination and serotherapy done, etc.,<lb/>
you will find all these details in my book.</p>
<p>But the most important fact is the study made by Dr. Finlay on the<lb/>
mild forms of the disease, from which he made his statistics; these<lb/>
statistics have not been accepted by the American Board because they<lb/>
had not presented any clasical type of yellow fever.</p>
<p>Actually, all the data presented by Finlay have been scientifically<lb/>
confirmed and, nowadays, in medical science, we must admit that yellow<lb/>
fever in its most frequent endemical form, was a mild and inapparent<lb/>

Dr Philip S. Hench...<lb/>
MENDOZA Y GUTIERREZ<lb/>

HABANA<lb/>
type able to inmunize the patiente suffering from the attack.</p>
<p>That is why the natives of the places where the yellow fever was en-<lb/>
demical were exempted because they had suffered the disease in their<lb/>
childhood. The other type, serious, sometimes mortal which occured chiefly<lb/>
during the season of greatest heat because then the virulence of the<lb/>
mosquito was greater, can be considered as a mere accident within the<lb/>
endemical state.</p>
<p>Experience has taught us the importance of Finlay's works, and I who<lb/>
have lived with him can affirm that he was a genius.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll who had been bi<unclear><add>tt</add></unclear>en by a mosquito sought for the parasite<lb/>
of paludism in his blood; Dr. Lazear who had made experiments without<lb/>
results, allowed an infected mosquito bite him at the hospital in spite<lb/>
of the warning of his companions, and paid his inexperience with his life<lb/>
however, he knew the value of the mosquito for he had worked with Dr.<lb/>
Grassy in Italy before coming to Cuba.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Reed was in Washington finishing his work on typhoid<lb/>
fever which he had started as a member of the Whitmann Board. Therefore<lb/>
it is a mistake to beleive that Dr. Reed was the author of the disco-<lb/>
very.</p>
<p>The first experimental case of inoc<unclear><add>c</add></unclear>ulation by the mosquito was made<lb/>
by Drs Lazear and Agramonte upon the soldier Dean, and it proved right<lb/>
the theory of Finlay. General Leonard Wood, Governor General of Cuba and<lb/>
himself a surgeon, informed his government of it. You will find all this<lb/>
in the first pages of my book.</p>
<p>I should like to hear from your works <unclear>.and</unclear> remain, dear Dr. Hench.</p>
