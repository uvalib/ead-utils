<salute>Miss Emilie,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Just as I was step-<lb/>
ping on the cars at Blacks<lb/>
&amp; Whites, on my way to Harris-<lb/>
onburg, your letter was han-<lb/>
ded to me. A moment later the<lb/>
train was rattling along at a<lb/>
lively rate; but <del>with</del> all its<lb/>
noise &amp; jar was only a feeble<lb/>
expression of the &ldquo;commotion of<lb/>
Emotions&rdquo; in my own breast.<lb/>
We had gone several miles, e're<lb/>
I opened the envelope. What did<lb/>
it contain? Within its simple<lb/>
folds were there words that, like<lb/>
fresh zephyrs, would bear<lb/>
my spirit Heavenward, or<lb/>
should I find nought but<lb/>
cold, cheerless words, &ldquo;such<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01621002"/>
as crush the life from out<lb/>
young hearts&rdquo;? These were<lb/>
the questions that I asked myself.<lb/>
But lo!, when opened, it contained<lb/>
not the one nor the other! And yet<lb/>
its message was dear to my<lb/>
heart, since it was one of<lb/>
truth &amp; wisdom. Had you been<lb/>
daily expecting such a letter,<lb/>
as mine was, &amp; had you <unclear>an</unclear><lb/>
hundred times revolved its<lb/>
contents <add>over</add> in your mind, you<lb/>
could not have<del>n</del> chosen thoughts<lb/>
that would receive more surely<lb/>
my admiration and approbation.<lb/>
Did I tell you in my last letter<lb/>
that I <hi>loved</hi> you? This one<lb/>
shall repeat it a thousand<lb/>
times. Would to Heaven it could<lb/>
find an echo in your own<lb/>
heart, whose &ldquo;portals are<lb/>
closed&rdquo; against me! My only<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01621003"/>
prayer is that, e're another sun<lb/>
shall sink into the sea,<lb/>
you may find its &ldquo;Key turned&rdquo;.<lb/>
Repressing my feelings, for the<lb/>
moment, permit me to speak<lb/>
a few plain words. You say,<lb/>
&ldquo;the question that you lay bare<lb/>
to me is one that claims se-<lb/>
rious reflection.&rdquo; Most emphat-<lb/>
tically does it require &ldquo;serious<lb/>
reflection,&rdquo; and you may be<lb/>
surprised to learn that it<lb/>
is one to which I have giv-<lb/>
en my thoughts, daily, for<lb/>
many months past. It was not<lb/>
the impulse of the moment that<lb/>
caused me to tell you of my<lb/>
love. No! no!- Had such been<lb/>
the case, you would have known<lb/>
it much sooner.</p>
<p>Consider, Miss Emilie, that I<lb/>
am almost 24 years of age;<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01621004"/>
that during the past 6 years I<lb/>
have seen something of the<lb/>
affection which men &amp; women<lb/>
bear toward one another: (God<lb/>
Knows, I must confess that I<lb/>
have witnessed its absence of-<lb/>
tener than its pres<del>c</del>ence;) that<lb/>
during these years I have given<lb/>
much thought to this subject;<lb/>
that, living in the largest city<lb/>
in America, I have seen &amp; met<lb/>
the most fascinating women;<lb/>
and yet need I tell you that<lb/>
you, &amp; <hi>you alone</hi>, are the only<lb/>
woman whom I have admired!<lb/>
You say; &ldquo;Still some, yea many,<lb/>
but ask it (woman's love) to<lb/>
soon scorn it.&rdquo; Too true! Too<lb/>
true!! But can you believe<lb/>
that I ask <hi>your love</hi> for no<lb/>
other <del>love</del> <add>reason</add> than simply that I<lb/>
may <hi>scorn</hi> it? Could I but<lb/>
see you for one hour- I know<lb/>
that I could convince you of<lb/>
my sincerity. Why, Miss Emilie,<lb/>
the thought that most oppres-<lb/>
ses me, that binds my tongue,<lb/>
is the thought that I am utterly<lb/>
unworthy of your love, nor<lb/>
that I even can be worthy of it,<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01621005"/>
Whatever honors the future<lb/>
should confer upon me.<lb/>
I cannot invite you to luxury's<lb/>
lap; to riches, nor to honors. I<lb/>
can only invite you to a heart<lb/>
as true to its word as is the<lb/>
needle to the pole! For the<lb/>
former I care but little; I<lb/>
only desire that my lot may<lb/>
be cast where I can find<lb/>
some rest &amp; &ldquo;gather bliss<lb/>
to see my fellows blessed.&rdquo;<lb/>
You exclaim; &ldquo;there is no<lb/>
c<add>h</add>rystal purer than the affection<lb/>
which she <hi>can</hi> bestow.&rdquo; This I<lb/>
cannot deny. Often have I seen<lb/>
it as &ldquo;pure as the chrystal&rdquo;<lb/>
&amp; yet trampelled under foot!<lb/>
Often have I, at such times,<lb/>
thought, oh! could <hi>I</hi> but show<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01621006"/>
some woman <del>what</del> how great<lb/>
affection <hi>man</hi> can bestow!<lb/>
If <hi>her's</hi> is the chrystal, <hi>mine</hi><lb/>
should be the <hi>Sun</hi> to bring<lb/>
to light its hidden defects!<lb/>
For what were a chrystal<lb/>
without the Sun? What were<lb/>
the tenderness of <hi>woman's</hi> love<lb/>
without the protection of<lb/>
<hi>man's</hi> love?</p>
<p>You quote the words of the<lb/>
Arrowsmith &amp; you partic-<lb/>
ularly emphasize &ldquo;<hi>leaving all<lb/>
things for the stranger</hi>,&rdquo; and<lb/>
add, &ldquo;how often are we dis-<lb/>
appointed in human nature<lb/>
and discover, <hi>too late</hi>, that<lb/>
we know them not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I am com-<lb/>
paratively a stranger to you<lb/>
and that you <add>know</add> but little of my<lb/>
disposition &amp; character. But<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01621007"/>
there is such a thing as <add>your</add> <del>my</del><lb/>
becoming better acquainted<lb/>
with me &amp; there is an abun-<lb/>
dance of time for this.<lb/>
However happy &amp; proud I<lb/>
would be, did I know that you<lb/>
had some affection for me,<lb/>
and though life's burden would<lb/>
be lighter, did I know that there<lb/>
was a heart <del>that</del> would rejoice<lb/>
at my success or console me<lb/>
in my reverses; that there was<lb/>
&ldquo;an eye would mark my com-<lb/>
ing &amp; grow brighter when I<lb/>
came&rdquo;; still if it seem good<lb/>
and proper, according to your<lb/>
best judgement, to prescribe<lb/>
certain conditions, or to make<lb/>
certain requests, whereby I<lb/>
may show to you may <hi>entire</hi><lb/>
sincerity, you have but<lb/>
to say the word &amp; then judge<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01621008"/>
according to my deserts-<lb/>
I have been earnest &amp; deter-<lb/>
mined in some things during<lb/>
my past years &amp; I am deter-<lb/>
mined in this: that I may con-<lb/>
vince you, above the sh<add>a</add>dow of<lb/>
doubt, that I bear to you the<lb/>
purest affection, and to win<lb/>
your love, if it be possible.<lb/>
And, above all, I desire to<lb/>
do this with an <hi>open heart</hi> &amp;<lb/>
<hi>Countenance</hi>! There is nothing<lb/>
that I would not disclose<lb/>
to your most searching exam-<lb/>
ination, since to purposely<lb/>
deceive a person whom we<lb/>
love is, to me, the height of<lb/>
repulsiveness- I trust that<lb/>
I may soon hear from you<lb/>
&amp; may I hear &ldquo;better things&rdquo;!<lb/>
My mother desires me to send<lb/>
her best love to you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>I remain, as ever,<lb/>
your true friend,</salute>
<signed>Walter Reed</signed>.
