Assistant Surgeon General H. R. Carter,<lb/>
2121 California Street, N. W.,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>To-days mail was one of the few worth awhile<lb/>
receiving, for as a wonderful and welcome surprise, I<lb/>
received your thoughtful letter and very much appreciated<lb/>
articles on yellow fever - I shall read your writing with<lb/>
great interest and no less profit I am sure and shall<lb/>
return it only when I have memorized a good deal of it.<lb/>
What may be of greater interest to you, than the reported<lb/>
yellow fever case from Paramaribo are the two cases of<lb/>
&ldquo;something&rdquo; that during the latter part of October, I took<lb/>
off one of the best ships that fly the American flag. I am<lb/>
simply stuck, Dr. Carter, and I need your advice badly.<lb/>
I take the liberty to enclose a part of the histories and<lb/>
graphic charts of the cases together with a summary of the<lb/>
laboratory findings, which I wish you would consider and<lb/>
advise me. I am still wondering whether we have yellow<lb/>
fever or estivo autumnal malaria or both, as I am inclined<lb/>
to believe, in each instance. Shortly after the admission<lb/>
of the patients, I asked two Mobile Doctors to see the cases<lb/>
and they both agreed with me, that the patients were both<lb/>
yellow fever. Then the continued search of blood smears<lb/>
revealed the malaria parasites in Chancy's case. A short<lb/>
time ago, Adie had a typical malarial attack save the chill<lb/>
prior to each febrile paroxim, which is understood however.<lb/>
I fully appreciate the sanitary importance in reaching a<lb/>
correct diagnosis in these cases, hence your opinion most<lb/>
desirable. To be sure that no error has been made on my<lb/>
part, I am also sending you part of the blood slides taken,<lb/>
which I wish you would have examined and check me up.</p>
<p>I am not trying to pose as a finish laboratory<lb/>
technician, and if I have slipped up on something, it will<lb/>
be to my advantage to know it as it is to the Service<lb/>
interest to know exactly what we are dealing with. If you<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01003036"/>
11/17-22<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>
should find it practicable to discuss the subject with<lb/>
Dr. Long of the Quarantine Division, other reported facts<lb/>
may come to light, as I have made an effort to keep the<lb/>
Bureau fully informed of circumstances, as I see them.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate indeed, that I have not all<lb/>
the clinical data prepared for typing, but should you want<lb/>
to review the entire histories, please advise me as I expect<lb/>
to have these up to date by the time I would hear from you.</p>
<p>Thanking you in advance for the trouble I am<lb/>
about to put you to, and assuring you of my appreciation<lb/>
for your courtesy, I shall close.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to yourself and daughter,<lb/>
from me and mine, I am,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>M. S. Lombard,<lb/>
Surgeon, U.S.P.H.S.</signed>
<seg>
P. S. I just received orders for the U. S. Marine Hospital No.5<lb/>
Chicago Ill. I have not lost interest in these cases so<lb/>
please let me hear from you. I expect to leave shortly<lb/>
