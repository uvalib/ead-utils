<salute>Dear Dr Hench,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Sorry to bother you, but I think<lb/>
that the inclosed <xref id="f06501106">letter</xref> from Gust Lambert with<lb/>
my <xref id="f06501101">answer</xref> is important and that you<lb/>
should have it in your files-</p>
<p>Notice that his letter was supposed to<lb/>
come from Birmingham, Ala. but it was<lb/>
post marked in Chicago. Evidently Lambert<lb/>
is beginning another drive to get on the<lb/>
Roll of Honor and now seems to have both<lb/>
funds &amp; some brains behind his efforts-<lb/>
Notice his extensive trip through the south<lb/>
including Cuba. Also note that parts of the<lb/>
letter are somewhat <unclear>garbled</unclear> in the L. style,<lb/>
because the person who prepared the letter could<lb/>
not quite get the exact ideas L. wanted to<lb/>
express- I am quite sure that <del><unclear>men</unclear></del> no<lb/>
men were innoculated with infected mosquitoes<lb/>
at the y. f. Hospital, as that would <del><unclear>not</unclear></del> have<lb/>
ruined the value of the experiment. Mosquitoes<lb/>
were probably placed on y. f. patients <add>there</add> in order<lb/>
to <unclear>infect</unclear> the insects and then those mosquitoes<lb/>
were taken to Camp Lazear where they were,<lb/>
at the proper time, placed on the volunteers<lb/>
who were there in quarantine waiting to be<lb/>
given the test-</p>
<p>The first sentence of par 2 probably refers<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06501105"/>
Tr<lb/>
to something Ames did after he left Cuba.<lb/>
Gen Kean once told me that Ames had done<lb/>
a criminal stunt of that kind at some<lb/>
place in the South after Ames had left<lb/>
Cuba. I do not know the details but Kean<lb/>
thought it so bad that Ames should have<lb/>
been prosecuted- Possibly you have heard<lb/>
the same story from Kean.</p>
<p>You will remember that I wrote Lambert<lb/>
that I would not discuss the y. f. episode<lb/>
with him any further. That was in 1944.<lb/>
So, when this letter came I was inclined<lb/>
to ignore it. But after careful consideration<lb/>
I decided that the best policy would be to<lb/>
write him a firm, but courteous letter expressing<lb/>
my views and conclusions. I have not<lb/>
sent a copy to Gen. Kean for I do not want to<lb/>
worry him as he may be very feeble- As<lb/>
I think you &amp; Kean have some sort of working<lb/>
arrangement, probably with the S. S. O., to protect<lb/>
the Roll of Honor from attacks of this kind, I<lb/>
feel that you will know best what to do<lb/>
with this matter-</p>
<p>We are all looking forward to seeing you<lb/>
&amp; Mrs Hench in June at the S. F. <unclear>a. m. a.</unclear> meeting<lb/>
Hope you are fine and that you are<lb/>
able to find a reasonable amount of time<lb/>
for rest and recreation.</p>
<p>With all good wishes</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very Sincerely</salute>
