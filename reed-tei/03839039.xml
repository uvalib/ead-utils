<salute>Dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Many thanks for your letter of November 22nd with the Reprint of<lb/>
your address at the unveiling of Cornwell's painting.</p>
<p>There are some points in your address with which I disagree. One is<lb/>
the repeated statement <add>that</add> my father did not produce a single case of experi-<lb/>
mental yellow fever, based mostly on the length of the so-called &ldquo;external<lb/>
incubation&rdquo; which was supposed to require twelve days but which recent<lb/>
work by the Rockefeller workers have confirmed to vary from 4 to 18 days<lb/>
according to the outside temperature, time required for the virus to reach<lb/>
the salivary glands and in the mosquito to be infective through the bite,<lb/>
whereas if the mosquito be crushed and its contents injected it is found<lb/>
infective from the moment of its ingestion, destroying the phallacy that<lb/>
that the supposed parasite of yellow fever had to spend a phase of its<lb/>
existence in the body of the mosquito like that of malaria. Another is<lb/>
your version of Lazear's inoculation which is at variance not only with<lb/>
the official account but with the account written by Agramonte to my father;<lb/>
it also presupposes ethics in his co-officers at loggerheads with those<lb/>
we have always been proud to consider in connection with the U.S.A. and<lb/>
whollly unnecessary as life insurances are payable even in cases of delibe-<lb/>
rate suicide once a certain length of time has ellapsed, Lazear is known to<lb/>
have received a negative inoculation some time prior to the time of his<lb/>
last infection and to have made several inoculation experiments unknown<lb/>
to the remainder of the commission, two of which according to Agramonte<lb/>

2<lb/>
were positive, the details of which may possibly have existed in the<lb/>
notes found in his little notebook. The importance of Lazear's case<lb/>
according to the official report is that it was evidently produced<lb/>
by a shortly incubated mosquito found within the net from which he was<lb/>
collecting mosquito for future experimental work.</p>
<p>Wishing you the best success in your efforts to raise money for<lb/>
the purchase of the San Jose farm and for a coming Happy New Year</p>
