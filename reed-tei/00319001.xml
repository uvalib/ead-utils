<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been busy<lb/>
all this week but Dr. Reed leaves<lb/>
today so I shall have it a<lb/>
little lighter for a while. It has<lb/>
been rather warm but one feels<lb/>
all right if one does not<lb/>
exercise hard in the middle of the<lb/>
day. We visited Morro Castle and<lb/>
Caba&ntilde;as yesterday. They are old<lb/>
fortresses like the one at St. Augustine<lb/>
except much larger. I was much<lb/>
surprised at the size of Caba&ntilde;as <del><unclear>It</unclear></del><lb/>
I think it has more rooms in it<lb/>
than any building I have ever seen.</p>
<p>The Spaniards have quartered 10 000 troops<lb/>
there. At present it is not used<lb/>
at all owing to the danger of<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00319002"/>
Yellow Fever. It is situated directly<lb/>
across the harbor from Havana.</p>
<p>The Spaniards used it also as a<lb/>
prison and there are numerous<lb/>
horrible dungeons under it.</p>
<p>In the moat is a place where<lb/>
they shot the prisoners.<lb/>
Along the wall there is a<lb/>
black line about four feet from<lb/>
the ground which was used<lb/>
as a guide to the soldiers in<lb/>
taking aim.</p>
<p>The baby is doing very well<lb/>
now. For some reason the<lb/>
fleas suddenly disappeared and<lb/>
consequently he sleeps much<lb/>
better. He received your<lb/>
letter and will probably be able<lb/>
to understand it some day.<lb/>
He has not yet spoken a word,<lb/>
but he thinks he can talk and<lb/>
makes lots of noise that seems<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00319003"/>
to give him great satisfaction.<lb/>
He is out of doors almost<lb/>
all the time. We have a nice<lb/>
porch with a railing and<lb/>
he stays there when not<lb/>
off in his carriage.</p>
<p>We enjoyed the &ldquo;Bookman&rdquo; you<lb/>
sent very much. I hope you<lb/>
will send some more, but not<lb/>
until you have finished reading<lb/>
them.</p>
<p>I have not heard a word from<lb/>
Pittsburgh since I came here.<lb/>
The rents of course are being saved<lb/>
to pay taxes which fall due<lb/>
in April so there was not<lb/>
much to write about,</p>
<p>The house on Denniston Ave<lb/>
will be vacant after Apr 1.<lb/>
unless a new tenant is secured.<lb/>
They are advertising. I am not sorry<lb/>
that the present tenant is leaving<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00319004"/>
Like most preachers, he was<lb/>
more nuisance than anything<lb/>
else. It is rather amusing<lb/>
to see the treatment of the<lb/>
Chaplain here. a Presbyterian<lb/>
minister. No one seems to<lb/>
want him around. He has been<lb/>
refused admission to most<lb/>
of the messes.</p>
<p>I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your affectionate Son</salute>
I have just heard from the Brandts.<lb/>
They say that the Halls want to keep the<lb/>
house until May 1 and that they think<lb/>
they have a man who will take it<lb/>
unfurnished from that time. Consequently<lb/>
nothing need be done at present and Mabel<lb/>
will probably be on hand at the time<lb/>
the furniture is to be taken out-<lb/>
