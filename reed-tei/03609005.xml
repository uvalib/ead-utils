Dr. J. E. Peabody<lb/>
281 Lowell Ave.<lb/>
Newtonville, Massachusetts<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Peabody:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your sending me your pamphlet<lb/>
&ldquo;The Conquest of Yellow Fever&rdquo; and the additional notes. I have collected quite<lb/>
a lot of new stuff. You will be interested to know that I found that Lazear<lb/>
secretly had himself bitten deliberately and died of true experimental yellow fever.<lb/>
I hope to announce my facts on the occasion of the dedication of the Lazear<lb/>
Memorial Building at Washington and Jefferson College, Washington, Pa., October 26.</p>
<p>I also found while I was in Cuba that the government had chosen the wrong<lb/>
site of Camp Lazear. After some trouble, Moran and I relocated the true site. The<lb/>
government objects to our findings, but we are absolutely right and I am sure can<lb/>
prove it to anyone who will accept responsible proof. I will be glad to send you a<lb/>
copy of my paper or papers after they are finished.</p>
<p>I notice that in one of your reports which you sent me, you advised that<lb/>
someone get the story of Kissinger and Moran while they were alive. I have already<lb/>
done this and hope to publish these stories, under their own names. They needed<lb/>
considerable editing and checking, as their memories were somewhat faulty. Although<lb/>
both are fine men, each has lived the story so much that unconsciously he has strayed<lb/>
a little from the truth. Curiously, Kissinger's original story is that he went first<lb/>
to Reed, and Moran went a few days later. Moran's letter to you indicated that he<lb/>
went first and Kissinger went the next day, each going alone. Moran's last version<lb/>
was that they went together and that he (Moran) was the spokesman. This is relatively<lb/>
unimportant as far as outsiders are concerned, but it is just one of the things I have<lb/>
had to straighten out.</p>
<p>May I ask you what all you sent to the library in Baltimore. I am going<lb/>
to write them and see if I can have some of the material made available for me in<lb/>
photostatic form. At the end of your pamphlet, on page 33, you say that a much more<lb/>
complete bibliography on yellow fever has been prepared with the help of the library<lb/>
of the American Museum of Natural History. I wrote to the librarian, but he did not<lb/>
send me this bibliography. Do you happen to have a copy which I could keep or copy?</p>

<salute>Very sincerely,</salute>
