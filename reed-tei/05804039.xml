Dr. Philip S Hench.<lb/>
Rochester. Minn,<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench,</salute>
</opener>
<p><unclear>Yours</unclear> of July 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> to hand &amp;<lb/>
&amp; contents noted. Yes I have several clippings<lb/>
of my late <unclear>brother</unclear> Dr Roger Post Ames &amp; will<lb/>
gladly send you by registered mail tomorrow<lb/>
also- his picture I read in the magazine<lb/>
called Hygia. of Oct. 1941 - <unclear>about</unclear> the <unclear>Conquerors</unclear><lb/>
of Yellow Fever, &amp; I think it was written by<lb/>
you. I still have the magazine I <unclear>would</unclear> be<lb/>
pleased to have any <unclear>article in</unclear> Yellow Fever.<lb/>
Several years ago, a Play called Yellow Jack<lb/>
was staged at the Little Theatre, &amp; I saw<lb/>
this Play. of course all parties are dead, but<lb/>
the parts were played by Tulane Professors.<lb/>
<unclear>there</unclear> was Dr. Reed- Dr Finlay <unclear>Carrol</unclear> Lazear <unclear>Ames</unclear><lb/>
&amp; so on well the party who <unclear>took</unclear> the part<lb/>
of Dr. Ames was well played, just like Ames<lb/>
<unclear>slow</unclear> &amp; dignified, the Tulane University sent<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f05804040"/>
me complimentary tickets as Dr Ames was<lb/>
a Tulane Graduate &amp; Charity Hospital<lb/>
AmbulanceStudent, he graduated before he<lb/>
was 21 yr- he was the youngest of his class<lb/>
&amp; <unclear>looked</unclear> the oldest, he had <unclear>grown,</unclear> <hi>side <unclear>burns</unclear></hi><lb/>
<unclear>Now</unclear> I do know my brother had the yellow fever<lb/>
while in Cuba. he <unclear>inoculated</unclear> himself by letting<lb/>
the <unclear>Stegomya</unclear> bite him &amp; <unclear>treated</unclear> himself &amp; I often<lb/>
heard Dr Ames say that Dr Lazear. was driven down<lb/>
in <unclear>Ambulance</unclear> to his tent to be <unclear>treated,</unclear> &amp; get <unclear>relapse,</unclear><lb/>
it was Dr. Ames <unclear>who</unclear> sent his widow all of<lb/>
his belongings to her &amp; she sent Dr. Lazear<lb/>
<unclear>napkin ring</unclear> back to Dr Ames in Cuba &amp; I still<lb/>
have the ring, as that time Ames was not married.<lb/>
Some time ago W. W. L. <unclear>Loyola</unclear> University had<lb/>
a Radio Broadcast on Yellow Fever, &amp; Dr Ames<lb/>
name was omitted I wrote to the Radio Station<lb/>
also sent the clipping for <unclear>them</unclear> to see that my brother's<lb/>
name, was one of the Yellow Fever experts-. I<lb/>
was <unclear>informed</unclear> that the books they read Dr. Ames<lb/>
name was not mentioned, This <unclear>Dr</unclear> Gus Lambert<lb/>
who you mention, should know if Dr Ames lived<lb/>
at the Camp- <unclear>My Brother</unclear> Fred Ames <unclear>may</unclear> tell me<lb/>
more when he <unclear>comes</unclear> in <unclear>town</unclear> at present he is on<lb/>
the <unclear>road.</unclear> will be in <unclear>town</unclear> Friday- as I think Fred<lb/>
knows- Lambert &amp; I think <unclear>until</unclear> him. If Dr. Ames<lb/>
was living he would be <unclear>72y-.</unclear> he has a son Dr. <unclear>Frederick W</unclear> Ames<lb/>
who is in the Army or Navy- <unclear>also a daughter</unclear> Dr Mary Ames<lb/>
who is a physician in a <unclear>Hospital</unclear> in Detroit, Mich<lb/>
both are Children <unclear>Specialists,</unclear> he also has a <unclear>cripple</unclear><lb/>
