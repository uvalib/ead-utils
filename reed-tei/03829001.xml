George A Kellogg, Esq.,<lb/>
257 Cornelison Avenue<lb/>
Jersey City, N.Y.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Mr. Kellogg:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You will, and with good reason, have been<lb/>
thinking that I am a most ungrateful specimen of the land of<lb/>
my birth, the Emerald Isle and, if I may be pardoned for say-<lb/>
ing so, one of the most hospitable little islands on the face<lb/>
of the globe. Alas and alack, in my neglect to acknowledge<lb/>
my appreciation of the honor accorded me by the House of Wyeth<lb/>
and your very good self, I am afraid I have forfeited my rights<lb/>
to the traditional gratefulness inherent in the sons of Erin.<lb/>
I hope not, however, since down deep in my heart I sincerely<lb/>
appreciate the honor which the Dean Cornwell painting, &ldquo;THE<lb/>
CONQUERORS OF YELLOW FEVER&rdquo; confer on my humble self. I want<lb/>
you to know this and I trust you will not think me ungrateful.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that, what with the<lb/>
necessity of earning an honest living, which I have tried to do<lb/>
since the tender age of nine, my spare time is extremely limited.<lb/>
Since the passage of the ACT of February 28, 1929, according<lb/>
Congressional recognition to all those who took part in the<lb/>
Walter Reed yellow fever experiments, my spare time has never<lb/>
sufficed to properly reply to the correspondence I have received<lb/>
from every section of the United States. Also, in my effort<lb/>
and desire to have the parts played by Reed and Finlay accepted<lb/>
on a solid basis by Cubans and Americans alike, I have written<lb/>
reams and reams of material, tediously drummed out on a machine<lb/>
with my two index fingers. Being herein Cuba, away from Home<lb/>
Office supervision, managing this Cuban subsidiary of Sun Oil<lb/>
Company, my duties to my employer could not be neglected. I<lb/>
am not - and please do not think so - trying to establish an<lb/>
alibi for my failure to reply, in the spirit which it was in-<lb/>
cumbent upon me to do, to your many missives to me in the past<lb/>
several months. I have been never able to school myself to the<lb/>
writing of short letters. Now, at 66, it is too late to even try.</p>
<p>I have not received the art prints announced<lb/>
in your letter dated July 24th. Most likely they are not ready<lb/>
as yet. I just wonder how many you would be kind enough to<lb/>
spare me for a few of my very dear friends. As soon as I re-<lb/>
ceive one of the large ones from you I have arranged to have a<lb/>
copy painted for me by a Rumanian refugee lady residing in Cuba<lb/>
at the present. Her work is pronounced excellent by critics<lb/>
(amateur) here.</p>
<p>With my sincere personal regards, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours sincerely</salute>
