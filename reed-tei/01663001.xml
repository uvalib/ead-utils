<salute>My precious Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>As I wrote<lb/>
only about a dozen lines in<lb/>
my last letter, I will write to-day,<lb/>
&amp; not wait till Tomorrow. I was<lb/>
very much ashamed of myself<lb/>
for not writing a longer letter &amp;<lb/>
had been upbraiding myself there-<lb/>
for, when lo! behold, I find that<lb/>
a certain young lady, whose name<lb/>
I refrain from mentioning, has<lb/>
&ldquo;gone and done likewise&rdquo;. Ah! me,<lb/>
I knew it would come to this! But<lb/>
I will proceed with my letter.<lb/>
In a former letter I told you<lb/>
that the &ldquo;Mess&rdquo; had invited Gen<add>l</add>-<lb/>
Humphreys to dine with them, and<lb/>
it remains for me to tell you<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01663002"/>
what a delightful evening we<lb/>
had. (However, since you are be-<lb/>
ing so highly entertained by the<lb/>
gentlemen of N. I doubt whether<lb/>
you will be interested in so<lb/>
small a matter as a dinner-<lb/>
party, &amp; for all I know, you<lb/>
may have tossed aside this letter<lb/>
unread, to listen to the sighs &amp;<lb/>
promises of a &ldquo;<hi>wealthy</hi>&rdquo; young gentle-<lb/>
man.) There were eighteen of us,<lb/>
arrayed in our brightest. 2<lb/>
generals, 2 majors, 1 captain,<lb/>
11 Lieutenants &amp; 2 civilians sat<lb/>
at the Table. It would be in vain<lb/>
for me to tell you of the num-<lb/>
ber of choice &amp; dainty dishes that<lb/>
pressed the sideboard, till it lit-<lb/>
erally groaned. We sat down at<lb/>
6.30 P.M. &amp; did not leave the table<lb/>
till after 10 o'clock. About 9 ocl.<lb/>
the wines were brought on, &amp; we<lb/>
all &ldquo;fell to&rdquo; <del>till</del> in such style<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01663003"/>
that our tongues were soon<lb/>
loosened &amp; vibrating in an in-<lb/>
describable manner! <hi>All, except<lb/>
mine</hi>. For a <hi>certain little angel's</hi><lb/>
sake, <hi>I</hi> abstained, only touching<lb/>
my lips to the sparkling draught<del>s</del><lb/>
as the various toasts were<lb/>
proposed &amp; drunk. At 11 o'clock<lb/>
we all dispersed &amp; sought our<lb/>
quarters, feeling satisfied that we<lb/>
had spent a most agreeable eve-<lb/>
ning. The following morning, I went<lb/>
to the City, expecting to meet my<lb/>
brother, but after a thorough<lb/>
search I found that he had de-<lb/>
layed in Norfolk till Saturday.<lb/>
Monday, I again went down to<lb/>
shake his hand, &amp; this time, was<lb/>
successful. The day was a disagree-<lb/>
able one, but I immediately set<lb/>
out with him to see the sights.<lb/>
From 10 a.m. till 2 P.M, we were bus-<lb/>
ily travelling- At the latter hour, I sat<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01663004"/>
him down at the House of the<lb/>
young lady who was to be mar-<lb/>
ried at 5 P.M. Calling at 6 P.M.<lb/>
I found that the ceremony had<lb/>
passed off uninterruptedly &amp; the<lb/>
happy couple had departed for<lb/>
the train. Jumping into a carriage<lb/>
we were quickly driven to the Fer-<lb/>
ry &amp; were as soon aboard the<lb/>
Cars for Whitestone &amp; at 8 P.M.<lb/>
reached the Post. In the morning, we<lb/>
were off by 8 o'clock &amp; in the City<lb/>
by 9.30. Although the weather was<lb/>
wretched- rain falling all day long-<lb/>
I never checked my course till 11<lb/>
P.M- showed him the Stock Exchange-<lb/>
the Gold Room- Trinity church- (climbed<lb/>
to the top of its steeple)- the New P.O.<lb/>
building- Stewart's Store- Central<lb/>
Park- Mosdy &amp; Saukey- etc, etc.<lb/>
This morning he left City at 9 o'clock &amp;<lb/>
I hastened home, weary &amp; worn,<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01663005"/>
to write to you. Reaching home, I<lb/>
found a surprisingly long epistle,<lb/>
<add>to</add> a few parts of which, please allow<lb/>
me to make reference. You say that<lb/>
some, who pretend friendship, have<lb/>
been telling you of the &ldquo;horrors&rdquo; of the<lb/>
Army. Now, my little Sweetheart,<lb/>
will you convey my compliments<lb/>
to those &ldquo;friends&rdquo; &amp; tell them that I<lb/>
am much obliged to them for their<lb/>
kindness &amp; especially for talking of<lb/>
affairs concerning which they know<lb/>
<hi>absolutely nothing</hi>. Tell them,(&amp; I hold<lb/>
myself responsible for what I say,)<lb/>
that the &ldquo;horrors&rdquo; of the Army are all<lb/>
a <hi>myth</hi> &amp; only known to those who<lb/>
know nothing of Army life. Tell them,<lb/>
morever, that I would not take you from<lb/>
your home, did I not know that you<lb/>
will go to as comfortable a home<lb/>
as any young lady that ever left<lb/>
Murfreesboro-- and that you will be<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01663006"/>
surrounded -- by just as many<lb/>
comforts, &amp; supported by as strong<lb/>
an arm! Really, it almost nauseates<lb/>
me when I hear people talk of<lb/>
the dreadful life of an Army Officer<lb/>
&amp; especially <add>the sad lot of</add> his wife -- and this from<lb/>
the very people who would only<lb/>
be too happy &amp; proud to receive<lb/>
an offer from the same source!<lb/>
Why, my darling, don't let them talk<lb/>
to you, as if you were taking upon<lb/>
your<add>self</add> the life of a slave! As if<lb/>
you were resigning friends, com-<lb/>
forts &amp; happiness! As if you were<lb/>
going to live forever upon the<lb/>
borders of Civilization &amp; never<lb/>
enjoy enlightened society! As if<lb/>
you were joining yourself to a<lb/>
man who can't provide sub-<lb/>
sistence for you &amp; of whom you<lb/>
should be ashamed! When they<lb/>
make such assertions, ask them for<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01663007"/>
the <hi>proofs</hi>- (<hi>one</hi> case would establish<lb/>
the truth of what they say) &amp; see how<lb/>
very quickly such &ldquo;friends&rdquo; will sub-<lb/>
side! Up to the present time, I have<lb/>
met several ladies, wives of Army<lb/>
officers, &amp; unless I am much<lb/>
mistaken, they seem to enjoy life<lb/>
as much as any ladies whom<lb/>
I have ever met.</p>
<p>So there is a &ldquo;<hi>wealthy</hi>&rdquo; young gen-<lb/>
tleman who might make you<lb/>
happy, if you were not &ldquo;fet-<lb/>
tered&rdquo;. I pray you, do not let<lb/>
me stand in the way of wealth<lb/>
&amp; happiness! Although you are<lb/>
slightly fettered, think of the<lb/>
&ldquo;horrors&rdquo; that await you, before<lb/>
turning a deaf ear to him! He<lb/>
has everything that heart can de-<lb/>
sire, perhaps, &amp; you could live<lb/>
in the City of Norfolk. How very<lb/>
pleasant that would be! Miserable<lb/>
mortal that I am! to have been<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01663008"/>
born <hi>poor</hi>! Yeh, thank Heaven,!<lb/>
the word &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; doesn't give<lb/>
me as much anxiety as it does<lb/>
others. Give me enough for my<lb/>
ordinary wants, &amp; a clean con-<lb/>
science, &amp; I ask no more.<lb/>
Concerning your correspondence<lb/>
with the Baltimore gentleman,<lb/>
of course, I have nothing to say,<lb/>
other than to remark, that you<lb/>
must allow your own judge-<lb/>
ment to decide whether it is<lb/>
proper to correspond with a<lb/>
gentleman who does not so<lb/>
much as ask a correspondence,<lb/>
but goes upon the assumption<lb/>
that you will answer his letter.<lb/>
Should you conclude to share<lb/>
a part of your leisure moments <add>with him</add><lb/>
I trust that you will not forget<lb/>
to occassionally write to your<lb/>
own fond &amp; devoted,</p>
<closer>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
