<salute>Dear Mayne:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am returning your MSS. with criticisms. I am marking the Mar-<lb/>
gins: (1): (2) etc. and in this paper saying what I think is true of<lb/>
these places.</p>
<p>(1) This paragraph is <hi>most true</hi>. I have always preached this<lb/>
and have said that I believed Koch's <hi>long</hi> administration of quinine<lb/>
was not only to sterilize his carriers, but to keep them free from<lb/>
infection--i. e. uninfectable--until the infected Anopheles in flight<lb/>
died. Of course, this was on the supposition that active Anopheles<lb/>
might carry infection as long as they lived.</p>
<p>(2) True. I think I might be inclined to insert the words &ldquo;un-<lb/>
der different conditions&rdquo; after &ldquo;viability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(3) This is all right and timely. Would not the logical con-<lb/>
nection be better preserved by removing the 2nd. sentence of this<lb/>
par., so as to be the 4th. as indicated. Just a change in form.<lb/>
Don't you mean too: &ldquo;it is known to what definite periods mosquitoes<lb/>
harbor malaria parasites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(4) Am glad that you brought this out again. Anopheles may<lb/>
exist and be of little sanitary importance. <add>on account of small number</add></p>
<p>(5) This temperature was doubtless chosen to produce the maximum<lb/>
longevity of (intermittently?) active Anopheles. It is not far from<lb/>
the winter temperature of Memphis or--say--Natchez. Were they not<lb/>
&ldquo;sprawled&rdquo; part of the time?</p>
<p>It seems to me rather a study of longevity in hibernation (in-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00926003"/>
(in-<lb/>
2<lb/>
termittent hibernation as we have it in the South) than under natural<lb/>
conditions of activity--which is what (1) stated it was desireable to<lb/>
determine.</p>
<p>(6) Temperatures might be given, I presume, higher than in (5).</p>
<p>(7) Should not you change your word &ldquo;subsist&rdquo; as she &ldquo;sustains<lb/>
life on a vegetable diet?&rdquo; Does she require blood for oviposition<lb/>
of fertile eggs?</p>
<p>(8) What number (of each species) were found infected? At what in-<lb/>
terval after the blood-meal were the degenerated sporozoits found?</p>
<p>it is hard to say if parasites would develope at this temperature or<lb/>
no--certainly it was about the lower limit for it. The mean of extremes<lb/>
is 61%--what the mean was, one does not know.</p>
<p>(9) &ldquo;Up to 74 days&rdquo; seems indefinite. If applied, say, from the<lb/>
15th. day on, I would conclude that my Anppheles never became <hi>infective</hi>--<lb/>
i. E. never had efficient sporozoits in their salivary glands--or else the<lb/>
men bitten were unusually insusceptible.</p>
<p>(10) I understand that the insects containing these P. fals. also<lb/>
failed to infect and that these sporozoits were &ldquo;sluggishly motile&rdquo; also.<lb/>
Am I right?</p>
<p>(11) I understand, this was a mosquito of Par. 8: kept, except the<lb/>
first 6 days, at low temperature? (12) and (13): Tend to show that failure<lb/>
to infect man is insufficient evidence of absence of living sporozoits in<lb/>
the salivary glands: Were these &ldquo;lively sporozoits&rdquo; actively motile or no?</p>
<p>It seems to me, however, that for your determinations of (1) length<lb/>
of Anopheles life in nature: (2) length of time she remains infected for<lb/>
the purpose of par. (1) of this article, that the observations must be<lb/>
made under more nearly normal conditions of temperature etc. than those<lb/>
you have detailed. It seems to me you have worked almost under the con-<lb/>
ditions of hibernation.</p>
<p>Obviously, since what we really wish to determine (for the purposes<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00926004"/>
purposes<lb/>
3<lb/>
of Par. (1) is the duration of the infectivity of A. to man, the ideal<lb/>
way would be to depend on human experiments. This, I think, is not jus-<lb/>
tifiable, and, in spite of the findings of (12) and (13) of your paper,<lb/>
I judge that we will have to judge her infective when we find <unclear>living</unclear><lb/>
(<hi>active</hi>) sporozoits in her salivary glands.</p>
<p>In any case, it seems to me necessary to keep your mosquitoes at a<lb/>
temperature as near as possible the natural one at the time,<lb/>
since you wish to apply your findings to the purposes of (1) in your<lb/>
paper.</p>
