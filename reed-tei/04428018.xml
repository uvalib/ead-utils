<p>Truby reports on his health and comments on attempts to have Ames included as a member of the Reed yellow fever board, which Truby insists is not historically accurate. He notes that Hench is still working for the preservation of Building No. 1 at Camp Lazear.</p>

Mr. Paul L. Tate<lb/>

Berkeley 3, Calif.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Tate:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of June 12 is among those awaiting an<lb/>
answer from me. I have made slow but continuous progress<lb/>
since you last heard from me. My walking is very slow<lb/>
but is getting there. I still have not got strength to<lb/>
walk with safety alone but I can see progress almost<lb/>
daily. Quite remarkable for an old man, I think.</p>
<p>(I read with interest what you had to say about Dr. Brumby's)<lb/>
(efforts to construe Ames' duty at Camp Lazear as being)<lb/>
(a member of the Reed Board. Of course, that would not)<lb/>
(hold water as I wrote to Dr. Brumby two or three years)<lb/>
(ago. It was I who suggested to him that the only thing)<lb/>
(I knew of to honor Ames was to have his Tulane University)<lb/>
(friends erect a memorial to his honor in New Orleans.)<lb/>
(I am glad that Dr. Brumby is trying to get action along)<lb/>
(those lines. <hi>Ames deserved it</hi> but he was definitely <hi>not</hi>)<lb/>
(entitled to <hi>membership</hi> as Dr. Brumby is trying to prove.)</p>
<p>on Roll of<lb/>
<hi>Honor</hi></p>
<p>I am still at the Letterman and I am talking Physio-<lb/>
therapy exercises which are pretty hard for an old fellow.<lb/>
However, I have managed to do them and the results, while<lb/>
slow, are extremely good. I think that I will soon be<lb/>
able to go home and come here for the PT work.</p>
<p>I have just had a letter from Dr. Hench. He is actively<lb/>
trying to get the Cuban people to erect a memorial at<lb/>
Camp Lazear which will protect the little building that<lb/>
still remains there and which will not last much longer<lb/>
unless protected from the elements. Cubans persist in<lb/>
trying to call it a memorial to Finlay but Dr. Hench<lb/>
objects to that as of course he should.</p>
<p>I am glad to see that you are holding up so well and I<lb/>
hope that some time in the near future we may be able to<lb/>
get together for a brief meeting.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
