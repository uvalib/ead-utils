<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In pursunce of a telephone message from Dr. Frost, I went over to Baltimore<lb/>
last Wednesday morning <add>June 19</add> (on the 7.55 train), taking with me all the material which Dr.<lb/>
Frost will need when he resumes the final <unclear>editing</unclear> of the History of Yellow Fever.<lb/>
I also took him the very beautifulcopy of Merriam's map of the life zones of the U. S.,<lb/>
which was made during Father's lifetime for Section 1. Frost already has, in his<lb/>
safe, the three tracings I had made from the Mexican Codices concerning the much-<lb/>
discussed year 1 Rabbit (1454).</p>
<p>The only things remaining to be completed before Frost's return are</p>
<p>A: Two photostats (for which I have already made arrangements) of (a) plate 63<lb/>
of the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel and (b) of the excerpt from this plate concerning<lb/>
the epidemic of 1648. I didn't know which Frost might prefer so had them both done--<lb/>
for seventy-five cents. Certainly not excessive! They will be turned over to Miss<lb/>
Brown when completed and she will either send or bring them to me here.</p>
<p>B: <hi>Re</hi> the filling in of our outline maps, Mr. Weckerly, the Chief Illus-<lb/>
trator, has been critically ill, and I was not able to see him until a few days ago.<lb/>
He assures me, however, that there be abundant time for filling in the lettering (in<lb/>
pencil) before Dr. Frost's return--nothing will be inked in untilit has Frost's vis&eacute;.<lb/>
After talking things over with Mr. Weckerly, I decided that I could simplify his work<lb/>
(and, of course, lessen the time he would have to put on the maps, by putting in about<lb/>
a week's more work on them myself. I have therefor brought the &ldquo;geographic&rdquo; cards<lb/>
to &ldquo;Dunlora&rdquo; with me as well as my long-suffering Remington &ldquo;portable,&rdquo; which I have<lb/>
used so little of late that despite an extensive--and expensive!--&ldquo;overhauling&rdquo; <del>I find</del><lb/>
I find it far less easy to handle than my Underwood <add>&ldquo;</add>standard,<add>&rdquo;</add> as you probably find it<lb/>
less easy to read.at least until the mechanism for spacing loosens up a litt.e.</p>
<p>After the &ldquo;geographic cards&rdquo; go back to Mr. Weckerly, there will be--so far as I<lb/>
<unclear>can see</unclear>--practically nothing else for me to do in connection with the book until Dr.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fc0326050"/>
-2-<lb/>
Dr.<lb/>
Frost resumes work on the final editing--about August 1st. he thinks. Dr. Frost<lb/>
suggests my spending my time during August between Baltimore and &ldquo;Dunlora,&rdquo;. This I<lb/>
shall be glad to do if we find it does not in any way retard the work on the MS. Of<lb/>
course, if we find that there seems even the <unclear>[unclear]test</unclear> possibility of this, I shall at<lb/>
once move back to Washington. My apartment there is available at any moment as I<lb/>
refused to sub-let it even for a few weeks lest I relieve the <add>present</add> double financial &ldquo;output&rdquo;<lb/>
at the greater cost of not being ready for any eventuality in connection with the book.</p>
<p>It was an unspeakable relief to get here last night, the first time (save one<lb/>
week-end last October) that I've been out of either Baltimore or Washington for twenty-<lb/>
three months. Washington has been horribly hot of late, and though I worked with an<lb/>
electric fan whenever practicable, I am considerably &ldquo;the worse for wear&rdquo; and <hi>very</hi><lb/>
glad to get away.</p>
<p>With very best remembrances, in which Mrs. Darling (to whom I 'phoned this morn-<lb/>
ing asks to be included)</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
