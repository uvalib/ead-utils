Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Beato:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Do you remember in April of this year Senorita Maria Teresa<lb/>
Rojas and her friend, Senorita Lydia Cabrerra, brought Mr. John Moran of Havana<lb/>
and me around to call on you, to ask you for some data regarding the work of Dr.<lb/>
Finlay and of Major Walter Reed and the U.S. Army in discovering the cause of<lb/>
yellow fever. You were very kind to us. This October, the American college where<lb/>
Dr. Lazear went to school, is dedicating a memorial building in his honor, and I<lb/>
have been asked to make an address on the conquest of yellow fever. There are a<lb/>
number of points about which I am anxious to have information, but have not yet<lb/>
been able to get it. I understand that you are the official historian of the province<lb/>
of Havana, and I am taking the liberty of writing to you asking if you can give me<lb/>
some information or give me the name of someone who might be able to.</p>
<p>I am anxious to find out the following:</p>
<p>When was the Camp Columbia (made up of tents) erected, and what<lb/>
was on the site before hand?</p>
<p>When was the tent Camp Columbia torn down and replaced by the<lb/>
wooden Columbia Barracks?</p>
<p>When was the latter torn down and replaced by the present<lb/>
Military City?</p>
<p>Do you know of any written history of Camp Columbia or
Columbia<lb/>
Barracks?</p>
<p>Do you know whether the history of Las Animas Hospital has ever<lb/>
been written up?</p>
<p>Is there a historian or other official in the town of Marianao<lb/>
that could find me an old map showing the locations of Camp Columbia and of the town<lb/>
of Marianao as of 1900?</p>
<p>Is there a librarian in Havana or Marianao or some other official<lb/>
or historian who might have old photographs of Columbia Barracks? and of Las Animas<lb/>
Hospital, of the <unclear>Maestranza</unclear> and of Military Hospital #1 as of 1900?</p>
<p>Military Hospital No. 1 was used by U.S. Army during the Cuban<lb/>
War, and was situated on Principe Hill overlooking the city of Havana. Here Dr. Agramonte<lb/>
did some of his work. Am I correct that this was originally the hospital Alfonso XIII?<lb/>
I am anxious to find some old photographs of this hospital and also to know exactly<lb/>
where it was located. Mr. Moran thought that the Calixto Garcia Hospital was now on the<lb/>
site.</p>
<p>I certainly appreciate whatever help you can give me. To save you<lb/>
the labor of answering this by long hand, will you permit me to have Mrs. R. Hart<lb/>
Phillips, Manzana de Gomez, 553, who does secretarial work, and meets you at your con-<lb/>
venience, and type your answers for me. I shall be delighted to pay the charge. I shall<lb/>
also be delighted to express my appreciation for your help when I publish my paper.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
