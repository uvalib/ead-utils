<p>Anything relating to the episode of Walter<lb/>
Reed and yellow fever is of interest to me and I<lb/>
have great regard also for the work that Dr. Philip<lb/>
S. Hench has been doing in the time he could spare<lb/>
from a busy professional life to make an exhaustive<lb/>
study of the whole episode and the part contributed<lb/>
by each of Reed's assistants to the work of the Y.F.<lb/>
Board. I don't know just what the two Cuban<lb/>
versions of the painting are to which you refer but<lb/>
in the painting of Mr. Cornwell which they sent me<lb/>
Reed certainly occupies the center of the stage<lb/>
and is not at all in the background - nor do I<lb/>
see any resemblance to a stuffed shirt in his<lb/>
attitude or expression. It is Dr. Carlos Finlay<lb/>
who is off on one side. I think that his<lb/>
contribution was a very important one and altho.<lb/>
his experiments on men were failures, as were<lb/>
the first series by the Reed Board, he had<lb/>
sound epidemiological arguments for his theory<lb/>
which I know impressed Reed because he<lb/>
repeated them to me. I always give Finlay<lb/>
the credit for the <hi>discovery</hi> and the identification<lb/>
of the genus of mosquito which was the vector,<lb/>
and also for inventing the technique by which<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06310043"/>
2<lb/>
the stegomyia can be carried to the patient for infection,<lb/>
and to the volunteer for experiment in a test tube with<lb/>
a cotton stopper. But you cannot make a common<lb/>
pungens bite that way. She just won't do it. But<lb/>
while Finlay's work convinced nobody in 19 years,<lb/>
Reed's <hi>demonstration</hi> convinced the medical world.<lb/>
As Dr. Goldberger of the P.H.S. expressed it. Walter<lb/>
Reed's demonstration &ldquo;converted a discredited hy-<lb/>
pothesis into an established doctrine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>John H. Musser in his Internal Medicine Lea &amp;<lb/>
Febiger 1932 does not mention Finlay's name in<lb/>
the page devoted to the <hi>History</hi> of Yellow-Fever.<lb/>
The Cubans in their monument to Finlay do not<lb/>
mention the name of Reed, tho. they do have Lazear's<lb/>
name on it. Both were wrong. I do not think<lb/>
that well educated Americans should take part in<lb/>
the squabble as to the credit of each. I was<lb/>
present at the dinner given by the doctors of Havana<lb/>
to Finlay to celebrate the demonstration by Reed<lb/>
and his assistants of the Finlay theory. Finlay,<lb/>
Reed, General Wood and I think Gorgas were<lb/>
there tho. Gorgas had not accepted &ldquo;the r&ocirc;le of<lb/>
the mosquito as the only or even the usual way<lb/>
of conveying the disease&rdquo;, nor had he two months<lb/>
later when Gen. Wood put him to work on the<lb/>
mosquito campaign. Dr. John Guiteras touched<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06310044"/>
3<lb/>
on the question of relative credit in a beautiful<lb/>
speech in which he compared Finlay to<lb/>
Patrick Manson and Reed to Ronald Ross in<lb/>
their work on the r&ocirc;le of the mosquito in<lb/>
malaria. This seemed to us all to be a fair<lb/>
division of the credit at that time. (Dec. 22, 1900)<lb/>
and I have seen no reason to alter my<lb/>
opinion since.<lb/>
Thanks for your letter.</p>
