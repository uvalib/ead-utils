<salute>My dear Colonel Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I ought long ago to have acknowledged your friendly<lb/>
kindness in taking so much trouble, but the fact is that between<lb/>
doing my daily work, and hurrying back and forth between here and<lb/>
New York, I have neglected my mail in such a way as to cause me<lb/>
to feel I owe an apology to a great many people.</p>
<p>Your letter and the enclosures came just after the<lb/>
final proofs had been read. Happily, though, nearly all the<lb/>
points you made had already been caught and corrected. We showed<lb/>
the proofs of that chapter to some twelve or fifteen persons, and<lb/>
among them they supplied us with practically all the corrections<lb/>
mentioned in your own letter and memorandum. The chapter as it<lb/>
appears in the book will be very different from the original proof<lb/>
which you saw.</p>
<p>You are quite right about the source of most of the<lb/>
material. As I stated in a footnote, I started with the book written<lb/>
by Mrs. Gorgas and Hendrick; but through the device of showing the<lb/>
proof to a large number of people, I have been able to catch all the<lb/>
changes.</p>
<p>As to the amount of credit due General Wood, I was<lb/>
fortunate enough in this respect also to be set right by a number<lb/>
of persons who read the proof, and also by allusions to General<lb/>
Wood's part, which I found in various books, such as Harvey Cushing's<lb/>
&ldquo;Life of Dr. Osler&rdquo;, and others.</p>
<p>All in all, I think that substantially all the points<lb/>
made in your memorandum have already been changed in the proof. I<lb/>
am keeping your memorandum, as well as the one from General Wood<lb/>
and the one from Colonel Dorey. When the matter of a second edition<lb/>
of the history comes up, if there are still any changes that need<lb/>
to be made, I will have your material.</p>
<p>I may add that I have been very much impressed by<lb/>
finding the abundant testimony of contemporaries to the effect<lb/>
that a considerable measure of credit was due General Wood. The<lb/>
fact that Colonel Gorgas' superior happened to be a medical man<lb/>
made a great deal of difference. It is possible that a non-medical<lb/>
Governor-General of Cuba might have given Gorgas the same support<lb/>

that General Wood did. It is possible, I say; but Colonel Gorgas'<lb/>
experience with a different sort of superior at Panama teaches us what<lb/>
might have happened - or rather, what might have failed to happen -<lb/>
at Havana.</p>
<p>I am indebted to you for your trouble. I hope you will<lb/>
look on the trouble you have taken as a contribution to accuracy of<lb/>
history.</p>
<p>From your point of view, and from the point of view of<lb/>
getting the record straight and keeping it straight, it occurs to me<lb/>
it might be wise and practicable for you to get your corrections of<lb/>
the Gorgas book together in a collection and deposit them with some<lb/>
organization where they will be sure to come to the attention of<lb/>
future historians. There is such an institution - it is one of the<lb/>
Carnegia endowments, in the Woodward Building here in Washington.</p>
