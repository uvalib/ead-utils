<salute>My dear Tina and Lydia:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have had a very nice letter from Mrs. Smith inviting me to visit Havana<lb/>
during a Nutrition Week to say something, presumably at a press conference,<lb/>
in behalf of the importance of nutrition and presumably to receive a decora-<lb/>
tion at that time. Please see the letter which I have sent to her.</p>
<p>I find it a little difficult to plan anything definite yet; first of all, be-<lb/>
cause I have heard nothing official regarding the decoration and have not<lb/>
heard from you and Mrs. Smith whether those who have so graciously decided<lb/>
to give me the decoration want to do it at that time; and secondly, the<lb/>
invitation from Mrs. Smith merely to make some remarks regarding nutrition<lb/>
at a press conference finds me a little uncertain as I am not a nutritionist<lb/>
but a rheumatologist. I will certainly need help from Doctors Williams and<lb/>
Harris regarding this matter.</p>
<p>May I tell you in confidence (although you can discuss it with Mrs. Smith<lb/>
if you choose to do so) that we members of the staff must report to the ap-<lb/>
propriate committee here the purpose of the trips that we take on clinic time.<lb/>
I feel certain that the committee would permit me to go to Cuba briefly to<lb/>
accept this high honor and they would be quite willing for me to help<lb/>
sponsor nutrition week at the same time, but I don't believe that they would<lb/>
want me to go to Cuba just for a press conference if there was nothing else<lb/>
involved, that is no meeting and so on. Of course I am allowed to go where<lb/>
I want on my vacation time but I must be careful in planning this as I have<lb/>
already promised (as I <unclear>wrote</unclear> you before) tentatively to make a quick trip<lb/>
to Stockholm next fall, which trip will have to be on vacation time. If<lb/>
you or Mrs. Smith can assure me of two things, that would help me greatly<lb/>
in planning the Havana trip: (1) that Doctors Williams and Harris, the scientific<lb/>
advisors for Nutrition Week, want me to come and will help me plan what to<lb/>
say, realizing that I am a rheumatologist, not a nutritionist, and (2) that<lb/>
the same visit will be agreeable regarding the matter of the decoration.</p>
<p>It will be nice indeed to see you if this works out but, as I said before,<lb/>
I have had no official word of any sort from the Cuban Government.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
