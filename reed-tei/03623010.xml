Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
MAYO CLINIC,<lb/>
Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>As per your letter of the 12th, Pogolotti and I went to<lb/>
see Sr. Adrian Mac&iacute;a, pronounced &ldquo;Mah-see-ah&rdquo;, this morning, one of the<lb/>
most influential of the three parties who own the unbuilt upon grounds<lb/>
of the &ldquo;Finca San Jose&rdquo;, including the limestone quarry and, per se, the<lb/>
little shack in which we are all so deeply interested now. I have his<lb/>
assurance that the shack is yours for the purpose you have in view and<lb/>
that sufficient ground around where the shack stands is also yours, if<lb/>
you should decide to leave it there, conditional upon consent of the two<lb/>
widows who, jointly with him, own the other two thirds of the ground,<lb/>
including the brick factory, the old and new quarries, etc., etc., Zun-<lb/>
zunegui having the limekilns leased from the parties mentioned but having<lb/>
no interest in the property itself. It appears that Z. sub-leases to the<lb/>
old lady who occupies the shack but is not the owner of either shack or<lb/>
any part of the ground around it. Sr. Mac&iacute;a has the greatest confidence<lb/>
that the two widows referred to will give their consent, after he explains<lb/>
your laudable purpose to them. The shack and a sufficient parcel to<lb/>
surround it, so far as Sr. Mac&iacute;a is concerned, would be ceded GRATIS. It<lb/>
is barely possible that provision to replace the shack by a modest wooden<lb/>
one might be in order and I do not think a shack of that kind would cost<lb/>
so very much. In the first place, it need not be double-walled. On the<lb/>
other hand, replacement may not be at all necessary, so he informs me, in<lb/>
view of the fact that whatever the old lady pays there to Z. is not in-<lb/>
cluded in his lease on the quarry. I gather that Z. and the old lady are,<lb/>
to a certain extent, squatters, the house having belonged to the grounds<lb/>
ever since the Americans left it to Dr. Rojas. In the meantime, while we<lb/>
were in Sr. Macias' office, he telephoned to Z. to please see to it that<lb/>
the shack was not to be touched or altered in any way until further notice<lb/>
from him (Mac&iacute;a). Since the airmail is due to close within a half hour,<lb/>
I cannot write you very much more than this.</p>
<p>Please write a letter to Sr. Mac&iacute;a, via AIRMAIL, upon<lb/>
receipt of this, thanking him for his generous and noble impulse in<lb/>
connection with this matter, as expressed in the above lines, through<lb/>
Sr. Pogolotti and your humble servant. His address is as follows:<lb/>
Sr. Adrian Mac&iacute;a,<lb/>
Manzana de Gomez No. 325,<lb/>
HABANA, CUBA.</p>
<p>Too little time to explain why you have not received the<lb/>
photostats. I hope to get them off tomorrow by airmail. I DO NOT LEAVE<lb/>
HAVANA UNTIL SUNDAY NIGHT, OCTOBER 20TH. Do not know how you arrived<lb/>
at date of my departure as the 16th.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Hurriedly but sincerely,</salute>
