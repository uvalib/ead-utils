<salute>Dear Doctor Monroe:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter without date received. I have delayed answering it,<lb/>
because I have no time in the week to answer any personal mail.</p>
<p>1/ I can't think that you gained the impression from anything<lb/>
that I ever wrote that the total population of a region in which yel-<lb/>
low fever was permanently endemic must be at least equal to that of a<lb/>
single large town sufficient for such endemicity. It may be, but since<lb/>
the fever would spread more slowly in such a region it would take<lb/>
longer to immunize and hence be less apt to die out spontaneously.</p>
<p>2/ Your point that yellow fever would continue in a community<lb/>
longer in proportion as active aegypti approach the critical number--<lb/>
being, of course, in excess of it--is well taken, remembering, how-<lb/>
ever, that the critical number is sufficient to continue the disease.<lb/>
It has no other definition. If the temperature falls then so as to<lb/>
bring aegypti very near this limit, there is always a chance of it<lb/>
passing below it and extinguishing the fever. In Tampico, for instance,<lb/>
whether from diminished production of Stegomyia in winter or from the<lb/>
increased immunization of men in summer, yellow fever has frequently<lb/>
disappeared for as much as three or four years at a time. The same<lb/>
has been true of Matanzas: Neuvitas and a number of ports on the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01109021"/>
the<lb/>
2<lb/>
north of Cuba.</p>
<p>3/ So far as the number of susceptible people necessary to con-<lb/>
tinue the fever is concerned, one cannot tell anything of this unless<lb/>
he knew the movement of them, for instance: allowing four days for the<lb/>
average incubation in man and three days afterward for the time in which<lb/>
he is infective to mosquitoes and--say--42 days for the life of the mos-<lb/>
quito, if we had a single house with infected mosquitoes in it to begin<lb/>
with, the introduction therein of a susceptible man every 49 days (he<lb/>
to stay in the house) would continue the fever in that place indefinitely.</p>
<p>Naturally, of course, one can never space either the time of ar-<lb/>
rival of susceptible people or ensure their going into an infected house,<lb/>
but I think in general we might say that the introduction of eight sus-<lb/>
ceptible men per annum, living as they would live, would not suffice to<lb/>
continue yellow fever in a village.</p>
<p>4/ Spite of the altitude of Bucaramanga, I profoundly doubt if<lb/>
yellow fever would be apt to be permanently endemic in such a place. It<lb/>
did not remain so in Heredia or San Domingo in Costa Rica, nor in La<lb/>
Mesa in Colombia, in all three of which it spread slowly, on account<lb/>
(one feels sure) of sparcity of Stegomyia. I would certainly be willing<lb/>
to take my chance for even spontaneous elimination with a place which was<lb/>
so near the limit of Stegomyia breeding some months of the year than a<lb/>
place where the contrary condition existed. Compare, for instance,<lb/>
Monterey, which has frequently cleaned itself of yellow fever and Yucatan<lb/>
where it continued a long time.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
