Brigadier General, U.S.A.- Medical Corps.- Retired.<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco.- California.<lb/>
U.S.A.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Brigadier:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I hope you will excuse me for ad<add>r</add>essing you these lines, but it is<lb/>
due to your direct contact with research work done on Yellow Fever, carried out<lb/>
in Cuba during the years of the American Intervention in our Country. As in my<lb/>
recors it seems that you were assigned to the Hospital at the Barracks in Camp<lb/>
Columbia during the last months of 1899, as well as 1900, I am hoping you can<lb/>
furnish me with some data in regard to some points which I want to check up on;<lb/>
said points are de followings:</p>
<p><hi>FIRST</hi>.- Can you inform me in which place at Camp Columbia Dr Lazear practiced<lb/>
innoculations with mosquitoes (which I believe were eight cases) on American<lb/>
volunteer soldiers during the month of August, 1900?.- I presume thet the ino-<lb/>
culation practiced on Dr Carroll and on Private Dean were performed at the same<lb/>
place by Dr Lazear. Is this correct?.- Would you please state whether this was<lb/>
the place where Dr Ames had his so called &ldquo;Yellow Fever Wards&rdquo;, to attend yellow<lb/>
fever cases, or if on the contrary, the place I am investigating was one separa-<lb/>
te from the Camp (which I name &ldquo;Truby and Ames Camp for Yellow Fever Cases&rdquo;.-<lb/>
I think the place I refer to problably was a locality with a Laboratory, for I<lb/>
believe it was here where the members of the American Commision began their re-<lb/>
search work in the month of June 1900, to determine whether the Sanarelli Baci-<lb/>
llus were the cause of Yellow Fever.</p>
<p><hi>SECOND</hi>.- Can you inform me the exact place where Dr Lazear died?.- I was told<lb/>
that he died at the &ldquo;Truby and Ames Camp for Yellow Fever Cases&rdquo; that I mencio-<lb/>

ned before. Is this correct?-</p>
<p><hi>THIRD</hi>:- Do you remember Major Edmunds ever being confined to the &ldquo;Truby and Ames<lb/>
Camp for Yellow Fever Cases&rdquo;, during his yellow fever attack, which caused his death?<lb/>
I am quite sure he died on June 16, 1900,<add>18 at No 17 Gen Lee St AET<lb/></add> but I am uncertain where.</p>
<p><hi>FOURTH</hi>:- What sort of work were doctors Angles, Herrera and Silverio in charge of in<lb/>
regard to the work of the American Commision.</p>
<p>On account of needing this data to be accurate for the local history of Maria-<lb/>
nao, where I have assigned to write about the part referring to Yellow Fever, and<lb/>
the research carried out during the different periods of time in this town, I am<lb/>
taking the liberty of your kindness requesting this information. I hope you reply<lb/>
will be of great value for my records and work.</p>
<p>Furthemore, if it be possible, I would like to have one of your photographs.<lb/>
One of that epoc or as nearedt as possible, for it is my desire to illustrate my<lb/>
report with photographs of everyone in regard to this subject.</p>
