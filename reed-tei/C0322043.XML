<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I <unclear>wentoover</unclear> to Baltimore last Friday with the bibliographic<lb/>
file for the work done at the Library of the Surgeon General of the Army<lb/>
and stayed, and worked, at the Frosts until Labor Day. Dr. Frost was<lb/>
surprised and pleased at the amount Miss Brown and myself had accomplishe<lb/>
and hopes that he can <unclear>start</unclear> the final editing of the MSS by the end of <unclear>the</unclear><lb/>
second or third week of September. He thinks, however, that I had best<lb/>
stay in Washington for about five days of each week and go over to Balti-<lb/>
more for the other two: this because the references still to be verified<lb/>
have a better chance of being done here than in Baltimore, and Miss Brown<lb/>
and I together are more likely to trace them than she would be by herself.<lb/>
Of course, all routine methods of proceedure have already been tried:<lb/>
Index Medicus: Index of the Surgeon General and the Index of the Library <unclear>c</unclear><lb/>
Congress and <add>those</add> of foreign <add>and other domestic</add> libraries kept in the Library of Congress and<lb/>
the Library of the S. G. We are still finding things, however, by bib-<lb/>
liographies of other books: writing to various authors quoted in Father's<lb/>
book: personal interviews etc. etc. In this connection, I should be very<lb/>
grateful if, in addition to the short list of incomplete references I<lb/>
sent you on August 16th. (<hi>re</hi> matters of which I thought your Division<lb/>
would be cognizant) you would ask someone to complete the enclosed ref-<lb/>
erences, which I think must be from material in your files (Reports etc.<add>)</add><lb/>
as both Miss Brown and I have made exhaustive search for them elsewhere.<lb/>
Incidentally I have heard nothing from the first list I sent you, but hope<lb/>
I shall later, as those references also had been searched for <add>here</add> at length.</p>
<p>I hope, when you come to Washington, that you will be able<lb/>
to come to my apartment, as I should like to show you the locker truck<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0322044"/>
trunk-<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
ful of Father's bibliographic notes, both because I know they would in-<lb/>
terest you in themselves and also explain what must have otherwise have<lb/>
seemed an unproductive period after my return from the Hopkins: a period<lb/>
which was, on the contrary, the reason Miss Brown and I have been able<lb/>
to do so much in so short a time<del>.</del> <add>after starting work at the<lb/>
libraries.</add></p>
<p>I shall try to write you more later in the week, but Miss<lb/>
Brown has arrived for a night session, she having used up <del>most</del><add>so much</add> of her<lb/>
annual leave working for me at the Library of the Surgeon General that<lb/>
I am trying to supplement it with work at times that will not count against<lb/>
it. I judge that we shall work together intensively all through September<lb/>
and can't begin to tell you what a help she has been, and is.</p>
<p>With best remembrances, and looking forward to seeing you<lb/>
when you come to Washington,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>
