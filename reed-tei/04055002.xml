<salute>My dear Doctor Espinosa:</salute>
</opener>
<p>As we say in America, this is surely &ldquo;one on me&rdquo;. It is<lb/>
a good joke indeed that I was led to misunderstand your nice letter of<lb/>
January 10. I read Spanish very poorly and do not trust my knowledge<lb/>
at all. I handed your letter to a woman here who had lived several<lb/>
years in Cuba as a young girl. She gave me a brief word of mouth trans-<lb/>
lation and led me to believe that I had been asked to be a Director.<lb/>
This puzzled me, as I noticed definitely that you had signed your name<lb/>
as the Director; therefore, I sent the letter to a woman at the Mayo<lb/>
Clinic who translates Spanish. Indeed, she is the Spanish translator<lb/>
and interpreter and handles much of the personnel work with our South<lb/>
American patients who come to the Mayo Clinic. She sent me back a<lb/>
written translation which again stated that I had been appointed a<lb/>
Director. Indeed, she stated that in two different sentences. I was<lb/>
still puzzled but decided that probably it was an honorary appointment<lb/>
and that you were appointing honorary Directors in various countries,<lb/>
as is done by certain medical groups. Therefore, I wrote you as I did<lb/>
in my letter of 26 February.</p>
<p>Please rest assured that whether I am a self-appointed<lb/>
Director or not, I will be very happy indeed to cooperate with you<lb/>
in any way in your work. In recent years I have visited Cuba almost<lb/>
every winter, as my wife and I like to take our vacation partly in<lb/>
Florida and partly in Cuba. I hope to avail myself of the privilege<lb/>
of meeting you on my next visit and between us, we can drink a toast<lb/>
to you, as the real Director, and to me, as a self-appointed Director,<lb/>
now demoted!</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>PHILIP S. HENCH, Lt. Col., M.C.<lb/>
Chief of the Medical Service</signed>
