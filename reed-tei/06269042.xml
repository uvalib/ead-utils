<salute>My dear Colonel Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am very much obliged to you for your letter of July 30th<lb/>
with enclosed editorial. I appreciate also what you have said concerning<lb/>
the review of Gen. Gorgas' <unclear>life</unclear>. It needs a word of explanation.</p>
<p>When the book was sent to me I rather protested against a re-<lb/>
view because I feel so strongly concerning certain matters in Gen. Gorgas'<lb/>
career and knew that I could not honestly accept all that his wife would<lb/>
say about him. However, in spite of the fact that the book contains a<lb/>
number of things which I know to be untrue and makes claims for Gen. Gorgas<lb/>
which you have so well shown to be untenable, I was agreeably disappoint-<lb/>
ed in many ways, and must say I was much surprised to find that it ac-<lb/>
knowledged his disbelief in the mosquito conveyance of yellow fever. I<lb/>
therefore had less trouble in writing the review <unclear>than</unclear> I anticipated,<lb/>
but submitted to some modifications on the advice of the Managing Editor.</p>
<p>My attitude in the matter is easily explained. I am an old stu-<lb/>
dent of Sewanee, Tenn., at the time when Gen. Josiah Gorgas was Vice-Chan-<lb/>
cellor. For one year I boarded in Gen. Gorgas' house and can never for-<lb/>
get the motherly kindness shown to me by Mrs. Gorgas. I did not know<lb/>
Gen. W. C. Gorgas until many years after, as he was older and had left<lb/>
Sewanee, but when I met him, as I did a number of times, he was always the<lb/>
courteous gentleman, always gave me messages from his mother, and, what<lb/>
appealed to me perhaps even more than this, was his friendship for my<lb/>
cousin, David Gaillard, and his concern over the fact that David's death<lb/>
took place on leave and he (Gen. G.) was unable to pay his expense<lb/>
at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>My kindly feeling to Gen. Gorgas was almost entirely lost during<lb/>
the world war. I was thoroughly disgusted with the display of nepotism<lb/>
and the lack of fair play to the officers of the army who deserved pro-<lb/>
motion and recognition. Among these allow me to say that you are one, who<lb/>
should have been promoted to a generalship. I had the honor and pleasure<lb/>
of knowing Maj. Walter Reed. In fact he invited me to go with him to<lb/>
the Philippine Islands as bacteriologist on an expedition which never ma-<lb/>
terialized, and the object of which I do not now remember. I am a native<lb/>
of South Carolina and yellow fever has been my bread and meat, so to speak,<lb/>
from infancy, and as a result I am pretty well posted on the history of<lb/>
the disease and the efforts made to discover its cause. I was, therefore,<lb/>
aware of almost all that you say in your letter and in your editorial.<lb/>
The only thing that I did not know was that Dr. C. A. L. Reed was sent to<lb/>
the Canal Zone by Mr. Taft. I always thought the A. M. A. was responsible<lb/>
for this.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06269043"/>
<p>As to Gen. Gorgas, &ldquo;de mortuis nihil nisi bonum.&rdquo; I will only<lb/>
say that his most intimate friend never accused him of having much<lb/>
brains. He went further and higher on less work than any man I have<lb/>
ever known. From his official position in the Canal Zone he of course<lb/>
deserves much of the credit for the accomplishments there, and I do not<lb/>
grudge to him the honors he received, <add>except</add> the one which made him Surgeon<lb/>
General, an office for which he was absolutely unfit in almost every way,<lb/>
and especially from the fact that for ten or twelve years he had been<lb/>
out of touch with the army and did not know the army personnel. I also had<lb/>
the pleasure of knowing Surgeon General Torney intimately. In fact, he<lb/>
was my student at the U. <unclear>Pa.</unclear> in bacteriology, and I realize the truth<lb/>
of what you say concerning the preparation of the Medical Department for<lb/>
the great war under him and his predecessor.</p>
<p>You will see from this long letter some of the preparation I<lb/>
had for writing this review and understand the difficulties I was up<lb/>
against and the reasons why I held myself in check instead of telling a<lb/>
good deal that I know and would like to have made public.</p>
<p>If it is ever my good fortune to have a conversation with you<lb/>
I will be glad to tell you a good many more things unless this letter<lb/>
has already fatigued you.</p>
<p>With much respect and again thanking you for your letter, I am,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Mazyck P. Ravenel</signed>.
