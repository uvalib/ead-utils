Mr. John R. Kissinger<lb/>
Route 2 Box 1332<lb/>
St. Petersburg, Florida<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Kissinger:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was quite surprised to hear from you in Florida and am indeed<lb/>
sorry that you are on the west coast whereas I will be on the east coast with my<lb/>
wife and three children. I leave here today and will be at the Villa Atlantique<lb/>
Hotel, Palm Beach for about three and a half weeks except that I will go alone to<lb/>
Havana about March 28 for about one week. I want to conclude arrangements to<lb/>
purchase the site of Camp Lazear and the remains of Building #1. I have had<lb/>
much correspondence the past year about this and hope to be able to tell you all<lb/>
about it sometime. Mr. Moran has helped me a lot and introduced me to the owners<lb/>
of the land and so forth.</p>
<p>When I get this matter concluded, I will send you a copy of a<lb/>
fairly long report on <hi>The True Location of Camp Lazear</hi> which I am submitting to<lb/>
the Minister of National Defense in Cuba; the land may be memorialized by the<lb/>
Government. It is possible that sometime this summer, I may stop over to spend<lb/>
another day with you in Huntington. I also have had much correspondence with<lb/>
General Truby - almost volumes, also with General Kean, and I am slowly getting<lb/>
the details of the story ironed out. I intend to keep at it until the whole<lb/>
truth is known. Incidentally it is Truby's recollection that you volunteered<lb/>
first and I intend to straighten out the little tangle between you and Johnny<lb/>
Moran by getting incontrovertible evidence. If I can, I hope to find evidence<lb/>
that will be more important than memory which is often so faulty. I understand<lb/>
that it may still be possible to uncover in Washington, the records of the Post<lb/>
Hospital and that may have much data in it.</p>
<p>As for the Wyeth Company portrait, I am very glad that they have<lb/>
accepted my suggestions about the proposed scene and I am delighted that they plan<lb/>
to have you and Moran in it as <hi>representatives</hi> of all the soldier volunteers. I<lb/>
know Mr. Kellogg will appreciate any help you can give him.</p>
<p>I know you will be most interested in my report to Doctor Ramos<lb/>
whenever I can get a copy to you. It is illustrated with 50 photos, maps, and<lb/>
records. I still plan definitely to write-up your story and publish it under your<lb/>
name bit I want to straighten out some of the disputed points. Then no one can<lb/>
doubt what you or I say.</p>
<p>Please give my best to Mrs. Kissinger.</p>

<salute>Always sincerely yours,</salute>
