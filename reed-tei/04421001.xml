<p>Hench will inform Clark that Blossom plans to write a story about the Apache woman who worked in her parent's household. Hench offers to put her into contact with one of the editors of the Saturday Evening Post. He reports that the Cuban government seems prepared to do something about Camp Lazear, and he will send Blossom copies of the plans.</p>

Mrs. Blossom Reed<lb/>
Blue Ridge Summit<lb/>
Pennsylvania<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs. Reed:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of March 28 and am interested indeed to hear that<lb/>
Mr. Clark of William and Mary College was on the right track about the<lb/>
&ldquo;Indian woman&rdquo;. I shall write him and tell him that you yourself are<lb/>
writing a story on that. And who in the world would have a better<lb/>
right than you to do this story.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you are planning to write a story or two, I wonder if<lb/>
you kept a copy of your tentative manuscript written some years ago<lb/>
which you kindly deposited with me with the rest of your father's<lb/>
data. If not, and if you wish a copy, I will send you one at once and<lb/>
if, at any time, I can help you by checking any of the data that you<lb/>
deposited with me, I am yours to command.</p>
<p>I do not have many contacts with lay magazines, but I do know one of<lb/>
the chief editors of the Saturday Evening Post. I met him when he was<lb/>
here three years ago to write a story on cortisone and have kept in<lb/>
touch with him. His name is Steven Spencer. A year or so ago I ap-<lb/>
proached him in connection with a short story that Johnny Moran had<lb/>
written from Havana. At that time, unfortunately, Mr. Spencer was not<lb/>
interested as he said they had carried a story on Johnny Moran about<lb/>
ten years before and did not think that another one from him was ap-<lb/>
propriate at this time. I do not know, therefore, how sympathetic<lb/>
Mr. Spencer would be to a story about your father. In my opinion he<lb/>
ought to be and certainly a story about Walter Reed written by his<lb/>
daughter and/or son should have the highest priority. If I can help<lb/>
in any way, please let me know.</p>
<p>I have been meaning to write you and your brother and will do so as soon<lb/>
as I have time to write up a summary of my recent visit to Havana. At<lb/>
long last the Cuban Government seems about to do something for Camp<lb/>
Lazear. They plan to make a small park and a small memorial. I have<lb/>
just had copied here at the Clinic the blue print plans as drawn up<lb/>
by the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Sanitation. The plan<lb/>
leaves some things to be desired, but nevertheless it is a start in the<lb/>
right direction. I have had copies of the plans made for you and your<lb/>
brother and will send them shortly.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
