<salute>Dear Jack:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of December 11th. reached me this morning. <hi>Of course</hi>,<lb/>
I'm not only &ldquo;not averse to working&rdquo; during the Christmas holidays, but<lb/>
shall be very grateful to go over to Baltimore at that time and work<lb/>
with you for as long as is convenient to you. <hi>Re</hi> the above, I did not<lb/>
understand from Susan's telephone conversation that I was being in-<lb/>
vited over for any but festive purposes, hence my letter to her last<lb/>
night, saying that I did not feel that I ought to accept. My reason<lb/>
being that Miss Brown and I were expecting to use up the remainder of<lb/>
her leave, on work for the book, about the time for which Susan had<lb/>
asked me over. Now, of course, we will try to &ldquo;put things through&rdquo;<lb/>
before I leave for Baltimore.</p>
<p>Had a hectic session at the Carnegie with Morley to-day and got<lb/>
a <hi>lot</hi> more done than I anticipated. Will write you details within a<lb/>
day or two--the latter probably, as Morley did more in indicating the<lb/>
sources from which I could complete certain lines of inquiry than he<lb/>
did in furnishing specific data. He did both, however, and our confer-<lb/>
ence was <hi>well</hi> worth while. Incidentally, he told me that I had my mater-<lb/>
ial better prepared for handling in short order than anyone with whom he<lb/>
had ever worked. I told him that was inevitable with anyone of average<lb/>
intelligence who had been associated with yourself and Father.</p>
<p>I shall probably work at home to-morrow as Miss Brown is just get-<lb/>
ting over a cold and I can't afford to catch it and &ldquo;get sick and die&rdquo; unti<unclear>l</unclear><lb/>
the work on the book is done. After that a swift and economical demise<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0321031"/>
demise would be decidedly preferable to another illness like that of<lb/>
last winter. Father said <del>you</del><add>one</add> generally &ldquo;stayed dead even longer than<lb/>
it takes <del>even</del> to get over &ldquo;flu,&rdquo; but so far as the latter part of his<lb/>
statement is concerned, I'm still &ldquo;from Missouri.&rdquo; Glad am I that you<lb/>
are really feeling &ldquo;quite well again,&rdquo; after so severe an attack as you<lb/>
must have had!</p>
<p>With much love to the Susans, and thank you ever so much for<lb/>
planning to use your holidays in work on the book--there is no other<lb/>
way in which I should be so glad to spend <del>them</del><add>mine</add> this year.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly and gratefully yours,</salute>

P. S. Got a delightful letter from Dr. Vincent to-day. He had had a<lb/>
bad spill, his horse having slipped and thrown him and then rolled over<lb/>
him--fortunately the latter happened so quickly that no serious injury<lb/>
was done.<lb/>
