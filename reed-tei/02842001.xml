<p>Referring to the notes for memorandum dated August 23, 1906<lb/>
I beg to invite attention to the following facts which are incorrectly<lb/>
stated in the second paragraph on page 1.</p>
<p>(The final determination to investigate the mosquito theory was ar-<lb/>
rived at during an informal meeting of the board (Dr. Agramonte being<lb/>
absent) at Columbia Barracks on the evening before Dr. Reed's departure<lb/>
for the United States early in August 1901.) This subject had been a<lb/>
matter for <hi>daily discussion</hi>, pro and con, at our quarters, in the lab-<lb/>
oratory and elsewhere, and as Dr. Reed, Dr. Lazear and myself were<lb/>
quartered at the hospital, Columbia Barracks, and ate at the same table,<lb/>
there was constant opportunity for discussion of the various phases of<lb/>
the subject in which we were <add>all intensely</add> interested. Indeed the four members of the<lb/>
board had previously discussed the mosquito theory with Drs. Durham and<lb/>
Myers, with one another and with Dr. Charles Finlay whom they visited<lb/>
for the purpose of discussing the mosquito theory and ascertaining what<lb/>
data he might have to offer in support of it.</p>
<p>Truby doubts this</p>
<p>The proposal to submit ourselves to inoculation was made by <hi>myself</hi>,<lb/>
twice, before it was brought up by Dr. Reed, for the first time, at the<lb/>
meeting above mentioned, where it was finally decided upon by actual<lb/>
vote.</p>

<p>As I know the above statements to be absolutely true and as I was<lb/>
an actual participant in the work and in the interviews mentioned by<lb/>
me I feel bound to invite attention to statements that constitute a<lb/>
veritable contradiction of my written and oral statements made at va-<lb/>
rious times from actual knowledge of the occurrences themselves.</p>
