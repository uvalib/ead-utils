<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was deeply interested in your<lb/>
letter of July 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>, for both Dr Lazear &amp; Major Reed<lb/>
were very dear friends of mine, and anything<lb/>
I can do to clear up the pages of history<lb/>
as to the work they did in Cuba will be a<lb/>
pleasure.</p>
<p>Since my retirement from the Army I have<lb/>
been busy gathering up my old Cuban records,<lb/>
photographs, letters, official reports, etc., and<lb/>
under pressure of such men as Generals<lb/>
Ireland, Kean, F. F. Russell, &amp; Reynolds, I<lb/>
have been writing up the story as I saw<lb/>
it. From quite extensive records, &amp; from memory,<lb/>
I have been able to take things in chronological<lb/>
order, with names &amp; dates of important events,<lb/>
and who participated in them. As it is<lb/>
also a story of my own experiences and<lb/>
activities in Cuba, and because in telling<lb/>
the facts I will have the relatives &amp; friends<lb/>
of Carroll, Agramonte, Gorgas &amp; Finlay on<lb/>
my back, I have hesitated to publish it.</p>
<p>I am sure you have noted that after<lb/>
Reed's death, Carroll in a mild way began<lb/>
to tell <hi>what he did</hi>. Then after Carroll's death<lb/>
Agramonte told of <hi>the great importance of<lb/>
his work</hi><del>,</del> The friends of Gorgas (not Gorgas himself)<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03566002"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
and of Finlay tried to minimize Reed's<lb/>
work and rob him of the credit for his<lb/>
splendid scientific work at Camp Lazear-</p>
<p>I am sure you have also noted that Reed<lb/>
rarely referred to anything he did personally, but<lb/>
always of the Board's work. He wanted it<lb/>
that way and so expressed himself in a<lb/>
Baltimore address, referring especially to<lb/>
Lazear- Ireland, Kean and I have often<lb/>
discussed this subject and we have<lb/>
always stood together in insisting that<lb/>
all members of the Board should have<lb/>
equal glory for their achievements as a board-<lb/>
The fact remains however that Lazear<lb/>
got his results with mosquitoes without<lb/>
the help of anyone- Of course he was carrying<lb/>
out the plans which he and Reed had worked<lb/>
out, based on Carter's splendid observations<lb/>
and Ross' work on Malaria- Likewise Reed<lb/>
planned and did all the work at Camp Lazear<lb/>
without any help from Agramonte and very<lb/>
little from Carroll as he was still suffering<lb/>
from the effects if his attack of yellow fever-<lb/>
The two men who did more to make the Board's<lb/>
work possible were General Wood &amp; Major J. R. Kean.<lb/>
Both were magnificient in their support<lb/>
and constant assistance to Reed-</p>
<p>I am away from San Francisco, spending<lb/>
a couple of weeks or more in the Santa Cruz<lb/>
Mts- Consequently I have no records on<lb/>
my unfinished manuscript with me- This<lb/>
also accounts in the delay of your letter<lb/>

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA<lb/>
which reached me yesterday- When I<lb/>
return to S. F. I will have that part of my<lb/>
manuscript typed which pertains to Lazear's<lb/>
case of yellow fever and send it to you-</p>
<p>Naturally I hesitate to let someone else<lb/>
publish what I have written, for much of it<lb/>
is new and unknown to the public. As you<lb/>
have devoted so much time and study to<lb/>
the matter I am sure you would be greatly<lb/>
interested in what I have written, and I think<lb/>
it would jibe with information you obtained<lb/>
from Kissinger &amp; Moran. They knew what was<lb/>
going on at Camp Lazear, but probably did<lb/>
not know much of what went on at our<lb/>
quarters. Reed's rooms and my own were<lb/>
next to each other and the fine porch we had<lb/>
was the general meeting place of the members<lb/>
of the Board <add>except Agramonte</add> and the hospital staff. I was C. O.<lb/>
of the hospital at that time and as such had<lb/>
considerable to do in providing supplies,<lb/>
equipment &amp; personnel for Camp Lazear-</p>
<p>My story is quite long and it will be some<lb/>
time before it is ready to be typed, Besides parts<lb/>
of it are still unwritten so it could not be<lb/>
published for some months- If you could<lb/>
come out to California we could go over it<lb/>
and discuss various matters of interest to you.<lb/>
I do hope you get the essential facts<lb/>
straight. Unfortunately I haven't the necessary<lb/>
funds to make a trip East at this time on<lb/>
I would bring it to you- Before I publish<lb/>
it (if I do) I want to have Kean &amp; a few others<lb/>
go over it to get their approval or confirmation<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f03566004"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
of any doubtful statements.</p>
<p>I will be very glad to have you write<lb/>
me about any details and I think I can<lb/>
be of some help in giving you a general<lb/>
picture of what went on at Columbia Bks.<lb/>
Sidney Howard <add>in &ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo;</add> got much of his information<lb/>
from Kean, Moran &amp; me, but while he<lb/>
had many of the main facts straight, the<lb/>
story was inaccurate and far from the<lb/>
real picture- What a pity!</p>
<p>I do not know Mrs. Lazear's address.<lb/>
A long time ago I heard she was living in<lb/>
Los Angeles- The Surgeon General might be<lb/>
able to help you find her.</p>
<p>I hope to be back in S. F. about the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of<lb/>
this month, or a little later, and then will be<lb/>
able to give you the story about Lazear's<lb/>
infection- There <del>was</del><add>can be</add> no reflection on Reed<lb/>
for publishing the story as he did. <add>(On the Contrary I think it was to his Credit.)</add> He was<lb/>
convinced that Lazear's case was experimental,<lb/>
but consideration for L's family made him<lb/>
abide to Lazear's statement to Gorgas &amp; Carroll-</p>
<p>Lazear died, as you know, a week or so<lb/>
before Reed returned to Cuba and left no<lb/>
information for Reed <add>about his work,</add> except a small note book</p>
<p>I hope you can make this all out<lb/>
with not too much difficulty.</p>
