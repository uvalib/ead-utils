<title>Letter from Philip Showalter Hench to Blossom Reed, August 12, 1950</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Hench expresses regret that he was unable to attend Emilie Lawrence Reed's funeral, but hopes that Blossom Reed will now have time to rest. He informs her that he would be glad to receive and preserve any material of Emilie and Walter Reed's that she might come across in housecleaning, and that the University of Virginia, the Mayo Clinic and the Library of Congress have expressed interest in being permanent guardians of the Reed materials.</p>

Mrs. Blossom Reed<lb/>
Blue Ridge Summit<lb/>
Pennsylvania<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs. Reed:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am so very sorry that I was unable to pay my tribute to your<lb/>
mother and father by coming to Washington. It would have been a real<lb/>
honor to be one of the pall bearers. From what I have heard from General<lb/>
Kean and others, the ceremony was a beautiful one and a very distinguished<lb/>
one.</p>
<p>Now you, yourself, must get a long rest. The patience, understanding<lb/>
and loyalty that you have shown to your mother for so many years was truly<lb/>
remarkable and I know that it must have taken a great deal out of you. Now<lb/>
you must think of yourself for awhile. Mary and I have been wondering<lb/>
whether you plan to live in Blue Ridge Summit or whether you might move to<lb/>
Washington. I should think that the peace and quiet of your old home might<lb/>
be preferable, with visits to Washington.</p>
<p>With every good wish,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>

P.S.: If, in doing a certain amount of house cleaning, you come upon any<lb/>
data concerning your parents which you would wish to have preserved with<lb/>
the other material which you so kindly transmitted to me for my care, please<lb/>
know that I shall be glad indeed to be custodian of it until such time as it<lb/>
will be put in a permanent place. Three or four distinguished sources are<lb/>
anxious to be the permanent guardians of it. As you know, the Librarian<lb/>
of the Mayo Foundation and the Mayo Clinic is supposed to have a special<lb/>
place for it in the new building of the Mayo Clinic. The Librarian of the<lb/>
University of Virginia would be most happy to have it and one of the last<lb/>
times I was in Washington one of the Chief Custodians of the Library of<lb/>
Congress discussed the matter with me. Rest assured that all of this data<lb/>
will be kept in perpetuity. I have thought that if it were possible, when<lb/>
a final decision was made, I would try to have all the data microfilmed<lb/>
or photostated so that complete sets of copies would be available to<lb/>
the two institutions which did not receive the originals. In that way<lb/>
perhaps all could be suited.<lb/>
