<salute>Dear Clara, Richard, and George:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Betty reached home last night at 10:30, and we were indeed glad<lb/>
to see her. So you see this letter is addressed to the rest of our<lb/>
far-away children. We had much to talk about, and so we did not get to<lb/>
bed until after midnight. But we made up for it this morning, for<lb/>
breakfast was served for the two of us at 9 o'clock, and Betty had here<lb/>
in season to go to church with us. We went up to the First Congrega-<lb/>
tional Church in Hewton Center, and heard dear old Dr. Noyes preach<lb/>
his last sermon on The Christmas Angels. He has been here for 35 years.<lb/>
They gave him $26,600 as a parting gift, and made him Pastor Emeritus<lb/>
without duties. The church was founded in 1664, and in the 265 years<lb/>
of its history it has had only 10 Pastors. Dr. Noyes goes to Baytonia<lb/>
Beach, Florida to take charge of the Tourists' Church. That's the way<lb/>
to retire, I'll tell the woirld.</p>
<p>I suppose before this you have received my postal from Washington.<lb/>
After my nine lectures on Yellow Fever and on Flies and Mosquitoes Mother<lb/>
thought a sea trip to Baltimore would be a good thing for me, and it<lb/>
certainly was. I ate, and slept, and loafed the three days on the boat.<lb/>
I had a wonderful time with the Big Four Doctors in Baltimore who helped<lb/>
so much in getting the Yellow Fever Bill through Congress. I got well<lb/>
acqainted with Dr. Oliver, visited his office in the Criminal Courts<lb/>
Building, his Professional Office, Homewood, where he lives with the<lb/>
Johns Hopkins students, and attended the Anglican (High Episcopalian)<lb/>
Mass with him on Sunday morning. He is certainly a wonderful man.</p>
<p>Dr. Welch urged me to go on to Washington to see Secretary Mellon<lb/>
of the Treasury Department relative to the gold medals that are to be<lb/>
given to the 22 heroes next year. He was most cordial, and promised to<lb/>
make it his special interest to secure a wonderful piece of work. I<lb/>
had the good fortune to talk with Sec. Wilbur of the Interior Depart-<lb/>
ment, Surgeon General Ireland of the War Department, Surgeon General<lb/>
Cumming of the Public Health Service, Senators Copeland of New York and<lb/>
Senator Walsh of Mass., Congressmen Wainwright and Davenport of New<lb/>
York, Mrs. Rogers, Representative from Mass., Col. Kean, Mrs. Walter<lb/>
Reed and her beautiful Daughter, Blossom, and many others. I lectured<lb/>
for an hour and a half to a fine room-full of boys and girls in the<lb/>
big <unclear>HoKinley</unclear> High School in Washington, with Col. Kean present. He<lb/>
was in Cuba when the wonderful work was done in 1900, he gave me a few<lb/>
minor criticisms, and told me it was remarkable that a group of high<lb/>
school students would listen for 90 minutes to any lecture. Telegrams<lb/>
and letters called me to New York. Hunt and I begin work on the four<lb/>
books very soon. He takes a Sabbatical next term.</p>
<p>G. W. failed us on letter, but our ever faithful Dick is always on<lb/>
the job. Those Ithaca pictures are great! Hope there are more.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can read these if you place them over<lb/>
a sheet of white paper. <unclear>Je</unclear> Do not return</p>
<closer>
<salute>Much love from all,</salute>
