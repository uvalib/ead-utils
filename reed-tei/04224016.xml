Dr. Henry A. Christian<lb/>
20 Chapel Street<lb/>
Brookline 46, Massachusetts<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Christian:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you very much indeed for your courteous note regarding my little<lb/>
paper on Walter Reed and the Conquest of Yellow Fever. I gave this talk<lb/>
(illustrated) at the University of Virginia. They asked for a manuscript ahead<lb/>
of time for their college publicity and I didn't realize it was being published<lb/>
until I received the proof from Pharos. I had to make a few quick, minor cor-<lb/>
rections.</p>
<p>You may be interested to know that I made another trip to Cuba on my<lb/>
spring vacation and was finally successful in having the Cuban Government set<lb/>
aside a preliminary sum of $50,000 to memorialize Camp Lazear and the remains<lb/>
of Reed's Building Number One which they are going to enclose in a memorial<lb/>
building with suitable tablets, busts, etc., and also a great amount of souvenir<lb/>
data which I and others have collected. The whole adventure has been a very<lb/>
pleasant affair although at times quite exasperating because of the Cuban's<lb/>
characteristic of manana. Through this adventure I have gotten to know quite<lb/>
intimately the Reed family, General Ireland, General and Mrs. Kean and the<lb/>
Lazear family</p>
<p>I gave an abstract of this talk at the International Congress on<lb/>
Tropical Medicine a month ago in Washington and the following week went to New<lb/>
York for the unveiling of the Reed <unclear>statue</unclear> in the Hall of Fame. They published<lb/>
a very interesting little program, a copy of which I enclose. You may keep it<lb/>
if you wish.</p>
<p>It must have been indeed a pleasure for you to have known these men<lb/>
so intimately. I, of course, never met any of the four charter members, only the<lb/>
surviving relatives. Did you know that Mrs. Walter Reed is still living, or I<lb/>
should say existing, at the age of 90 something? I have seen her every now and<lb/>
then at her home at Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>I am glad to have your comments suggesting that Reed's accomplishment<lb/>
in graduating from the Medical School of the University of Virginia in one year<lb/>
was not as outstanding as some would have you believe. I suspected that was the<lb/>
case but naturally have never tried to belittle his accomplishment unduly, cer-<lb/>
tainly not at the University of Virginia where Reed is of course one of their<lb/>
favorite sons (my brother has been professor of English Literature there for many<lb/>
years). Again, let me thank you for your interest and comments in this little talk.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
