Albert E. Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco, California<lb/>
Annexure of addendum #2<lb/>
(in England) to by letter<lb/>
of Aug 29, 1941<lb/>
(started Aug 26<lb/>
<dateline>
<date value="1941-08-26">Aug. 26&sol;41</date>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been too busy lately<lb/>
to answer your letter of Aug 19 and<lb/>
the one of Aug 23 to Mr. Kellogg. (with<lb/>
a copy for me). I thought your comment<lb/>
in the latter were fine and fair to all<lb/>
concerned. In the<del>y</del> key to the painting<lb/>
I find no errors except that no. 12,<lb/>
Moran, was actually a civilian clerk<lb/>
at Gen. Lee's Headquarters and was<lb/>
not an acting Hospital Steward at that<lb/>
time as he did not re-enlist when<lb/>
his term as an <del><unclear>elisted</unclear></del> enlisted man<lb/>
expired several weeks before the Reed<lb/>
Board went to work in Cuba. I mentioned<lb/>
that in a letter to Mr. Kellogg to-day<lb/>
but suggested that no changes be made<lb/>
until you are consulted.</p>
<p>The nicely framed engineer's reproduction<lb/>
of the Y.F. painting came today and I<lb/>
was much pleased with it in every respect.<lb/>
I think Mr. Cornwell has produced a<lb/>
really fine painting and with the re-<lb/>
grouping, (since the first sketch I saw)<lb/>
my first objections have been removed<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06306051"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
2<lb/>
there is one small error which I<lb/>
mentioned to Mr Kellogg. Officers did<lb/>
<hi>not</hi> wear the silver cross on their<lb/>
campaign hats. The enlisted men were<lb/>
the only ones permitted to wear it.<lb/>
That can readily be corrected on the<lb/>
painting but probably not on the prints.</p>
<p>I also told Mr. K. that if they decided<lb/>
to put Ames in the picture it could be<lb/>
done without a stroke of the brush by<lb/>
simply designating the officer in white<lb/>
(on the porch) as Ames and the one in Khaki<lb/>
as Cooke. The one in white with the<lb/>
dark hair could readily pass for Ames<lb/>
and the one in from looks more like<lb/>
Cooke than the one in white does.</p>
<p>I was surprised that the medical History<lb/>
of the Post at Columbia Bks was such<lb/>
a &ldquo;<hi>dud</hi>&rdquo;. I really thought that Stark<lb/>
had written that up. He should have<lb/>
done so <add>starting</add> when the Board arrived and<lb/>
then reported progress from time to time.<lb/>
He was, however, completely absorbed<lb/>
in his surgical work and never did care<lb/>
for administrative work. You must see<lb/>
some of the old Medical Histories. At the<lb/>
Hospital, Governor's Island, N.Y. you<lb/>
will find a most interesting set of<lb/>
these old volumes and good accounts<lb/>
of yellow fever epidemics there, way<lb/>
back in the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century. At Ft Robinson<lb/>
Nebraska there are some old medical<lb/>
Histories with pages written by Walter Reed<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06306052"/>
3_<lb/>
when he was stationed there <add>Back in <del>the</del> 1880-90.</add> When<lb/>
you run out of work I suggest that<lb/>
you write to the Surgeon there and see<lb/>
if they can be located. They were in<lb/>
the attic of the hospital and not well<lb/>
cared for, but the War Dept. won't permit<lb/>
of their removal from the Post. Walter<lb/>
Reed's entries should be microfilmed or<lb/>
copied in some way. Have you read<lb/>
the book &ldquo;Old Jules&rdquo; by Mari Sondaz<lb/>
pub. by Little, Brown &amp; Co. 1935? It<lb/>
has a Photostat copy of one of Reed's<lb/>
letters from Ft Robinson dated, Feb. 12, 1885.</p>
<p>I will be glad to see your article<lb/>
in the Oct. Hygeia. Until recently I did not<lb/>
know that you made an address at<lb/>
the dedication of the painting. Could you<lb/>
spare me <hi>20</hi> of the reprints? I will<lb/>
be most interested, of course, and want<lb/>
to provide some of my old friends with<lb/>
copies. I will be glad to pay for them.</p>
<p>Yesterday I sent Kean my mmr.<lb/>
as recently revised. I had two carbons<lb/>
made this time and am circulating<lb/>
them again among the old timers<lb/>
to find all the errors possible. About<lb/>
three months ago I asked if you<lb/>
had written to Dr. Pinto after your<lb/>
return from Cuba without any word<lb/>
to me on the subject I finally wrote<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06306053"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
to him about two weeks ago and<lb/>
had a very cordial letter from him.<lb/>
So the second carbon went to him as<lb/>
I feel sure he can give me some<lb/>
real help on points which I am<lb/>
hazy about. In due time I will<lb/>
see that one of the copies comes to<lb/>
you and you will see that I have really<lb/>
worked on this one. The first was only<lb/>
a typed copy of my first ideas and<lb/>
should never have been typed in<lb/>
that shape. I am sorry that you put so<lb/>
much work on it, but after all it did<lb/>
have info. that you wanted, I think.</p>
<p>In a few days I will return your<lb/>
Bullard letter with comments.</p>
<p>Mrs Truby is in Phila. with one<lb/>
of our daughters who is due <hi>right<lb/>
now</hi> to become a mother. I am<lb/>
all on edge each time the phone<lb/>
on door bell rings, and have been<lb/>
for a week. It is <hi>something</hi> to<lb/>
become a <hi>grandpop</hi> at 70!</p>
<p>This is a messy and hasty letter<lb/>
but its the best I can do to_ night.</p>

<salute>Very Sincerely</salute>
