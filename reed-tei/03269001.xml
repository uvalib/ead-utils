<salute>Dear Mr. Moran:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>On December 22nd last I wrote letters to you and<lb/>
to John R. Kissinger to ask you both if you would be willing to talk<lb/>
to me about the parts you played in Walter Reed's yellow fever<lb/>
experiments in Havana in 1900. At the time I hoped to get away for<lb/>
a holiday about the 10th of this month and thought that, if you were<lb/>
willing to see me, I should go to Havana.</p>
<p>I have since seen Kissinger but I have not heard from you. I am<lb/>
writing you again, not so much to press you to see me if you are<lb/>
unwilling to talk as to put my point of view more clearly before you.<lb/>
I can well understand a man's not wanting to talk about himself to<lb/>
reporters. I am not quite a reporter, however, (though I used to be<lb/>
one) and, with the job I have in hand, I had much rather come as near as possible<lb/>
to what actually happened and to what the real characters were actually<lb/>
like than make up both characters and incidents for myself out of<lb/>
whole cloth. Both Kissinger and Colonel Truby helped me a great deal,<lb/>
but I feel that you, if you can see your way to it, can help me more than<lb/>
either.</p>
<p>I shall not leave New York for a couple of weeks. Then I am<lb/>
figuring on a postponed holiday in Mexico. If you will be good enough<lb/>
to drop me a line at this address it will help me to set my plans. I<lb/>
can, of course, go ahead and complete my job on my own. If there is a<lb/>
chance of seeing you, however, I should go to Mexico by boat and via<lb/>
Havana expressly to talk with you. I take this job very seriously.</p>
<p>I don't like to talk about myself any more, I gather, than you do.<lb/>
If, however, you will look up my record in Who's Who you may feel that<lb/>
this job will be decently done and that seeing me will not, in that sense,<lb/>
be an entire waste of time. I shall look forward to hearing from you.</p>
