Ancon, Isthmian Canal Zone,<lb/>
<date value="1905-06-01">June 1, 1905.</date>
</dateline>
<salute>My dear Colonel:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Today's yellow fever report from your office has just<lb/>
been handed to me.</p>
<p>I notice that since May 12th cases of yellow fever<lb/>
have occurred in four localities on the Isthmus, to wit:<lb/>
the City of Panama, Colon, Gorgona and Culebra.</p>
<p>I understand that the case at Gorgona on May 24th<lb/>
was the first one from that locality. It is not established that<lb/>
the man was infected at Gorgona as there was opportunity for him<lb/>
to be infected elsewhere.</p>
<p>The disturbing feature of the present situation is<lb/>
that opportunity has arisen for the mosquitoes to become infect-<lb/>
ed in four localities. It occurs to me that this may necessit-<lb/>
ate an expansion of your force and an increase of your facilit-<lb/>
ies for stamping out the disease. This thought presses home<lb/>
upon me by reason of the fact that J. B.J. Rensing, the American<lb/>
engineer at Culebra, was taken sick May 23rd but was not<lb/>
admitted to Ancon hospital until May 29th.</p>
<p>I understand it is difficult to recognize yellow<lb/>
fever in its early stages, and that in mild cases the difficulty<lb/>
continues for a longer period, and possibly this furnishes the<lb/>
explanation of the length of time between the initial period of<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02812002"/>
2.<lb/>
his illness and his admission to the hospital. But there are a<lb/>
great many non-immunes at Culebra, and I should like to be<lb/>
advised whether or not the condition requires an increase in<lb/>
the number of doctors stationed at that point in order that<lb/>
more frequent inspections and critical examinations may be made.</p>
<p>I have heretofore advised you, and I wish to repeat<lb/>
with added emphasis, that the entire resources available to the<lb/>
Isthmian Canal Commission, and the Government of the Canal Zone,<lb/>
are available to render you all possible assistance in the<lb/>
great work of eradicating yellow fever on the Isthmus and ex-<lb/>
pediting the accomplishment of proper sanitation. I know<lb/>
I voice the earnest conviction of the President and the Secreta-<lb/>
ry of War in saying that yellow fever must be eradicated and<lb/>
proper sanitation accomplished, if it is within the possibility<lb/>
of human endeavor. Money, means and men, to the extent of the<lb/>
Commission's ability to supply them, are at your disposal. We<lb/>
rely upon you to ascertain and determine what is required. By<lb/>
&ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the President, the Secretary of War, the Commission,<lb/>
and the people of the United States.</p>
<p>I do not consider the present situation unduly alar-<lb/>
ming, but think the present hazard much less than at several<lb/>
previous periods.</p>
<p>I am addressing you thus formally simply to put in<lb/>
writing what I have stated to you verbally, and to preclude<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02812003"/>
3.<lb/>
the possibility of there being any hesitation on your part in<lb/>
requesting extraordinary remedies now or at any time hereafter<lb/>
when you may think they are required.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute>
<signed>signed Charles E. <unclear>Magoon</unclear><lb/>
