<title>Letter from J.F. Siler to Philip Showalter Hench, January 21, 1952</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Siler discusses the possibility of establishing a permanent exhibit of Walter Reed material, as well as the pros and cons of placing it at the Walter Reed Medical Center or the Army Medical Museum. Hench would be of great help in selecting material to be used in an exhibit. He hopes Hench's Cuba trip will result in the Cuban government furnishing funds for the preservation of Building No. 1.</p>

SECRETARY<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wish first to apologize most humbly for my apparent neglect in<lb/>
replying to your letters in the past month or so.</p>
<p>Doubtless you did receive the minutes of the annual meeting of the<lb/>
Walter Reed Memorial Association Board of Managers and noted that there was<lb/>
no important business transacted.</p>
<p>I would like to say, however, relative to the question of establishing<lb/>
a <hi>permanent exhibit of Walter Reed material here</hi> in Washington that I have<lb/>
talked this matter over with the Commanding Officer of Walter Reed Hospital<lb/>
and with the Museum people here. They did have a small exhibit at the Mus-<lb/>
eum during the period of the celebration of the hundredth anniversary of<lb/>
Reed's birth. As you possibly know, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathol-<lb/>
ogy is to be moved out to Walter Reed Medical Center. Funds already have<lb/>
been provided for construction of a building but active construction is<lb/>
being held up because of the shortage of materials. The question that we<lb/>
should consider would be whether, in the event that a permanent exhibit is<lb/>
prepared, it should be placed in the Institute of Pathology at Walter Reed<lb/>
Medical Center or in the Army Medical Museum down on Constitution Avenue.<lb/>
The present museum is of course very old and doubtless will be replaced at<lb/>
some future time. It is probable that more people would see such an exhibit<lb/>
if it were located here in the city rather than at Walter Reed.</p>
<p>I hope you will give this matter your consideration. There is no<lb/>
hurry about deciding on the matter but it might be well to take some action<lb/>
<hi>at the next annual meeting.</hi></p>
<p>The second point, of course, is the question of collecting material for<lb/>
such an exhibit. There is very little material available here but I have<lb/>
no doubt that you can be of great help in selecting material to be used in<lb/>
such an exhibit.</p>
<p>As I recall, it is your intention to visit Cuba in the near future. I<lb/>
do hope so much that you will be able to make some headway in getting the<lb/>
Cuban Government to furnish funds for the preservation of the building used<lb/>
by Reed in his transmission experiments.</p>

<p>The Christmas holidays were ruined for the Siler family this year because<lb/>
we both had virus pneumonia and are just now recovering from it.</p>
<p>With very best regards and all good wishes for the year ahead,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
