<p>FAME OF REED AND GORGAS</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Credit to the One for a Great Medical Discovery and<lb/>
to the Other for a Great Feat<lb/>
of Sanitation</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">To the Editor of The New York Times:</hi></p>
<p>In June, 1902, President Charles W.<lb/>
Eliot of Harvard University gave to<lb/>
Major Walter Reed the honorary degree<lb/>
of M. A. with the citation, &ldquo;he gave to<lb/>
man control over that dreadful plague,<lb/>
yellow fever.&rdquo; This is the inscription<lb/>
on Reed's tombstone in Arlington Ceme-<lb/>
tery and its truth has not been chal-<lb/>
lenged until now. Therefore the friends<lb/>
of Reed and Gorgas and persons inter-<lb/>
ested in the history of medicine have<lb/>
been surprised recently to see what was<lb/>
the crowning accomplishment of Reed's<lb/>
life, the demonstration that the stego-<lb/>
myia mosquito was the infecting agent<lb/>
of yellow fever and the only one<lb/>
claimed for another and that other<lb/>
Gorgas.</p>
<p>In a very clever and entertaining<lb/>
article in a current magazine, &ldquo;Yellow<lb/>
Fever Meets its Master,&rdquo; by Marie<lb/>
Doughty Gorgas and Burton J. Hen-<lb/>
drick, occurs the statement, &ldquo;Even when<lb/>
Reed had completed his work Gorgas's<lb/>
position was still one of extreme caution.<lb/>
That the stegomyia mosquito could<lb/>
transmit the disease was unassailably<lb/>
proved; but was this the only way in<lb/>
which it could be conveyed? Was it<lb/>
even the ordinary way? That, Gorgas<lb/>
held, had not been demonstrated. * * *<lb/>
In the next few months, however, it was<lb/>
clearly to be shown that the stegomyia<lb/>
and the stegomyia only, was the infect-<lb/>
ing agent, and the man who was to<lb/>
make this clear for all time was Gorgas<lb/>
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement arrived at its conclu-<lb/>
sion by ignoring the admirable and con-<lb/>
vincing series of experiments of Reed<lb/>
with infected bedding and clothing and<lb/>
with the discharges from patients,<lb/>
which made it as clear as the noonday<lb/>
that the stegomyia was the ordinary<lb/>
and the only normal way of transmit-<lb/>
ting the disease. If these experiments<lb/>
did not convince Gorgas, neither could<lb/>
conviction be drawn from his own ex-<lb/>
perience in the next few months, for he<lb/>
continued, until the middle of August,<lb/>
1901, the disinfection of bedding and<lb/>
clothing of yellow fever cases, which<lb/>
Reed had shown to be unnecessary.</p>
<p>This claim is introductory to a state-<lb/>
ment in the beginning of the fourth<lb/>
chapter which is equally erroneous. It<lb/>
is that Reed's demonstration was a<lb/>
mere academic performance which Reed<lb/>
himself saw no practical way of apply-<lb/>
ing. The intimation clearly is that the<lb/>
methods of warfare against the mos-<lb/>
quito were unknown until devised and<lb/>
put into operation by Gorgas about<lb/>
Feb. 15, 1901. This is, however, far<lb/>
from being the fact, The writings of the<lb/>
distinguished entomologist, L. O. How-<lb/>
ard, had made the use of kerosene to<lb/>
control mosquito breeding well known<lb/>
to army sanitarians. Under the stimu-<lb/>
lation of Reed's influence the chief<lb/>
surgeon of the Department of Western<lb/>
Cuba had, on Oct. 15, 1900, three<lb/>
months before the acceptance by Gor-<lb/>
gas of the mosquito theory, published a<lb/>
circular to medical officers calling at-<lb/>
tention to the fact that mosquitos were<lb/>
known to convey malaria and filarial<lb/>
disease and were suspected of conveying<lb/>
yellow fever also, and directing the pre-<lb/>
vention of mosquito breeding by the use<lb/>
of kerosene on deposits of water. On<lb/>
Dec. 21, 1900, still before the conver-<lb/>
sion of Gorgas, General Order No. 6<lb/>
was issued from General Leonard<lb/>
Wood's headquarters directing, with<lb/>
minuteness of detail, the warfare<lb/>
against mosquitos. As Gorgas began to<lb/>
put in practice two months later the<lb/>
procedures specified in this order, it<lb/>
cannot be claimed that he was the dis-<lb/>
coverer of anything not already known.</p>
<p>The general order above mentioned<lb/>
was published in Ha<del>r</del>vard's "Military<lb/>
Hygiene," second editon, William Wood<lb/>
&amp; Co. What he, Gorgas, did do is well<lb/>
stated in a letter he wrote to Reed,<lb/>
dated Aug. 20, 1901, in which he says<lb/>
"I am very happy to shine in the more<lb/>
humble role of being the first to put<lb/>
your discovery to extensive practical ap-<lb/>
plication."</p>
<p>The fame of Gorgas is secure in the<lb/>
performance of the greatest feat of san-<lb/>
itary administration that the world has<lb/>
seen. It does not need augmentation by<lb/>
claiming for him what belongs to his<lb/>
brilliant and unrewarded friend, Walter<lb/>
Reed.</p>
