<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>This afternoon, we<lb/>
made a journey to the top of Arthur's Seat.<lb/>
It is really quite a climb and is<lb/>
much farther from town than I had<lb/>
supposed. It was raining as usual<lb/>
so the view was limited but it<lb/>
was still very beautiful<del>l</del>.<lb/>
Edinburgh lies just to the west and<lb/>
to the <add>north</add> lies the Firth of Forth stretching<lb/>
eastward to the North Sea. In all<lb/>
other directions you see a landscape<lb/>
of hills and valleys. Between Arthur's<lb/>
Seat and the city there is another<lb/>
high hill called Salisburg Craig.<lb/>
Just at the foot and near Holyrood<lb/>
there is Saint Anthony's chapel and well<lb/>
neither of which amounts to much.<lb/>
Holyrood Palace itself is a disap-<lb/>
pointment in its outside view (I have<lb/>
not yet seen the interior). It is a dingy<lb/>
barracks looking place. To tell the<lb/>
truth Edinburgh must certainly be called<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00133002"/>
dingy as a whole. There is always<lb/>
a cloud of smoke hanging over<lb/>
and whenever you leave a window<lb/>
open you find a pile of soot<lb/>
on the sill. For all that<lb/>
it is a beautiful town, there<lb/>
is harmony about the general<lb/>
architecture that we do not<lb/>
see in America.</p>
<p>The people here are an odd lot.<lb/>
They are nearly all devout Presbyterians<lb/>
They attend church regularly about<lb/>
five times every Sunday and I<lb/>
don't know how many times during<lb/>
the week. They are not given to<lb/>
swearing, they seem to make a<lb/>
special point against profanity.<lb/>
I don't think I have heard an<lb/>
oath since I got here. All this is<lb/>
in their favor, but I never saw such<lb/>
a place for drunkenness in my<lb/>
life. You see men and women<lb/>
fall down in the principal streets<lb/>
at all hours of day or night and<lb/>
nobody seems to think anything of it.<lb/>
They get beastly drunk, you don't<lb/>
see them just mildly <del>I</del> intoxicated<lb/>
but they all seem just on the<lb/>
borders of collapse. I took<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00133003"/>
3<lb/>
a walk, last night and really<lb/>
about nine in every ten persons<lb/>
I met, were drunk.</p>
<p>Last night I went to the Royal Circus<lb/>
to see Sampson, the strong man. His<lb/>
performance was very good, but<lb/>
the rest of the show amounted to<lb/>
nothing, so we left as soon<lb/>
as Sampson had finished his<lb/>
act.</p>
<p>Tuesday June 10</p>
<p>I had hoped to get a letter from<lb/>
you today as this is one of the American<lb/>
mail days but none came.</p>
<p>This afternoon Stanley was given<lb/>
the degree of L.L.D. by the University.<lb/>
The ceremony look place in the<lb/>
library which is not large enough<lb/>
to hold all the students so we<lb/>
gathered in the quadrangle to<lb/>
see the party go in. While I<lb/>
was standing there the curator<lb/>
of the Museum came up to me<lb/>
and offered me a ticket of admission<lb/>
to the hall. He said he had seen<lb/>
plenty of graduations and did not care<lb/>
to go in. It was very kind of him.<lb/>
I notice a disposition on the part of<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00133004"/>
all the instructors and officers to<lb/>
be especially kind to us Americans.<lb/>
Well I went in <del>in</del> and saw the<lb/>
ceremony which was very simple.<lb/>
The Big Guns of the University were<lb/>
on a platform dressed in brilliant<lb/>
robes, each seemed to have different<lb/>
colors. One of them got up and<lb/>
<del>made</del> made a very few remarks and<lb/>
another placed the cap on Stanley's<lb/>
head. Then Stanley made an address<lb/>
which for egotism stands way over<lb/>
anything I ever heard of. He held<lb/>
himself up as the great model of the<lb/>
universe.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon as I was<lb/>
dissecting, Dr Hepburn walked<lb/>
up and introduced an old white<lb/>
haired gentleman who turned<lb/>
out to be the great Sir William<lb/>
Turner, the professor of Anatomy. He<lb/>
had just returned from London<lb/>
where he had been attending<lb/>
the Medical Council. He talked<lb/>
very pleasantly for a few minutes<lb/>
and I really did not feel much<lb/>
abashed at my first contact<lb/>
with the nobility. They say he<lb/>
takes great interest in the students<lb/>
work and frequently comes into<lb/>
the dissecting room and walks<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00133005"/>
5<lb/>
around the room taking scalpel<lb/>
&amp; forceps and giving points to the<lb/>
students. It is a very unusual<lb/>
thing for a head professor to do<lb/>
like that, most of them never<lb/>
enter the dissecting room.</p>
<p>The students here are much more<lb/>
noisy than American students. When<lb/>
we were all in the Quadrangle<lb/>
the instructors etc passed in, those<lb/>
<del>whom</del> who were popular were loudly<lb/>
cheers, while the examiners were<lb/>
all hooted. The hooting was a<lb/>
new thing to me. The Americans<lb/>
express displeasure by silence<lb/>
while the Britons hoots and groans.<lb/>
The noise they make is very well<lb/>
expressed by the word h-o-o-t,<lb/>
At the opera the students all<lb/>
sit in the gallery and sing<lb/>
for half-an-hour before the<lb/>
performance begins and again<lb/>
between the acts. I have not<lb/>
yet heard them but they say<lb/>
they sing excellently.</p>
<p>I bought a copy of the Heart<lb/>
of Mid-Lothian this afternoon<lb/>
which I am going to read.<lb/>
So this book will be published<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00133006"/>
bought and read in Edinburgh,<lb/>
and as the story is about<lb/>
Edinburgh and by a man who<lb/>
lived in Edinburgh, it will make<lb/>
a good souvenir of my visit<lb/>
here. I saw the heart in<lb/>
the <del><unclear>side</unclear></del> street crossing, the<lb/>
other day, which marks the<lb/>
site of the old Tolbooth,</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
<p><del><unclear>s</unclear></del></p>
