Reservations Manager<lb/>
Hotel Nacional<lb/>
Havana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Doctor and Mrs. Howard Gray, Mrs. Hench and I expect to arrive in Havana<lb/>
Sunday morning, January 20, by the over-night boat from Miami and wish to<lb/>
spend a week or so at the Hotel Nacional, probably leaving the hotel<lb/>
Sunday, January 27, for a few days at Varadero Beach.</p>
<p>I have been invited to participate in a medical congress to be held at<lb/>
Havana the week of January 20. I understand that the University of<lb/>
Havana is arranging this congress, although my invitation came from<lb/>
Dr. Tom D. Spies of Birmingham, Alabama, who travels to Havana every<lb/>
few weeks to carry on some work at the University Hospital in Havana.<lb/>
Doctor Spies and I have been having some correspondence regarding this<lb/>
matter and three or four weeks ago he assured me that he or one of his<lb/>
friends in Havana would make reservations for us at the Hotel Nacional<lb/>
for the week of January 20. However as I have heard nothing definite, I<lb/>
think I had better write you directly about this.</p>
<p>Doctor and Mrs. Gray and the Henches would like, if possible, two nice<lb/>
twin bed rooms each with bath. It would be very pleasant and comfortable<lb/>
for us if we could have connecting rooms. I have had the pleasure of<lb/>
visiting your hotel on several occasions, but this is the first trip for<lb/>
Doctor and Mrs. Gray; therefore I think it would be nice if we could have<lb/>
rooms facing the ocean. We are physicians and therefore would like<lb/>
moderate priced rooms, not your most expensive rooms.</p>
<p>Would it be possible for us now to engage a cabana at the swimming pool?<lb/>
Although I shall be attending medical meetings, the ladies will probably<lb/>
spend much time at the pool. On my last visit to your hotel there were<lb/>
no cabanas available when I tried to rent one after we got there.</p>
<p>Will you kindly let us know the approximate rate of our rooms and one cabana<lb/>
for a week and confirm this reservation directly to me?</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
