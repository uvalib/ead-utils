<salute>My Dear Daughter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I sent your other letter<lb/>
Ashore this morning. Had I<lb/>
known, I had saved a day<lb/>
because the <del>P</del> Key West<lb/>
S. S. leaves at <hi>10 A. M.</hi> &amp; I<lb/>
could have taken it over<lb/>
to her &amp; it had gone off<lb/>
this morning instead of<lb/>
tomorrow- A day's delay<lb/>
makes<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00822033"/>
2<lb/>
no difference about your letter, but it may make a dif-<lb/>
ference in Lyster's paper - as he may send it on for pub-<lb/>
lication before he gets the corrections, for which <hi>he</hi>, at<lb/>
least, should be sorry:</p>
<p>(1) I see in the paper today - that poor Gorgas has had a stroke<lb/>
of apoplexy &amp; has had to give up the African work. <del>In</del><lb/>
I am grievously sorry <hi>for him</hi>. Frankly I don't think he was in<lb/>
<del>a</del> proper condition to do his best - and it is the truth - <hi>good</hi><lb/>
work when I last saw him. I wish he had talked over his<lb/>
plans, with me or with anyone competent to discuss them.<lb/>
I mean his <hi>general</hi> plans &amp; the detail of carrying them out<lb/>
When I saw him at Payta - only for an hour &amp; a half it is true<lb/>
- he<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00822034"/>
3<lb/>
he <hi>had</hi> no plans for Peru.<lb/>
Of course he was tired &amp; I presume<lb/>
feeling badly from the sea - al<lb/>
though it was dead smooth &amp;<lb/>
the <unclear>Huasco</unclear> is a large ship -<lb/>
yet he evidently had not<lb/>
formulated <hi>any</hi> plan - gen<lb/>
eral or in detail. A clearly for-<lb/>
<unclear>#</unclear><lb/>
mulated plan of action - sub-<lb/>
ject to change of course - is to<lb/>
my mind essential in any<lb/>
large undertaking - especially<lb/>
for<lb/>

<p>(2) Guiteras left 14 days ago &amp;<lb/>
- has not been heard from since</p>
<p>(3) I went to see Frank <unclear>Menocal</unclear><lb/>
- in charge of Maritime Q. - &amp;<lb/>
found him very glad to see<lb/>
me. We are going tomor-<lb/>
row to look over his Q. station<lb/>
- at <unclear>Triscenia</unclear> &amp; afterward<lb/>
have <del>dinn</del> breakfast to-<lb/>

Colonel Havard - a retired offi-<lb/>
cer of the U.S. <del>Med</del> Med-<lb/>
Corps. who was chief surgeon<lb/>
of the Island of Cuba in <hi>1900.</hi><lb/>
&amp; my very good friend. We<lb/>
roomed in the same house<lb/>
- we two <hi>only</hi> in &ldquo;Chaffee's Pal-<lb/>
ace&rdquo; <del>-</del> which had <hi>16 bed rooms.</hi><lb/>
&amp; for which the U.S. Paid $6000<lb/>
for annum rent. He is<lb/>
Med. Inspector General of<lb/>
the Cuban Army now.<lb/>

6<lb/>
<del><unclear>or</unclear></del><lb/>
He retired in 1907 - but<lb/>
came back in service du-<lb/>
ring the war. A. French-<lb/>
man - from South France - as<lb/>
indeed are all the <del>&ldquo;ards</del><lb/>
- &ldquo;Ards&rdquo; - (Brevard: Bayard:<lb/>
Archivard etc). Refugeed after<lb/>
the Franco-Prussian war &amp;<lb/>
entered the U.S. Army- <del>I's</del><lb/>
Was a Prof. of Botany- Is<lb/>
about 77 or 8 years old.<lb/>
A great Botanist - which<lb/>
was<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f00822038"/>
7<lb/>
was our first bond of Union.</p>
<p>I didn't see him today - as<lb/>
he was sick- If <unclear>he he</unclear> still<lb/>
sick to<del>day</del>morrow I will go out<lb/>
to see him: I know where he<lb/>
lives- I <hi>think</hi> I will also call<lb/>
on Mrs Guiteras - whom I have<lb/>
never met - although I am<lb/>
told she sees no one. She is<lb/>
at Las Animas Hospital<lb/>
- where they have quarters-<lb/>
If she can't - or won't see me<lb/>
well<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f00822039"/>
8<lb/>
<unclear>8</unclear><lb/>
Well but if she would &amp; I did<lb/>
not call it <del>now</del> might hurt<lb/>
Guiteras.</p>
<p>3) Another thing &amp; one of which<lb/>
you will approve- I took<lb/>
breakfast - by myself - at the<lb/>
Dos Hermanos, &amp; &ldquo;blew my-<lb/>
self&rdquo;- Langustinos (broiled)<lb/>
Arroz con pollio: &amp; for postres<lb/>
Jalea de Guayaba y Queso-<lb/>
Crema del Norte - &amp; a cup of<lb/>
black coffee which was simply<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f00822040"/>
9<lb/>
delicious. It had been much<lb/>
better with a glass of <unclear>Rioga</unclear><lb/>
UNITED FRUIT COMPANY<lb/>
STEAMSHIP SERVICE<lb/>
<unclear>Clarete</unclear> - but I feel bound to<lb/>
drink nothing while I am in<lb/>
the service - to July <hi>20</hi> - at any<lb/>
rate. Still it was the most<lb/>
satisfactory meal I have had<lb/>
for a long time - delicious<lb/>
<unclear>Spanish</unclear> head.</p>
<p>Later<lb/>
Drs <unclear>Torralbos</unclear> &amp; Sanchez <unclear>Agra-<lb/>
monte</unclear> came out to the S. S.<lb/>
to Call - both were in my service<lb/>

H.S. office &amp; the other two, de<lb/>
Soto. &amp; Espinosa in the Im-<lb/>
migration - all knew me.<lb/>
&amp; were apparently very glad<lb/>
to see me. This witnesseth;</p>
<p>(1) I chose &amp; trained satisfactory<lb/>
men.</p>

reasons in the Sanitary De-<lb/>

<p>I took <del>dinner</del><add>breakfast</add> with Dr<lb/>
Menocal yesterday &amp; din-<lb/>
ner with Dr Wilson - of San-<lb/>
tiago- The two were too much<lb/>
for me &amp; I am feeling &ldquo;bum&rdquo;<lb/>
this morning. Took no wine<lb/>
&amp; did not eat much either,<lb/>
probably too much coffee.</p>
<p>Saw - at his request - General<lb/>
Mario Menocal, the President,<lb/>
<pb n="13" id="f00822044"/>
&amp; had an interesting talk<lb/>
with him.</p>
<p>Also went out - with Havard<lb/>
&amp; called on Mrs Guiteras<lb/>
at Las Animas, Hospital.<lb/>
To my surprise she rec'd<lb/>
me &amp; we had quite a talk<lb/>
- she speaks no English - main-<lb/>
ly about <hi>you</hi> &amp; her dead<lb/>
daughter, Miss Guiteras<lb/>
- his sister - came in later<lb/>
&amp; she talked of your book - Gui-<lb/>
teras has evidently told them<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f00822045"/>
much of you: I am re-<lb/>
turning to Las Animas<lb/>
this morning to see what<lb/>
<unclear>Lchedo</unclear> has to show me<lb/>
of the <unclear>Leptospira icteroi-<lb/>
des:</unclear> <hi>but</hi> - I am not go-<lb/>
ing to take dinner ashore<lb/>
<hi>with anyone</hi>, I will have<lb/>
take breakfast- I am afraid<lb/>
of the return of my <del><unclear>trunk</unclear></del><lb/>
&ldquo;Kink&rdquo; trouble.</p>
<p>I think the enclosed dates<lb/>
came<lb/>
<pb n="15" id="f00822046"/>
came from Dr (Francisco)<lb/>
Menocal.</p>
<p>I <hi>may</hi> have a chance to<lb/>
write tonight - we leave<lb/>
tomorrow at 8 A.M. but I<lb/>
doubt it</p>
