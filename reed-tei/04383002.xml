Dr. W. Edwin Hemphill<lb/>
Head, History Division<lb/>
Virginia State Library<lb/>
Richmond 19, Virginia<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Hemphill:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have asked our Photographic Department to prepare an 8" by 10"<lb/>
glossy print of Walter Reed's medical diploma from the University<lb/>
of Virginia; also glossy prints of Walter Reed's birthplace before<lb/>
and after it was fixed up. The latter two are copies of either<lb/>
post cards or small photographs that were sent to me by someone and<lb/>
may be what you already have. If you do not use them, please return<lb/>
them to me. Our Photographic Department expects to have them finished<lb/>
by Monday and I will mail them to you then.</p>
<p>In regard to the credit line under the photograph of Reed's diploma,<lb/>
perhaps it might be best to say &ldquo;The Reed Family through Dr. P. S.<lb/>
Hench.&rdquo; I never quite know what to do about such a matter. On a<lb/>
number of occasions I have suggested the following credit lines:<lb/>
&ldquo;Mrs. Walter Reed&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mrs. Walter Reed and Dr. P. S. Hench,&rdquo; but<lb/>
Mrs. Reed is now dead, she died last year. The reason I did this in<lb/>
the past was to relieve her of letters of inquiry or requests re-<lb/>
garding photographs. General Reed, the son, is as you may know, a<lb/>
quiet retiring man who simply hates to write letters and unless the<lb/>
matter is a special one he rarely answers them. The many photographs,<lb/>
letters and documents which the Reed family gave me they gave me out-<lb/>
right, but of course with the understanding that they were to be part<lb/>
of a large collection of which I was to be the custodian, which of<lb/>
course would be kept together and not sold and I have been the one to<lb/>
decide which requests for data it was proper for me to grant, etc.<lb/>
Naturally, I feel a great responsibility in this matter and want to be<lb/>
as helpful as possible, but of course there are certain things that I<lb/>
want to keep and not publish until my own book on the subject comes out.<lb/>
I shall be glad to have your own ideas as to the matter of the credit<lb/>
line and I notice the credit lines in your magazine are not under the<lb/>
photographs but on the back of the cover page. That is certainly all<lb/>
right with me.</p>
<p>Would you send me a copy of your article when it is published? I am sure<lb/>
that Walter Reed's daughter and son would like to have copies also and if<lb/>
you will send them to me I will forward them, or perhaps you may wish to<lb/>
send them directly.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M.D.</signed>

P.S.: Since dictating the above letter I have discussed the above matter<lb/>
with Dr. James Eckman, Head of our Editorial Department. He thinks that the<lb/>
credit line &ldquo;The Reed Family through Dr. P. S. Hench&rdquo; would be appropriate.<lb/>
