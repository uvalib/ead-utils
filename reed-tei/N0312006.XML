<p>BACKGROUND OF EVENTS</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">BY PAUL V. COLLINS</hi>.</p>
<p>A tiger recently captured in Africa<lb/>
and carried to Paris broke bounds in<lb/>
the city and escaped to the Bois de<lb/>
Boulogne. It created a panic in the<lb/>
park and thousands of people fled.<lb/>
After a hunt by hundreds of men, the<lb/>
tiger was shot.</p>
<p>A writer who visited India reported<lb/>
that for every victim slain there by<lb/>
tigers and other great beasts thou-<lb/>
sands have been killed by mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The daughter of one of the scientists<lb/>
who were with Gen. Gorgas in fight-<lb/>
ing pests at Panama while digging the<lb/>
Canal was cautioned by her scientific<lb/>
father as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, if you should see a tiger<lb/>
in the woods, you had better return<lb/>
home promptly, but if you ever see<lb/>
one of the deadly mosquitoes, run as<lb/>
fast as you can and shut up all the<lb/>
screens tight. Don't ever let a mos-<lb/>
quito get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>Last week a great swarm of mos-<lb/>
quitoes from New Jersey invaded<lb/>
New York. There they attacked the<lb/>
City Hall, where the office holders and<lb/>
other redoubtable fighters most do<lb/>
congregate, and the attack was so<lb/>
overwhelming that the defenders were<lb/>
routed and put into as great a panic<lb/>
as were the Parisians who fled from<lb/>
the Bois de Boulogne tiger. The<lb/>
ferocious mosquitoes took possession<lb/>
of the City Hall, and it was with dif-<lb/>
ficulty that they were dispossessed the<lb/>
next day. The invaders were a thou-<lb/>
sand times more terrifying than the<lb/>
Tammany Tiger would have been, for<lb/>
New Yorkers are accustomed to twist<lb/>
the tail of that beast.</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>Dr. Howard, chief entomologist of<lb/>
the Department of Agriculture, says<lb/>
that he does not fear mosquitoes in<lb/>
his own home enough to provide<lb/>
screens to keep them out, for, he says,<lb/>
if anybody is troubled in Washington<lb/>
with mosquitoes it is his own fault.<lb/>
Every householder can destroy all<lb/>
mosquitoes in his own neighborhood.<lb/>
He expresses amazement that three<lb/>
years ago the manufacturers of wire<lb/>
screens confessed that they had sold,<lb/>
in rolls; screening to the amount of<lb/>
$30,000,000. Dr. Howard thinks it<lb/>
would be cheaper to attack the mos-<lb/>
quitoes at their source.</p>
<p>For example, New Jersey, growing<lb/>
tired of the antique jokes about her<lb/>
monster mosquitoes, began appropriat-<lb/>
ing from $200,000 to $300,000 a year,<lb/>
in co-operation with local communities<lb/>
or townships appropriating a propor-<lb/>
tionate amount, for the purpose of<lb/>
fighting the pests. As a result of that<lb/>
work the taxable valuation of real es-<lb/>
tate has increased many times the an-<lb/>
nual appropriation. The same might<lb/>
be done in all the coast States.</p>
<p>The statement that each household-<lb/>
er can clear his own environment of<lb/>
mosquitoes does not apply to the Jer-<lb/>
sey swamp variety, but to the locally<lb/>
prevalent kinds, which breed in the<lb/>
gutters of roofs, where water stands,<lb/>
or in dead leaves in the roof gutters,<lb/>
or in any stagnant water, such as bird<lb/>
fountains, basins for watering poultry<lb/>
or dogs, or in even bits of broken bot-<lb/>
tles which catch a little water. Such<lb/>
mosquitoes breed by the hundreds,<lb/>
daily, in a pint of stagnant water, and<lb/>
they never fly more than 100 yards<lb/>
from their breeding place. A cup of<lb/>
water indoors may become a hotbed<lb/>
of mosquitoes, even though it be hid in<lb/>
a closet or cellar. A vase for flowers<lb/>
holding water may be a pesthole for<lb/>
mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Where there is no standing water,<lb/>
certain varieties of mosquitoes de-<lb/>
posit their eggs in hollow spots in<lb/>
the dry ground, trusting to the snows<lb/>
of the following Winter to fill the<lb/>
holes, and then in Spring to melt and<lb/>
supply the proper breeding ground.<lb/>
When these breeding places are about<lb/>
Summer resorts which do not open<lb/>
up until July the new mosquitoes ar-<lb/>
rive before the resorter does. The<lb/>
time to destroy them is in the Spring,<lb/>
while the snow is melting. A few<lb/>
drops of kerosene sprayed over the<lb/>
little pools of water will rid the local-<lb/>
ity for all the Summer.</p>
<p>Any mosquito may travel long dis-<lb/>
tances when carried in automobiles<lb/>
or trains, or blown by strong winds.</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>It is popularly supposed that much<lb/>
rain insures abundance of mosquitoes,<lb/>
but the contrary is true. For ex-<lb/>
ample, Washington has had abun-<lb/>
dance of rain this Summer, but com-<lb/>
paratively few mosquitoes. This is<lb/>
because the rain washes down the<lb/>
sewers and the roof gutters and pre-<lb/>
vents water standing long enough to<lb/>
hatch the eggs laid therein.</p>
<p>In Louisiana a marsh has been<lb/>
sprayed from an airplane with arse-<lb/>
nate of lime, mixed with the dust of<lb/>
the road. In the test there were first<lb/>
placed basins of water into which<lb/>
larvae were put. These basins were<lb/>
located in various parts of the marsh,<lb/>
and the spraying was found to have<lb/>
killed all the larvae in all the basins.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic laymen, basing their<lb/>
conclusions upon that test, have pro-<lb/>
posed that President Coolidge insti-<lb/>
tute a movement nationwide for<lb/>
spraying from airplanes or airships<lb/>
the entire continental United States<lb/>
so as to rid the continent of all mos-<lb/>
quitoes. Scentists say that such a<lb/>
campaign would be needless and fu-<lb/>
tile, for only the malarial and the<lb/>
yellow fever and dengue mosquito<lb/>
travel any distance from their breed-<lb/>
ing grounds; so the annihilation of<lb/>
the others is a matter of local atten-<lb/>
tion.</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>The anopheles mosquito, which con-<lb/>
veys malaria, breeds only in clean wa-<lb/>
ter, preferably with grass growing in<lb/>
it. A bite from an anopheles results<lb/>
in injecting into man's blood a para-<lb/>
site which causes malaria. Quoting<lb/>
from a pamphlet by Dr. H. R. Carter,<lb/>
senior surgeon of the United States<lb/>
Public Health Service:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parasites which she injects en-<lb/>
ter the red blood cells. They are then<lb/>
extremely small. They grow by feed-<lb/>
ing on the blood cells and get bigger<lb/>
and bigger. Then their edges become<lb/>
scalloped and they divide into a num-<lb/>
ber of wedge-shaped pieces, meeting<lb/>
in the middle like a piece of pie. The<lb/>
blood cells break up and set the young<lb/>
parasites free, and each one of them<lb/>
starts off as a new parasite on its own<lb/>
account and tries to enter another red<lb/>
blood cell and repeat the process of<lb/>
its mother parasite. There are three<lb/>
kinds of parasites, causing different<lb/>
kinds of malarial fever. * * * It is<lb/>
estimated that at least 150,000,000 of<lb/>
parasites must divide at the same time<lb/>
to liberate enough poison to produce a<lb/>
chill--generally many times more than<lb/>
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientist describes the further<lb/>
process of spreading the malarial fe-<lb/>
ver as follows: The man who has the<lb/>
fever is bitten by another mosquito,<lb/>
which sucks from his blood many of<lb/>
the malarial parasites. These pass into<lb/>
the stomach of the biting mosquito,<lb/>
and if both sexes are thus taken to-<lb/>
gether into the stomach of the mos-<lb/>
quito they there breed millions more<lb/>
parasites, which in due time rise to<lb/>
the saliva of their host, the mosquito.<lb/>
If, then, that poisoned saliva enters a<lb/>
human victim by his being bitten by<lb/>
the mosquito, a new case of malarial<lb/>
fever results--another source of para-<lb/>
sites to feast upon red corpuscles and<lb/>
weaken the victim while adding mil-<lb/>
lions more parasites. In the same<lb/>
way yellow fever is spread by the<lb/>
means of the bites of parasite-infected<lb/>
mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Goldfish and surface minnows eat<lb/>
the larvae in the water. In Texas a<lb/>
breeder of bats claims that if we mul-<lb/>
tiply bats they will destroy all mos-<lb/>
quitoes, but Dr. Howard, the ento-<lb/>
mologist, says he has no faith in bats<lb/>
or insectivorous birds. There are<lb/>
some people who would prefer mos-<lb/>
quitoes to bats, for the latter, too, har-<lb/>
bor parasites.</p>
