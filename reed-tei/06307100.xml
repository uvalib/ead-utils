<p>Kean makes a few suggestions on how to improve Truby's forward. He notes that he was on an inspection tour during Lazear's illness. He returned and thinks he saw Lazear the day before he died. He does not know when Reed heard of Lazear's death.</p>

<salute>My dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am somewhat short of suitable paper myself<lb/>
and will fall back on the T. J. memo - as <add>it</add> has besides<lb/>
suitable envelopes for a real correspondence like<lb/>
ours- My last letter of the 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> had not arrived<lb/>
when yours of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> came this morning. I had under<lb/>
the agenda in my Scribble-In book to write to<lb/>
you and return your preface- I have read it over<lb/>
at different times and find that it is so perfectly<lb/>
appropriate that I cannot improve it- I have<lb/>
as you see made a few trifling suggestions to<lb/>
reduce the number of times that the pronoun of the<lb/>
first person naturally occurs in a preface, which<lb/>
is addressed by the author to his readers- By<lb/>
changing the active to passive we can duck a few<lb/>
of these- Now to take up the questions in your letter<lb/>
I really know any little of my own knowledge about<lb/>
Lazear's illness because I was absent from Marianao<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06307101"/>
2-<lb/>
Col. Havard and I had arranged for a tour of inspect-<lb/>
ions and to escape the hot &amp; dusty R. R. trip to Cienfuegos<lb/>
we arranged to go there by sea on the transport Sedgwick<lb/>
We accordingly went on her early in the morning of <del>the</del><lb/>
Sept. 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I do not think that I knew <add>there</add> of Lazear's illness,<lb/>
certainly not of the diagnosis- We made a slow trip<lb/>
because we found an English Schooner in distress<lb/>
off Cape San Antonio and had to low her all the way<lb/>
into Cienfuegos- We returned to Havana also on the<lb/>
Sedgwick and <add>I</add> did not home until the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <add>Monday</add>- When<lb/>
I heard of Cartwrights death on the 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> <add>- Sunday</add> and of the<lb/>
grave illness of Lazear, who died the next day- Tuesday<lb/>
I think I went to see him but he was so ill that I did<lb/>
not stay- I have no record of this visit in my<lb/>
diary however- Cartwright I had found sick at the Hd-<lb/>
qrs just the Sunday before and had spent the day with him<lb/>
&amp; diagnosed his case as suspicious &amp; sent him to the Y. F.<lb/>
wards in the afternoon against his earnest protests.<lb/>
I find in my diary &ldquo;Tuesday Sept. 18. Field P. C. came in on the<lb/>
Sedgwick last night. Baker, <hi>Truby</hi> and Ladd came also&rdquo;</p>
<p>As to when Reed heard of Lazier's death I do not remem-<lb/>
ber- If he did not sail from New York until Friday 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
he doubtless heard it in Washington on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- I am quite<lb/>
confident that he knew it when we met him on the evening<lb/>
of the 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> of October but he <hi>may</hi> have heard it after he got to<lb/>
<unclear>Matansas</unclear> but before we met him- Those transports with<lb/>
good weather usually arrived in Cuba on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> day<lb/>
which would fit in with sailing on the (<hi>28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>)</p>

<item>(2) Yes that fine old gentleman Dr. L. O. Howard is still alive<lb/>
and is 87 years old so Adm. Still told us a week ago<lb/>
as the meeting of the Walter Reed Memorial Assn when we<lb/>
elected him on the Board of Managers in place of Dr Stiles-<lb/>
I think I wrote you this in my last letter- It will be<lb/>
all right for you to quote anything he ever wrote me</item>
<item>(3) Now dont you waste your time on Major General<lb/>
Walter Lawrence Reed for he is a quear dick-<lb/>
There is no good reason that I can think of- <add>for not answering your letter</add>-<lb/>
When he was made Inspector Gen. I called up<lb/>
his mother on the phone and said. I want to congratulate<lb/>
you on Lawrence's fine promotion. I will not send<lb/>
him any congratulation because he never answers my<lb/>
letters "- She said &ldquo;Oh you must not mind that, he<lb/>
never answers mine either&rdquo;-</item>
<item>(4.) I wrote you in my last of having received your<lb/>
memoir from Dr. Hench- I have not read <unclear>our</unclear> Pinto's<lb/>
remarks carefully but will do so tomorrow-<lb/>
I will pass it on to Elizabeth shortly.<lb/>
I have been much interrupted since I began<lb/>
this <unclear>by</unclear> visitors and will now stop and get a<lb/>
much needed dose of medicine for my cold-<lb/>
I'll give you one guess as to what it will be-<lb/>
I wrote you how pleased I was with Andrus's<lb/>
Tale of a Guinea Pig- Love to the dear lady</item>
