<p>Kean informs Wood that he has read Sullivan's manuscript and Wood's memorandum regarding the work of Gorgas in Cuba.

Major General Leonard Wood, U.S. Army,<lb/>
Manila, P.I.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Wood:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was much interested to receive from you several<lb/>
weeks ago a copy of Mr. Mark Sullivan's chapter on Gorgas<lb/>
with some other papers and your memorandum for Mr. Sullivan<lb/>
which I was to give to him after going over it and making<lb/>
any suggestions of corrections which seemed desirable. I<lb/>
had a talk with Mr. Sullivan over the 'phone and he said he<lb/>
would come down and see me, get the papers and talk things<lb/>
over. This was ten days ago and as he has not yet come, I<lb/>
will call him up again and if he is not able to come, I will<lb/>
mail him your memorandum together with the copy of the memo-<lb/>
randum of errors which I have attached to your copy of the<lb/>
chapter on Gorgas. <add>(He didnt come)</add></p>
<p>I was very glad to be able to read your memorandum<lb/>
to him with your estimate of Gorgas' work, with which I<lb/>
absolutely agree. I want to thank you for the kind and com-<lb/>
plimentary references to me in the paper. It <unclear><del>is</del><add>was</add> most</unclear> impor-<lb/>
tant that the fact should be brought out clearly that noth-<lb/>
ing of value could have been accomplished in Cuba without<lb/>
the sympathetic and invaluable assistance of the military<lb/>
government. I used to tell Michie that neither our dear<lb/>
Chief, General Lee, or any other of the Generals in Cuba<lb/>
would ever have authorized the experiments on human beings<lb/>
which were necessary to the demonstration of the role of<lb/>
the mosquito. I was talking with Prof. Wm. C. Welch about<lb/>
this the other day at lunch. I always had an idea that<lb/>
Gorgas was so slow in accepting the practical value of Reed's<lb/>
demonstrations that it was due to your pushing him that he<lb/>
finally began mosquito work in Havana in March, 1901. I<lb/>
do not find, however, that this has ever been stated by you<lb/>
or anyone else.<add>*</add></p>
<p><add>* Since this was written Gen. Frank R. McCoy has written<lb/>
me that it was true.</add></p>

<p>I have seen McCoy once or twice. He is now very<lb/>
busy, as you know, being a member of the Mitchell Court<lb/>
Martial which is occupying a great deal of space in the<lb/>
newspapers these days.</p>
<p>With best wishes and cordial regards to Mrs. Wood,<lb/>
I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
