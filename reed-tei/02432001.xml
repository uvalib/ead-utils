<salute>My dear Miss Fatty Oomsey:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Well, if<lb/>
you are not the sweetest Miss<lb/>
Fatty that ever lived, I don't<lb/>
know! call me &ldquo;M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smarty&rdquo;, did<lb/>
you? Well, <hi>I like that</hi>! And<lb/>
you are &ldquo;getting old&rdquo;!! Just wait<lb/>
till <hi>I get there</hi>, and <hi>I'll</hi> see if I<lb/>
can't take some of that stiffness<lb/>
and &ldquo;old age&rdquo; out of your bones!<lb/>
I'll propose to give you the<lb/>
greatest <hi>shaking up</hi> that you<lb/>
have ever had! Just put that<lb/>
in your pipe and smoke it; do<lb/>
you hear? Bless your darling<lb/>
heart, the reason I didn't<lb/>
write a postscript on the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02432002"/>
the morning on which the mail<lb/>
leaves, was because I was<lb/>
trying to get a little sleep in<lb/>
the morning! and for that, my<lb/>
precious oomsey jumps on me<lb/>
with both feet! But I know<lb/>
that you don't mean one<lb/>
word you say- When I get<lb/>
back, I know that you will<lb/>
be so glad to set eyes<lb/>
on you good-looking, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
Mantee, that you will re-<lb/>
ceive him with both arms<lb/>
open! Yes<del>s</del> you will, Miss<lb/>
Fatty! Darboy wrote me the<lb/>
other day that he had failed<lb/>
to write to you for the first<lb/>
time <del>that</del> since he had been<lb/>
in Cuba- And I straightway<lb/>
said to myself, &ldquo;Lordy! but<lb/>
won't his Mama dress that<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02432003"/>
young man down&rdquo;! He! He!!<lb/>
Well, Sweet Lady of 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> St., I<lb/>
went down, yesterday, to Havana,<lb/>
and<del>go</del> got permission to go on<lb/>
the Ward Line Steamer, Havana,<lb/>
which leaves at 1 P.M. Saturday<lb/>
Next, Feb. 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- So don't worry<lb/>
anymore, Miss Sweetness and<lb/>
Prettyness, but just think of me<lb/>
as sailing on the &ldquo;briny deep&rdquo;<lb/>
from that time till Tuesday noon,<lb/>
12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, when we should about make<lb/>
New York Harbor- By the way,<lb/>
did you know that Darboy's<lb/>
regiment has been relieved<lb/>
from duty in Cuba and ordered<lb/>
to the U.S. via New Orleans-<lb/>
Two battalions will start<lb/>
pretty soon for the Phillip-<lb/>
pines I guess- Whether his<lb/>
battallion will stay in the<lb/>
U.S. as the home battalion<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02432004"/>
I don't know, but hope so-<lb/>
I heard that he was in love<lb/>
with a red-headed Cuban girl-<lb/>
Wouldn't that be jolly? Well,<lb/>
I should say so! How would you<lb/>
like a red-headed daughter-<lb/>
in-law? This evening, I again<lb/>
went to Tea at Major Dunn's and<lb/>
had something real good to eat-<lb/>
I don't know why, but they<lb/>
seem to have taken a fancy<lb/>
to me and are awfully nice about<lb/>
having me at their house- She<lb/>
is the daughter of same Congressman<lb/>
from Pa, &amp; just as pleasant as<lb/>
she can be- Now, dearest heart,<lb/>
you must excuse this pen, for<lb/>
its the worst, I ever did try-<lb/>
Excuse this short letter, which<lb/>
<hi>I</hi> think is <hi>much</hi> better than <hi>no</hi><lb/>
letter, don't you? Be a good little<lb/>
oomsey till I get there and take<lb/>
good care of precious little lamb-<lb/>
Kiss her &amp; &ldquo;Dooggy&rdquo; for their grandpa.<lb/>
Love &amp; kisses for my sweet, sweet<lb/>
girls- Boo! Boo!</p>
