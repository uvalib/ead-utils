Senora Maria Teresa Rojas<lb/>

Paris, France<lb/>
<salute>My dear Tina:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of September 18. I have sent you two or three rather<lb/>
long communications in Havana during the last several weeks and, not<lb/>
having heard from you, assumed that you must be away, possibly in Europe.<lb/>
No, I never did get your letter from Vienna and am very sorry not to<lb/>
have it.</p>
<p>I am somewhat concerned about the present plans for the preservation of<lb/>
Camp Lazear. I am not at all sure that they are going to call it Camp<lb/>
Lazear. I still suspect they will call it Parque Finlay although Doctor<lb/>
Nogueira tells me otherwise. They had planned to dedicate it the end of<lb/>
September but now have changed the date to December 3, the date of<lb/>
Finlay's birth. Also, they are repairing the little building and I do<lb/>
hope they won't rip out so much of the original wood as to make what is<lb/>
left simply a replica. I assume that the mail that I sent to you is<lb/>
still at your home in Havana, and I shall be anxious to have your reactions<lb/>
to the detailed information I have sent to you. Just last week I heard<lb/>
from Doctor Nogueira about the December 3 date. I have sent him the names<lb/>
of certain people that should be invited but in view of the uncertainties,<lb/>
I imagine they have not invited anyone yet. I hate very much to bother<lb/>
you as when you get home you will be tired and want to rest, but if you<lb/>
could go over the material I sent fairly soon, I would be very grateful<lb/>
for your suggestions and advice.</p>
<p>No, I do not expect to be in New York the middle of November. Mrs. Hench<lb/>
and I will be in Boston on October 29 but I must come right back. She is<lb/>
fine and we have just sent the kids off to college again. Kahler is in<lb/>
his second year at Yale Medical School. Susan, having spent the summer<lb/>
in Europe, is now back at Wellesley, a sophomore. Little John keeps us<lb/>
company. I wish we could drop in and visit you for a few hours at the<lb/>
Hotel Meurice. Mary will never forget her time with you there and we also<lb/>
had the family there on our way to Stockholm. I imagine that Lydia is<lb/>
with you. We send our very best wishes to you both.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
