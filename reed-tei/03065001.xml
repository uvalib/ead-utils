<p>BOOK REVIEWS AND<lb/>
NOTICES</p>
<p>William Crawford Gorgas, His Life and Work; by Marie D.<lb/>
Gorgas and Burton J. Hendrick, Illus. Large 8 vo., 359 pg.<lb/>
Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., New York, 1924.</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>The title of this official biogra-<lb/>
phy of Gen. Gorgas as borne on<lb/>
the title-page is &ldquo;William Craw-<lb/>
ford Gorgas; His Life and Work.<lb/>
The jacket, however, carries a<lb/>
sort of sub-title, interpolated im-<lb/>
mediately after William Crawford<lb/>
Gorgas, viz. &ldquo;The Conqueror of<lb/>
Yellow Fever,&rdquo; and one feels that,<lb/>
while it was not necessary so to<lb/>
ticket Gen. Gorgas, it would have<lb/>
been fitting to make this best of<lb/>
his titles a part of the book's title.</p>
<p>And one feels this the more af-<lb/>
ter one has read the book for the<lb/>
Gorgas whose life it describes is<lb/>
pre-eminently, not to say exclu-<lb/>
sively, the Conqueror of Yellow<lb/>
Fever and the &ldquo;Work&rdquo; recounted<lb/>
is the Conquering.</p>
<p>It should not be inferred from<lb/>
this comment that the Life is<lb/>
biassed, thrown out of proportion,<lb/>
by the prominence given to yel-<lb/>
low fever and its conquest or that<lb/>
it is lacking in those personal<lb/>
touches which Mrs. Gorgas' co-<lb/>
authorship would lead one to hope<lb/>
for and without which it would<lb/>
be very unsatisfactory to any<lb/>
friend or even any mere admirer<lb/>
of Gen. Gorgas. On the contrary<lb/>
there is much that is personal,--<lb/>
intimate, and one gets a very vi-<lb/>
vid picture of an extremely human<lb/>
personality in all its relationships:<lb/>
the first chapter, for instance, en-<lb/>
titled &ldquo;Early Days of Fort Brown,&rdquo;<lb/>
tells very delightfully of how Miss<lb/>
Doughty first met Dr. Gorgas and<lb/>
how she, eventually, capitulated.<lb/>
Incidentally it shows the young<lb/>
doctor to have had much senti-<lb/>
ment, some sentimentality--he<lb/>
asked for &ldquo;a flower and a bit of<lb/>
ribbon&rdquo; very early in the siege--,<lb/>
a sense of humor as keen as his<lb/>
sense of duty and a whole lot of<lb/>
other &ldquo;simpatico&rdquo; qualities. And<lb/>
yet the first sentence in the chap-<lb/>
ter, hence the first sentence in the<lb/>
book, is:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At every stage of his career<lb/>
William Crawford Gorgas seemed<lb/>
to confront the gaunt spectre of<lb/>
yellow fever: it was an important<lb/>
influence even in the love story<lb/>
of the doctor's life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>and the last sentence of the<lb/>
chapter is, all of which, by the<lb/>
way, is told in Mrs. Gorgas' own<lb/>
words, is</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be untrue to say that<lb/>
Yellow Jack was best man at our<lb/>
wedding--but it would be perfect-<lb/>
ly true to say that in a sense he<lb/>
was an usher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the second chapter--&ldquo;An-<lb/>
cestry and Youth&rdquo;--, which is not<lb/>
quite so redolent of yellow fever,<lb/>
one gleans much significant in-<lb/>
formation: that, though the name<lb/>
Gorgas may once have been<lb/>
Spanish, the family, when it<lb/>
reached America, was thoroughly<lb/>
Dutch and Protestant; that Gen.<lb/>
Gorgas' immediate ancestors lived<lb/>
in Pennsylvania; that his father,<lb/>
Josiah Gorgas, graduated from<lb/>
West Point, spent many years in<lb/>
various southern army posts,--in<lb/>
several of which he came into<lb/>
close and horryifying contact with<lb/>
Yellow fever--, married a Miss<lb/>
Gayle of Alabama, threw in his<lb/>
lot with the Confederacy, became<lb/>
its Chief of Ordnance and one of<lb/>
its ablest generals, and fell with<lb/>
it<unclear>;</unclear> that William Crawford, the<lb/>
oldest son of Josiah, was born at<lb/>
Toulsminville, Alabama, October<lb/>
3rd., 1854<unclear>;</unclear> had a very normal<lb/>
childhood, a boyhood marked by a<lb/>
love of sports, a dislike for study,<lb/>
a keenness for combat and a de-<lb/>
termination to be a soldier which,<lb/>
in view of the surroundings in<lb/>
which he was brought up, was<lb/>
hardly to be wondered at: he<lb/>
heard the firing on Sumter, spent<lb/>
his most impressionable years in<lb/>
the belligerant atmosphere of<lb/>
Civil War Richmond and saw daily<lb/>
at close quarters Jefferson Davis,<lb/>
Albert Sidney Johnston, Lee,<lb/>
Stonewall Jackson.</p>
<p>On the fall of the Confederacy<lb/>
the Gorgas family found its way<lb/>
to Baltimore. Of his own arrival<lb/>
there Gorgas once said &ldquo;I first<lb/>
came to Baltimore a ragged, bare-<lb/>
foot little rebel, with empty<lb/>
pockets and an empty stomach.&rdquo;<lb/>
Josiah Gorgas, the father, changed<lb/>
his uniform for overalls, became<lb/>
manager of a blast furnace and<lb/>
spent four unprofitable, well-nigh<lb/>
disastrous years at it.</p>
<p>But the South was gradually<lb/>
finding educational billets for its<lb/>
distressed military leaders and<lb/>
Josiah Gorgas became President<lb/>
of Sewanee University.</p>
<p>It was there that William Craw-<lb/>
ford first exhibited any real in-<lb/>
terest in study. He had long since<lb/>
established a considerable reputa-<lb/>
tion as a college athlete--his per-<lb/>
formances, especially at base-ball,<lb/>
swimming and boxing appear to<lb/>
have been really first class--but<lb/>
his class-work left much to be<lb/>
desired. The change began with<lb/>
William's overhearing his father<lb/>
lament his disinclination to study<lb/>
and the day came--for William<lb/>
had already begun to develope a<lb/>
conscience--when the delighted<lb/>
father could record in his diary<lb/>
that &ldquo;Willie has turned scholar<lb/>
since nearly a year ago and is<lb/>
perhaps the first scholar here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at Sewanee, too, that<lb/>
he definitely decided to study me-<lb/>
dicine<unclear>;</unclear> all his family's efforts to<lb/>
get him an appointment to West<lb/>
Point had failed and he would be-<lb/>
come a soldier; the only road was<lb/>
the medical profession.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to follow the<lb/>
book through his life as a medical<lb/>
student. He got his degree from<lb/>
Bellevue in 1879 and, after a brief<lb/>
stay there as an interne, entered<lb/>
the Medical Department of the U.<lb/>
S. Army in June of 1880.</p>
<p>A story having reference to this<lb/>
incident and very characteristic<lb/>
of Gorgas brings the chapter on<lb/>
&ldquo;Ancestry and Youth&rdquo; to a close:<lb/>
Gorgas and Vaughn were again in<lb/>
consultation and had already<lb/>
reached one decision when Gorgas<lb/>
turned to his associate and re-<lb/>
marked, with a twinkle in his eye:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your judgment and it<lb/>
is mine, Vaughn. But remember<lb/>
that your judgment and mine have<lb/>
at times been at fault. Do you<lb/>
recollect that I recommended the<lb/>
burning of the village at Siboney<lb/>
in 1898, in order to stamp out yel-<lb/>
low fever? I have often wondered<lb/>
how many infected mosquitoes<lb/>
were destroyed in that conflagra-<lb/>
tion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chapter &ldquo;Yellow Fever<lb/>
Meets Its Master&rdquo; begins with<lb/>
the significant statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1898 Gorgas returned to<lb/>
Havana and, after a few months,<lb/>
became chief sanitary officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There follows a very interesting<lb/>
account of various yellow fever<lb/>
epidemics illustrative of the fact<lb/>
that, because of their psychologi-<lb/>
cal as well as their physical ef-<lb/>
fects, conquest of the Tropics<lb/>
would have been impossible so<lb/>
long as yellow fever remained un-<lb/>
conquered. Extracts from the ac-<lb/>
count of the Philadelphia epidemic<lb/>
of 1793 follow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As phases of business and com-<lb/>
munity life came suddenly to an<lb/>
end; banks closed, factories shut<lb/>
their doors, leaving thousands<lb/>
without employment, newspapers<lb/>
stopped publication, and churches<lb/>
ceased their functions for want<lb/>
of congregations. Sick persons<lb/>
sometimes fell dead in the streets,<lb/>
their corpses lying for weeks with-<lb/>
out burial. Almost the only occu-<lb/>
pations were the absurd attemps<lb/>
to check the disease. There was<lb/>
an idea that the &ldquo;purification&rdquo; of<lb/>
the atmosphere would bring relief:<lb/>
to accomplish this bonfires were<lb/>
lighted at every street corner and<lb/>
cannon were constantly booming.<lb/>
All those who ventured out car-<lb/>
ried sponges at their mouths or<lb/>
smelling bottles of vinegar and<lb/>
camphor; not only men, but wo-<lb/>
men, were constantly smoking ci-<lb/>
gars, for tobacco was regarded as<lb/>
a preventive<unclear>;</unclear> while others spent<lb/>
most of their time chewing garlic.<lb/>
A tarred rope was also believed<lb/>
to have protective virtues, and<lb/>
nearly everybody who stepped out-<lb/>
doors carried such a talisman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, as illustrative of the<lb/>
universal ignorance concerning the<lb/>
cause of yellow fever:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the public terror in-<lb/>
spired by yellow fever was caused<lb/>
chiefly by the fact that it behaved<lb/>
so mysteriously. It was unlike any<lb/>
other known disease and the most<lb/>
grotesque explanations were given<lb/>
of its cause. It was disseminated<lb/>
by &ldquo;noxious gases,&rdquo; by &ldquo;swamp<lb/>
miasma,&rdquo; by fermentation, by dry<lb/>
particles of dust, by the explosion<lb/>
of subtle poisons in the air, by<lb/>
putrefying vegetable matter. Cer-<lb/>
tain learned gentlemen maintain-<lb/>
ed that it was caused by the Gulf<lb/>
Stream, while others insisted that<lb/>
eating apples conveyed the infec-<lb/>
tion. The medical faculty almost<lb/>
came to blows over the question<lb/>
of contagion. So great a man as<lb/>
Dr. Benjamin Rush declared that<lb/>
yellow fever was not contagious<lb/>
--&ldquo;and he found the explanation<lb/>
of the Philadelphia epidemic in<lb/>
decaying coffee on the docks.&rdquo;<lb/>
And yet &ldquo;Dr. Rush notes that the<lb/>
'moschetoes were very plentiful<lb/>
about Philadelphia in <unclear>1793</unclear> and<lb/>
Noah Webster, describing the New<lb/>
York visitation of 1795, says that<lb/>
&lsquo;musquetoes were never before<lb/>
known by the oldest inhabitants<lb/>
to have been so numerous.&rsquo; The<lb/>
accounts of practically all epide-<lb/>
mics since have contained the<lb/>
same comment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This picture of the &ldquo;monster<lb/>
whose destruction now became the<lb/>
chief duty of Gorgas&rdquo; is followed<lb/>
a picturesque description of san-<lb/>
itary--unsanitary, mejor dicho--<lb/>
conditions in Havana<unclear>;</unclear> a considera-<lb/>
tion of Gorgas' belief, based on<lb/>
the fomites theory, that he could<lb/>
rid the city of yellow <unclear>faver</unclear> by<lb/>
cleaning it up<unclear>;</unclear> an account of his<lb/>
Herculean efforts in that direc-<lb/>
tion and of their excellent effect<lb/>
on general health conditions, but<lb/>
their complete failure to eradicate<lb/>
or even arrest yellow fever<unclear>;</unclear> an<lb/>
acknowledgement of Finlay's dis-<lb/>
covery of the true--the Ste-<lb/>
gomyia--theory and a careful ana-<lb/>
lysis of his absolute failure to<lb/>
prove it--to produce &ldquo;a single<lb/>
case of yellow fever by the bite<lb/>
of a mosquito;&rdquo; a tribute to the<lb/>
work of Carter, Reed, Carroll,<lb/>
Lazear, Agramonte, in proving the<lb/>
Stegomyia theory and giving it a<lb/>
practical application.</p>
