<p>Valuable Discoveries in Havana.</p>
<p>We hail with enthusiasm the latest dis-<lb/>
coveries announced by the &ldquo;American<lb/>
commission&rdquo; in Havana. The estimable<lb/>
gentlemen who constitute this august body<lb/>
and who, according to all accounts, have<lb/>
devoted their energies and brains to the<lb/>
investigation during the past few months<lb/>
have now reached a definite conclusion,<lb/>
which, we are sure, will be received with<lb/>
real emotion by every yellow fever expert<lb/>
in the land. A press dispatch, dated Ha-<lb/>
vana, 9th instant, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The American commission, under the superin-<lb/>
tendence of Dr. Reed, which has been making ex-<lb/>
periments at Quemados as to the propagation of the<lb/>
yellow fever germs by the mosquito, has obtained<lb/>
extremely satisfactory results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Reed says the experiments show, beyond a<lb/>
doubt, that there is no contagion from an infected<lb/>
person or from infected clothing, but that the mos-<lb/>
quitoes alone are responsible for the spread of the<lb/>
diesase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Reed and his coadjutors are to be<lb/>
congratulated upon at least one of their<lb/>
conclusions, viz., that yellow fever is not<lb/>
contagious--that is to say, not communi-<lb/>
cable by one person to another. Although<lb/>
this has been known to yellow fever spe-<lb/>
cialists for more than half a century, and<lb/>
is abundantly proved by the records of the<lb/>
Charity Hospital, the Parish Prison, and<lb/>
the Hotel Dieu in New Orleans, it is evi-<lb/>
dently a brand-new proposition to Dr.<lb/>
Reed, and he is fully entitled to a patent<lb/>
on it. No physician has ever filed a ca-<lb/>
veat in the premises. Dr. Reed bestrides<lb/>
the field. We know he is right, because<lb/>
all the great Southern experts--Bruns,<lb/>
Brickell, Holcombe, Holt, Choppin, and a<lb/>
hundred others we could name, to say<lb/>
nothing of the greatest of them all, Dr.<lb/>
Warren Stone, who went from Connecti-<lb/>
cut to New Orleans in the forties and soon<lb/>
revolutionized the treatment of the disease<lb/>
with magnificent results--we know he is<lb/>
right because all well-informed people<lb/>
have certified to it for two generations<lb/>
past. As far back as 1854 Dr. W. J. Truck,<lb/>
of Memphis, Tenn., contributed to the<lb/>
New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal<lb/>
an article on yellow fever, in the course<lb/>
of which he said: &ldquo;Bearing, then, in mind<lb/>
the above definition of the term contagion,<lb/>
as defined by the best authorities and com-<lb/>
mon usage, we believe the position may be<lb/>
clearly and fully maintained that yellow<lb/>
fever is not a contagious disease.&rdquo; Of<lb/>
course not. Hundreds of New Orleans<lb/>
men still living are ready to certify to the<lb/>
truth of Dr. Reed's pronunciamento. Un-<lb/>
questionably, he is warranted to this ex-<lb/>
tent.</p>
<p>As to the mosquitoes--those much-abused<lb/>
but cheerful and industrious insects--we<lb/>
are not so sure. The theory offers an easy<lb/>
escape from a difficulty which has baffled<lb/>
the profession for many years past. San-<lb/>
arelli's germs have been exploded. Dr.<lb/>
Doty, of New York, stands an unveiled<lb/>
humbug. Every boasted &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; of<lb/>
the yellow fever germ has been repudiated<lb/>
after scientific and dispassionate investi-<lb/>
gation. Really, it seems to us that we<lb/>
might as well put it on the mosquitoes.<lb/>
They are pests by universal consent, and<lb/>
they have no friends worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Put it on the mosquitoes and let it go at<lb/>
that!</p>
