Mr. Adamson,<lb/>
House of Representatives,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Mr. Adamson:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am in receipt of a letter enclosing Report No. 515,<lb/>
House of Representatives, Without discussing this Report--<lb/>
which to me seems better than the Bill it amends--let me, if I<lb/>
may do so without offense, say one thing. I have talked with<lb/>
many old Isthmenos, mainly civilians, since the passage of the<lb/>
Bill of last spring, and can say that a bill giving the &ldquo;Thanks<lb/>
of Congress&rdquo; to Colonel Gorgas: John F. Stevens and Colonel<lb/>
Goethals, and nothing else, would have been considered by most<lb/>
of them, as sufficient recognition of us, who had worked with<lb/>
them. I, at least, who was promoted under the last Bill, would<lb/>
have been better satisfied if the three chief men named above--<lb/>
The two Chief Engineers and the Chief of the Sanitary Department--<lb/>
had received the thanks of Congress and all the rest of the Bill<lb/>
left out. The thanks of Congress should be sufficient acknowledge-<lb/>
ment for any man without the addition of pecuniary or rank-increas-<lb/>
ing rewards. It has rarely been given indiscriminately. There<lb/>
seems every reason why Mr. Stevens--a civilian--should have re-<lb/>
ceived recognition as well as we who are in the regular Services.<lb/>
He was second to no one in the construction of the Canal.</p>

<p>-2-</p>
<p>I don't think this is an attempt to influence Congres-<lb/>
sional action. I do not mean it as such. It is simply to let<lb/>
you know how a number of the old Canal men feel on this subject.<lb/>
I think I can speak for many of those who went down in the begin-<lb/>
ning. I began work in May /04 and bore the heat and burden of<lb/>
the work. There was really no risk to health and no hardship<lb/>
to Americans after June 1906. In 1904 and 1915 there was both.</p>
