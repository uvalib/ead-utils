<salute>My esteemed Doctor:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your kind letter of June 24 and I ask your<lb/>
foregiveness because of the delay in answering it. This has been<lb/>
due to the fact that I have been ill.</p>
<p>In regard to the business that you refer to in your letter,<lb/>
I inform you that I was interning in the Military Hospital in the<lb/>
years 1923 to 1926, and in this last year, I took the photograph<lb/>
of which you know. That location was pointed at by the people as<lb/>
the place where the Camp Lazear was built, and the little house was<lb/>
supposed to be the remains of it; this was vox populi, without my<lb/>
having any personal proof of it. As historical data it occurred<lb/>
to me to take the photograph and present a copy of it to Dr. Recio,<lb/>
who was one of my favorite teachers.</p>
<p>The looks of the little house was rather shabby, but it<lb/>
must be realized that much time had gone by between its construction<lb/>
and 1926, and also that people from the lower classes had been using<lb/>
it and had failed to make the necessary repairs. In regard to the<lb/>
tree, I don't know whether it is still in evidence, but I must point<lb/>
out the fact that I took that photograph in May, 1926, and in October<lb/>
of the same year, a cyclone went through that region and the house<lb/>
and the tree <add>may have</add> disappeared.</p>
<p>This is all I have to inform you, and it is a pleasure to<lb/>
have answered your letter.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours truly,</salute>
