<salute>My dear Miss Lyons:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of February 5 asking for my help in the develop-<lb/>
ment of a program to be used on the occasion of the unveiling of the bust and<lb/>
tablet of Walter Reed in the Hall of Fame, May 20. I am so delighted that the<lb/>
ceremoney has been arranged and I shall be glad to help in every way possible.</p>
<p>I have been made the custodian of an enormous amount of material per-<lb/>
taining to Walter Reed and his colleagues. This material has been placed in<lb/>
my possession by the widow and daughter of Walter Reed and by the close rela-<lb/>
tives and friends of many of his associates, such as the Lazear family, the<lb/>
family of Agramonte, General Jefferson R. Kean of Washington, D. C., General<lb/>
Albert Truby of San Francisco, and others. As custodian of this material, it<lb/>
is my desire to use it properly and in a dignified manner to honor the memory<lb/>
of these distinguished scientists. Therefore, I am glad to make some sugges-<lb/>
tions as to what photographs might go in your program for the Walter Reed<lb/>
Celebration.</p>
<p>May I suggest some of the following: (1) The classical photograph of<lb/>
Walter Reed. (2) An unpublished photograph of Reed on the way to Cuba to do<lb/>
his yellow fever work. (3) Photograph of his birth-place. (4) Photograph<lb/>
of the special Congressional medal given to him and to his colleagues. (5)<lb/>
Reproduction of the famous New Years Eve letter which Reed wrote at midnight,<lb/>
December 21, 1900 and January 1, 1901. This letter was written to his wife<lb/>
in a spirit of humbleness and exaltation. It has been widely quoted in part.<lb/>
(Certain personal parts of the letter could well be omitted but I believe we<lb/>
could photograph the letter appropriately for the purposes of your program.)<lb/>
(6) A photograph of the Schuler bust. (7) A reproduction of the Walter Reed<lb/>
memorial stamp (with permission of the Postal Department). (8) A photograph<lb/>
of Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D. C., the greatest monument to Reed.<lb/>
(9) A photograph of Camp Lazear in Cuba where Reed and his associates con-<lb/>
cluded their epoch-making work. (10) Possibly a photograph of Reed's grave<lb/>
in Arlington National Cemetry. (11) A boyhood photograph. (12) A repro-<lb/>
duction of one of Reed's degrees, either his original medical degree from the<lb/>
University of Virginia or his honorary degree from Harvard or Michigan. (13)<lb/>
A photograph of one or two pages of his laboratory notebook in his own hand-<lb/>
writing. (14) A reproduction of part of one of his letters to his wife written<lb/>
during the excitement of the experiments. (15) Possibly a reproduction of a<lb/>
part of one of his early letters to his finances before they were married, in<lb/>
which he expressed even then, early in life, an earnest desire to help humanity.</p>

<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>February 23, 1948</p>
<p>Before definitely allowing you to reproduce the letters, I should<lb/>
like to have the permission of his immediate family, his son General Reed and<lb/>
his daughter, Blossom Reed.</p>
<p>One additional thought occurs to me. You will remember that the<lb/>
frontice piece of General Truby's book comprises a colored reproduction of<lb/>
the well-known painting by Cornwell, &ldquo;Conquerors of Yellow Fever&rdquo;. I had<lb/>
something to do with the arrangement of this painting which was done under the<lb/>
sponsorship of Mr. John Law of the Wyeth Company. On certain special occasions<lb/>
such as for General Truby's book and for the reprint which I am sending you,<lb/>
Mr. Law has permitted reproduction of this painting and indeed has, on oc-<lb/>
casion, provided either the colored plates or the actual colored inserts at<lb/>
little cost to the reproducer. May I suggest that you write to him if you<lb/>
should wish to consider having a colored plate as part of your program. I<lb/>
think it would be a very nice thing because as I must tell you frankly, there<lb/>
are those whose loyalty is divided and who believe that Reed's colleagues who<lb/>
helped him so much (especially lazear) deserve definite honorable mention in<lb/>
any discussion of Reed's work. There may be some such in your audience and<lb/>
the inclusion of this colored plate would, I believe, give the surviving rela-<lb/>
tives of Reed's colleagues considerable satisfaction. I believe you would want<lb/>
to reproduce somewhere in the program the citation honoring Reed made by Presi-<lb/>
dent Elliott of Harvard.</p>
<p>Practically all of the items mentioned above I have in my possession.<lb/>
Given a little more time, I could make other suggestions. It happens that<lb/>
your letter caught me at a disadvantage, as I am leaving tomorrow for my first<lb/>
post-war vacation. Mrs. Hench and I are going to the Villa Atlantique, Palm<lb/>
Beach, Florida until March 1 and then we go to the Hotel Nacional, Cuba, should<lb/>
you want to reach me.</p>
<p>I enclose an additional list of items. I would appreciate it greatly<lb/>
if you would return this to me as it is the only copy I have left.</p>
<p>The man, above all, who was so close to Reed and knows so much about<lb/>
him, is General Jefferson R. Kean, 2804 N Street, N. W., Georgetown, Washing-<lb/>
ton, D. C. He undoubtedly will have some excellent suggestions.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>

P. S.: I enclose a photograph of part of the New Year's Eve Letter and of some<lb/>
stamps honoring the yellow fever personalities.<lb/>
