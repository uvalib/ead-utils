<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In regard to the Mile Post, to which you<lb/>
refer in your letter, I myself did not know what they<lb/>
were putting into it. Mr. McClain got authority to<lb/>
print it and I never thought about it again. It turns<lb/>
out that he included your speech, (which I would<del>n't</del><lb/>
seriously have protested had I known it was to go in)<lb/>
and a great deal of other material, including your<lb/>
name! It was very dumb of us not to think of having<lb/>
reprints made of your speech and article in order that<lb/>
you might send them out, but we didn't think about it<lb/>
and it's too late now. Furthermore, we do not have more<lb/>
than a few copies of this or of the Alumni Bulletin,<lb/>
and I am terribly sorry about it. It is just too late<lb/>
to do anything. As soon as I got your letter we<lb/>
telephoned down to the printers to see whether by chance<lb/>
they had left that print set up but it had all been torn<lb/>
down. If you feel that it is important enough for these<lb/>
seventy or eighty people who have assisted you, I think<lb/>
that we might make a special printing of it. I could<lb/>
at least look into the expense of such a printing and<lb/>
I will do that.</p>
<p>I think you should tackle Mr. Pew for money<lb/>
toward that memorial and I see no reason for you to<lb/>
hesitate. The address is Mr. J. Howard Pew, Sun Oil<lb/>
Building 1608 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<lb/>
I hope that you may get the whole amount needed from<lb/>
Mr. Pew as I suspect that he is able to give it.</p>
<p>We did not send the brochure to Mrs. Lazear<lb/>
so far as I know, but I am sending a memo and asking<lb/>
them to do so. We failed to send a plate and therefore<lb/>
since it has gone this long and you are getting in touch<lb/>
with her, we are sending a plate and you can write to her<lb/>
and tell her that you are sending it.</p>
<p>I understand that Buddy is going to spend a day<lb/>
there after he visits out at Huron, South Dakota. I wish<lb/>
I could be there the same day but there doesn't appear to<lb/>
be much chance. Some day I'll just pass out for lack of a<lb/>
doctor!</p>

<p>Give my regards to Buddy when he comes and<lb/>
I will be trying to get out there some time. Our love<lb/>
to the family.</p>
