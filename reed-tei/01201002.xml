<salute>Dear Doctor Deeks:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Father and I would have written sooner to acknowledge and<lb/>
thank you for your much appreciated invitation to the International<lb/>
Conference at Kingston and the complimentary passes therefor, but<lb/>
have been waiting for Drs. Thayer and Parker to go over Father so<lb/>
as to be able to advise you more definitely as to the probability<lb/>
of his being able to go. Dr. Thayer has had to postpone his com-<lb/>
ing over, but Dr. Parker was here yesterday and, after going over<lb/>
Father very carefully, said that he thought it would be all right<lb/>
for him to take the trip, since I told him that you said it would<lb/>
involve very little physical exertion and <hi>no going up stairs</hi>--the<lb/>
one thing positively forbidden. I can't tell you how glad we both<lb/>
are at the prospect of going! The fact of you and Dr. Thayer be-<lb/>
ing along makes me feel so safe about Father, besides being an<lb/>
assurance of delightful companionship.</p>
<p>As to our itinerary: I understood from you when you were<lb/>
here the other day that you had already reserved passage for us<lb/>
on the boat on which you, and most of your guests, were sailing on<lb/>
July 12th. (The &ldquo;Calamares&rdquo; (?)) for Havana and thence to Kingston.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01201003"/>
<p>Kingston.</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>After the Conference we'd like to make whatever part of the visit<lb/>
to the Divisions of the United Fruit Company you or Thayer make and<lb/>
come back via Panama and New York, the time for leaving Panama being,<lb/>
if possible, the same as your own. That's &ldquo;playing safe&rdquo; all the<lb/>
way through, both for Dad's health, my peace of mind and our mutual<lb/>
enjoyment.</p>
<p>The book goes on apace, but I've ceased to prophesy as to just<lb/>
when we will complete these finishing touches to Section 111. We<lb/>
are looking forward to your comment and criticism. I know you will<lb/>
enjoy it, for you can appreciate it from so many angles: epidemio-<lb/>
logical, archaelogical, clinical and literary. It really is a won-<lb/>
derful piece of work, if &ldquo;I do say it as hadn't oughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more with warmest thanks and remembrances from us both<lb/>
and with love to Mrs. Deeks and the nina.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly your friend,</salute>
<seg>
P. S. By the way, when you were at McGill, didn't you have<lb/>
some classes under a Dr. Penhallow? He had the chair of Botony.<lb/>
His son, who was in charge of a British military hospital from<lb/>
1915 on, is the Medical Officer in Command at Mt. Alto here and<lb/>
his widowed mother, who lives with him, says she is sure that she<lb/>
remembers you, both from having met you as a student and as one of<lb/>
whom her husband spoke very highly. She was very sorry to hear<lb/>
that you had been in Washington and she had not known of it.<lb/>
