Brigadier General William Ludlow, U. S. Army.<lb/>
War College Board.<lb/>
1744 G Street. Washington. D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of October 27th. was delivered to me en route<lb/>
to St. Augustin together with other mail which arrived just prior to<lb/>
my departure.</p>
<p>It was my intention to make my letter of October 25th. explicit,<lb/>
both in justice to you and to myself.</p>
<p>I stated to a number of newspaper correspondents, who called<lb/>
upon me while I was at the War Department, that I had said nothing<lb/>
which warranted the inference that yellow fever had been concealed<lb/>
in Havana, but I told them that formerly it had not been published<lb/>
in full day by day as at present. Col. Black was present at this in-<lb/>
terview. The correctness of this statement was confirmed by you in<lb/>
our interview at the Metropolitan Club, when you informed me that you<lb/>
had published a statement monthly. This whole matter seems to have<lb/>
grown out of the deductions and inferences made by a newspaper re-<lb/>
presentative. There is no statement of the kind attributed to me, but<lb/>
the newspaper correspondent infers that ........&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>I am sure that your own experience with newspapers has been<lb/>
such that you appreciate fully the impossibility of guarding against<lb/>
deductions and conclusions being made which are entirely contrary to<lb/>
the spirit and intention of the interview.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f02169002"/>
<p>Gen. Wm. Ludlow No.<lb/>
2 November 3, 1900</p>
<p>In conclusion: I have made no statement which warranted anyone<lb/>
saying that you, <add><unclear>or Genl</unclear> Brooke</add> or anyone connected with you, concealed the presence<lb/>
of yellow fever in Havana. Such an inference is absolutely unwarran-<lb/>
ted. This was stated to the representatives of the press at the in-<lb/>
terview above referred to.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
