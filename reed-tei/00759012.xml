<salute>Dear Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Today I should hear from you again- The<lb/>
boat is due Tuesday &amp; we, except once, get the mail<lb/>
Tuesday night or late afternoon. The next boat the &ldquo;Ad-<lb/>
vance&rdquo; is a slow boat &amp; is usually 12 hours late.</p>
<p>Tell Laura that the man Miss <unclear>Lemman</unclear> spoke of is<lb/>
Dr. Nolan of Fauquier a very decent fellow &amp; who may<lb/>
make something of himself- He gets $1500, per annum<lb/>
&amp; &ldquo;finds himself&rdquo; so he is not over paid;</p>
<p>Someone wrote that Gorgas needed 300 physicians &amp; I think he<lb/>
has had 3000 applications- In point of fact except, the<lb/>
service Men - (A. N. &amp; M. H. S). There are 7 physicians on<lb/>
the Isthmus one of whom was heired from the<lb/>
French Canal Company, There will probably as many<lb/>
more be needed by Xmas maybe 10 more, or even<lb/>
15; many <unclear>men</unclear> would be in one another's way.<lb/>
There are <del>or will be shortly</del> 3 from the army &amp; 1 coming: 2<lb/>
from Navy. 3 from M. H. S. &amp; 2 coming. So we will hold<lb/>
up our end of the work.</p>
<p>I have been engaged on a long report to the Commission<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00759013"/>
C1<lb/>
B23<lb/>
which I will finish tomorrow next day at any<lb/>
rate before they get here Aug 2 or 3 - setting forth<lb/>
what I need &amp; why I need it.</p>
<p>It is after coffee &amp; I am at the office now 7.<hi rend="superscript">15</hi> A. M.<lb/>
I enclose you a little piece of the sensitive plant-<lb/>
Mimosa- I waded through a mass of it Sunday<lb/>
about 4 1/2 feet high- it is almost a vine - &amp; it<lb/>
was astonishing to see the way it got out of<lb/>
ones way- not only the leaves collapsed but the<lb/>
vines twisted away from the touch. It left<lb/>
<hi>a plain path</hi> almost as if <hi>cut</hi></p>
<p>I enclose a letter to the Medical News, which<lb/>
I want sent <hi>if the reprints have not appeared</hi>.<lb/>
Tell Laura I rec'd, from Ned doubtless, Rizal's<lb/>
Noli-Me-Tangere, but that I have not looked<lb/>
in it, nor written to Ned, nor indeed which is<lb/>
worse to Mother. I have had no time which<lb/>
I felt, that I had a right to use. I am trying<lb/>
to do my work &amp; <hi>to share myself</hi>. &amp; the two<lb/>
things can both be done only by avoiding<lb/>
everything I can avoid. I will, I think, have<lb/>
time after the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of August, I <hi>have</hi> been<lb/>
working too closely, but <hi>only once</hi> at night.<lb/>
The view of the green wall of Ancon is still a perpetual delight to me</p>

ISTHMIAN CANAL COMMISSION</p>
<p>Rear Admiral JOHN G. WALKER,<lb/>
United States Navy, CHAIRMAN.<lb/>

MR. FRANK J. HECKER.</p>
<p>It is possible, but a possibility which I<lb/>
am loath to contemplate, that my last<lb/>
letter to your mother. Laura &amp; Ned, did not<lb/>
reach them, because I put <hi>Canal Zone</hi> stamps<lb/>
on them &amp; mailed them on the steamer at Colon.<lb/>
Now C. Z. stamps are no good except as letters mail-<lb/>
ed in the zone; but the P. O. people tell me that it will<lb/>
pretty certainly be delivered <del>but</del><add>&amp;</add> that extra postage<lb/>
will be charged- Will I judge you will not grudge<lb/>
2 cents for the letter. By the way the Panaman<lb/>
stamps &ldquo;surcharged Canal Zone&rdquo; <hi>&amp; Cancelled</hi>, may<lb/>
he worth something- Perry has invested <hi>about</hi><lb/>
$60 00/100 in them, keep them. If worth 25 cents apiece<lb/>
as he thinks, they are worth perserving</p>
<p>Gorgas &amp; I. (after a coffee)- started out to climb-<lb/>
Ancon - this morning - just at sunrize - we<lb/>
tried 3 blind trails - evidently made by an-<lb/>
imals which led no where in particular &amp; it is<lb/>
considered impossible (&amp; <hi>is</hi> difficult) to go up<lb/>
through the bush without a Machete. The best<lb/>
trail, which we followed same ways, was an<lb/>
<hi>ant</hi> trail! We finally walked around the<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00759015"/>


C1<lb/>
B23<lb/>
3<lb/>
hill - about 3 miles &amp; struck a trail by which<lb/>
we reached the top. It was not so high by a<lb/>
good deal as some of the Fanquier hills we<lb/>
climbed together &amp; not a rough as the first<lb/>
one we went up through the woods, but it <hi>was</hi><lb/>
steep. There were places where standing straight<lb/>
I could hold <del>out</del> my hand out horizontally &amp; touch<lb/>
the ground, the slope being about 60&deg;. I can climb<lb/>
many times better than Gorgas &amp; reached<lb/>
home perfectly fresh but decidedly <hi>wet</hi><lb/>
about <add>8.10 A M</add> <del><hi><unclear>8.10 &deg;</unclear></hi></del>, we had <del>on</del> only pajamas, trousers<lb/>
leggins shoes stockings &amp; hats. We climbed, 620'<lb/>
or rather that high above sea level - about 600'<lb/>
<unclear>think</unclear>. Last evening a deer was found dead<lb/>
near one of the wards - he had been shot <unclear>&amp; lost</unclear> &amp;<lb/>
was carried out in the bushes. &amp; certainly two<lb/>
&ldquo;tigres&rdquo; - Jaguars - came for it last night.<lb/>
It is certainly <del>stones</del> strange to think of such &ldquo;var-<lb/>
ment&rdquo; close to civilization. No one saw the<lb/>
things but their cry was mistaken for the<lb/>
scream of a patient &amp; we all ran out to<lb/>
see what was the matter. There were certain-<lb/>
ly two. How big <del>they we</del> <hi>there</hi> were, of course<lb/>
The nights are still cool &amp; it is fairly dry &amp; dusty -<lb/>
Running about 90&deg; during the day. &amp; cover comfort<lb/>
able at night-<lb/>
sun is unbearable<lb/>
&amp; I avoid it, exertion except a mile walk<lb/>
twice a day - early &amp; late I do not take.</p>
