Rochester, Minnesota<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of February 20 has had to be side-tracked because<lb/>
of an acute attack of lumbago which has crippled me up so that<lb/>
I have hardly been able to navigate. It is much better and I<lb/>
think I have it licked.</p>
<p>I will be very much interested to work on an estimate of the<lb/>
cost of Reed's Yellow Fever Board expenses, i.e., the cost of<lb/>
his experiments. However, you must not expect me to work fast<lb/>
because I just can't hurry but I'll tackle it by getting together<lb/>
some estimates of the number of men he had, whether they worked<lb/>
there full time or part time, and also get a line on the equip-<lb/>
ment they borrowed from us and which came from Havana. The cost<lb/>
of the rental of the land, I think you have the figures on that<lb/>
and the money paid to the men for volunteering. The two wooden<lb/>
buildings, tent floors, etc. were, I think, all left there.<lb/>
I'll get together some figures on various things of that kind and<lb/>
then make my tentative estimate to discuss with you. It will be<lb/>
quite interesting I am sure. I am sure there should be something<lb/>
about it in General Wood's annual reports for the years 1900 and<lb/>
1901. I have the 1901 report and I will go through it carefully<lb/>
at once. It should be there.</p>
<p>Have you any idea when you would want this finished? When you<lb/>
have some leisure time think it over and let me know.</p>
<p>In your letter of February 18, you mentioned that Dr. Nogueira<lb/>
is himself writing a book, so I have no desire to bother him about<lb/>
my book and will tell him to forget it. I have not heard from him<lb/>
since I wrote to him about this and I do not know whether he has<lb/>
received the photographs I sent him or not. The photographs were<lb/>
sent airmail and registered but I think it went marked second class<lb/>
mail. The chances are it did not go airmail. Anyway, they should<lb/>
be there by this time. No doubt, I will hear from Pedro very soon.<lb/>
No word has been received as to when the medals will be delivered.</p>
<p>I have already found in General Wood's report that the yellow<lb/>
fever camp had a telephone.</p>
<p>I hope that my plans will meet your approval. With best regards,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>

P. S. In my scrapbook which is nicely bound in red. I have<lb/>
collected important letters and papers connected with my story.<lb/>
You saw this book and were interested in Dr Ravenel's<lb/>
letters etc. Before you publish your book you should go through<lb/>
(over)<lb/>

it again. Shall I send it now and you can keep it with<lb/>
your other files of info <unclear>re</unclear> Reed's work?<lb/>
