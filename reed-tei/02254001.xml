<salute>My precious wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>This is<lb/>
Sunday evening, just after<lb/>
dinner, and I really ate so<lb/>
heartily that I feel rather<lb/>
&ldquo;logy&rdquo; for letter writing-<lb/>
Not that we had an extra<lb/>
good dinner, for aside<lb/>
from a passable soup<lb/>
and a chicken pot-pie,<lb/>
there was nothing else<lb/>
to tempt one- How I<lb/>
long once more for a<lb/>
taste of good beef-steak<lb/>
and for a hot roll! as<lb/>
for a few <hi>oysters</hi>, I would<lb/>
give half of my salary!<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02254002"/>
Yesterday I received your<lb/>
darling abbreviated letter<lb/>
of Tuesday last -- and was<lb/>
so delighted to hear that<lb/>
you are &ldquo;feeling very well&rdquo;<lb/>
once more and able to<lb/>
get about- What a seige<lb/>
my sweet wifie has had!<lb/>
The calendar came, too,<lb/>
yesterday- It made me<lb/>
laugh &amp; has afforded<lb/>
much amusement to all<lb/>
of us -- who wrote the<lb/>
verse that adorns it?<lb/>
Did you concoct that?<lb/>
or was it Dr Nash?<lb/>
By the way, last evening,<lb/>
I attended quite a swell<lb/>
banquet in Havana, given<lb/>
to Dr Finlay by some<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02254003"/>
seventy or eighty physicians<lb/>
of Havana- It was a very<lb/>
recherche' affair and extreme-<lb/>
ly enjoyable- Everything was<lb/>
in Spanish- The Governor<lb/>
General was there- The toasts<lb/>
were all in Spanish and<lb/>
the speeches, while flattering<lb/>
to Dr Finlay, for his concep-<lb/>
tion of the theory, gave us<lb/>
full credit for the discov-<lb/>
ery- It is to me surprising<lb/>
and extremely satisfactory<lb/>
to see how very quickly<lb/>
the profession of Havana<lb/>
have <hi>accepted our re-<lb/>
sults</hi>- I have seen in<lb/>
the Washington Post, Gen.<lb/>
Sternberg's statement about<lb/>
the cablegram from me-<lb/>
I suppose that the Post<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02254004"/>
will now have another<lb/>
silly editorial on the subject.<lb/>
I have allowed the men<lb/>
who have spent 20 nights<lb/>
in our infected clothing <add>house</add><lb/>
to come out, and they are now<lb/>
in quarantine- Two other<lb/>
soldiers are now occupy-<lb/>
ing the house &amp; sleeping<lb/>
not only in the <del>very</del> <add>same</add> beds<lb/>
&amp; between the <del>very</del> <add>same</add> sheets<lb/>
on which our yellow fever<lb/>
patients have <del>slep</del> rested<lb/>
during their attacks, but<lb/>
they sleep in the <hi>very shirts</hi><lb/>
that our patients wore<lb/>
<del>during</del> <add>throughout</add> their entire sickness!<lb/>
If anything should give them<lb/>
the disease, this should suc-<lb/>
ceed! Don't you think so?<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02254005"/>
Infected clothing and bedding<lb/>
has been a horrible night-<lb/>
mare during these past<lb/>
300 years, but me thinks<lb/>
it will die out <hi>very early</hi><lb/>
in the <hi>next century</hi>! yellow<lb/>
fever can no more be<lb/>
transmitted in that way<lb/>
than can Intermittent Fever!<lb/>
How Gen. Sternberg &amp; hosts<lb/>
of others could have be-<lb/>
lieved in the contagious-<lb/>
ness of clothing and of the<lb/>
stools of yellow fever pa-<lb/>
tients I cannot possibly<lb/>
see- They were simply ac-<lb/>
cepting the statements of<lb/>
others who had nothing<lb/>
on which to base such<lb/>
statements. A little careful<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02254006"/>
testing of this theory has<lb/>
served to knock it com-<lb/>
pletely into smithereens!<lb/>
I thank God that I did<lb/>
not accept anybody's opin-<lb/>
ion on this subject, but<lb/>
determined to put it to<lb/>
a thorough test with hu-<lb/>
man beings in order <hi>to<lb/>
see what</hi> would happen.<lb/>
my own observations at<lb/>
Pinar del Rio convinced<lb/>
me that infected bedding<lb/>
was indeed a <hi>myth</hi>-<lb/>
Actual trial has proven<lb/>
that I was right -- and that<lb/>
what the medical profession<lb/>
believed was <hi>wrong</hi>!<lb/>
So you have <hi>dared</hi> send<lb/>
to your dear old Mr<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02254007"/>
Mantee one of mother Greer's<lb/>
fruit-cakes? Do you want<lb/>
me to have <hi>gout</hi>, too? Look<lb/>
here, lovie, dear, how did<lb/>
you send it? by express?<lb/>
I must send to town and<lb/>
make inquiry about it-<lb/>
How sweet in dearest<lb/>
Miss Invalid to think of<lb/>
her Mr Mosquito! When<lb/>
it arrives, I shall pro-<lb/>
ceed to put my &ldquo;probos-<lb/>
cis&rdquo; into it and sip its<lb/>
juices! I know that Dar-<lb/>
boy will thoroughly en-<lb/>
joy his cake- I got, also,<lb/>
our dear little daughter's<lb/>
picture, which papa con-<lb/>
siders to be <hi>excellent</hi>- What<lb/>
a precious love she is!<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02254008"/>
I shall be so glad when Christ-<lb/>
mas has come and gone and<lb/>
New Year has come, for then<lb/>
only a few weeks will elapse<lb/>
before I can turn my face<lb/>
homeward toward my precious<lb/>
girls, whom I want to see<lb/>
more than words can tell.<lb/>
<hi>Monday morning -- 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>, well, I suppose<lb/>
that darling little daughter goes to<lb/>
Annapolis, to-day, to spend Christmas<lb/>
week- Papa hopes that she will<lb/>
have a most delightful trip.<lb/>
She must write and tell him all<lb/>
about it- Papa hopes, too, that<lb/>
dear mother won't have an utterly<lb/>
stupid time, being left all alone-<lb/>
Don't forget to get you a pretty<lb/>
present, sweetheart- write and<lb/>
tell me about it in your<lb/>
next. Papa is so sorry that he<lb/>
has to wish his darling oomsey<lb/>
a Merry Christmas at such a long<lb/>
distance- Bless my precious girls'<lb/>
hearts- Love &amp; kisses &amp; kisses &amp; love-</p>

<salute>Devotedly,</salute>
