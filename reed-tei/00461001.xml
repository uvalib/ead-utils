Mrs. Jesse W. Lazear,<lb/>
6 Oak Vale Ave.,<lb/>
Berkeley, California.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs. Lazear:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The Surgeon General has had a request from Washington and<lb/>
Jefferson College, Penna. (through a Congressman) for a sketch of your<lb/>
distinguished husband to be used in connection with the erection of a tablet<lb/>
to him at that school where it seems he received his early academic education.<lb/>
Colonel Duncan, who happens to be on duty in the Library, has looked up<lb/>
everything connected with Dr. Lazear which is now on file in the Library,<lb/>
and finds that there is very little. No biography of him seems to have<lb/>
been written. Inclosed is an abstract of everything that we could find.<lb/>
If you have any manuscript or printed matter which could supplement this<lb/>
sketch in any way, we would be glad to have it on file for future use.<lb/>
If you wish to have the manuscript or material returned it will be done.<lb/>
If you have not anything of this sort perhaps you would write out such<lb/>
additions to the sketch as you can. We would be glad, also, to have<lb/>
something about yourself, your maiden name and former home, the names<lb/>
and ages of your children and where they now are, both for our own in-<lb/>
formation and to meet future inquiries.</p>
<p>It was a great disappointment to me, as it was to The Surgeon<lb/>
General, that in passing the recent legislation to honor and reward the<lb/>
men who volunteered to be bitten by mosquitoes and experimented on in<lb/>
other ways for the Reed Board, the Committee of Congress was not willing<lb/>
to do what the Surgeon General recommended, namely, to increase the pensions<lb/>
of the widows of the deceased members of the Board to $250.00. Apparently<lb/>
the Chairman of the Pension Committee of the House was afraid of establishing<lb/>
a troublesome precedent.</p>
<p>I hope you are getting along very well. I knew Dr. Lazear<lb/>
very well during the spring and summer of 1900 when I was living at<lb/>
Columbia Barracks.</p>
<p>With cordial regards, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours sincerely,</salute>
<signed>J. R. KEAN,<lb/>
Colonel, U.S. Army, Retd.,<lb/>
Editor</signed>.
