<dateline>
HAVANA, CUBA<lb/>
<date value="1949-02-05">February 5, 1949.</date>
</dateline>
Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
MAYO CLINIC,<lb/>
Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Since I wrote to you on October 9th and during your long<lb/>
absence in Europe I hava had time and reason to reflect on the<lb/>
wisdom of having &ldquo;MY DATE WITH WALTER REED AND YELLOW JACK&rdquo; edited<lb/>
and published, as I planned to do, <hi>following destruction of the<lb/>
manuscript I had written</hi> before my session with the Grim Reaper, in<lb/>
<hi>September, 1947</hi>, and whom I temporarily cheated.</p>
<p>Now, I have arrived at a definite decision, a decision<lb/>
which I will endeavor to justify to you, with my apologies, for the<lb/>
time and trouble I have imposed upon you in a matter which has<lb/>
involved vacillation and indecision on my part.</p>
<p>Since the one object I have had in mind has been that of<lb/>
doing justice to the memory of Reed as against the all-out claims<lb/>
of the Cubans for Finlay, I <hi>have reluctantly come to the conclusion<lb/>
that publication of my memoirs would further antagonize</hi>, rather than<lb/>
diminish, the well-known attitude of the Cubans in their unilateral<lb/>
claims for Finlay.</p>
<p>You cannot convince a people with closed minds and whose<lb/>
slogan is and has been that &ldquo;To be a good Cuban you have to be anti-<lb/>
American&rdquo;. That spirit is congenital in the present generation of<lb/>
Cubans, facts and logic playing no part in their way of thinking.<lb/>
Less than three months ago, the slogan was reiterated by our mild-<lb/>
mannered friend Dr. Emilio Roig de Leuchsenring, Historian of the<lb/>
City of Havana, at a mass meeting in Central Park honoring the<lb/>
deposed president of Venezuela, ousted by a military clique. You<lb/>
will recall that Dr. E. R. de L. gave us autographed copies of his<lb/>
&ldquo;LA HABANA - Apuntes Historicas&rdquo;. The overthrow of the Venezuelan<lb/>
president was ascribed in part to Peron and in part to our State<lb/>
Department. Yankee Imperialism is always sure to &ldquo;bring down the<lb/>
house&rdquo; in every Latin American republic.</p>
<p>Following the well-known practice of the Cubans of condemn-<lb/>
ing everything American which may run counter to their views, they<lb/>
would be sure to crucify me if my memoirs were to be published in<lb/>
the manner and language which I deem appropriate. I could not white-<lb/>
wash the Cubans in any article or book to bear my name as author. I<lb/>
would certainly call a spade a spade in dealing with the Finlay-Reed<lb/>
controversy. Therefore, while I am the stranger in their midst, I<lb/>
cannot afford to antagonize them. I am sure the State Department<lb/>
would not look upon my memoirs as a service to my adopted country,<lb/>
anxious as they are in Washington to play up the Good Neighbor policy.</p>
<p>I thought I knew the Cubans when I took up permanent residence<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04302002"/>
<hi>Dr. Philip S. Hench.</hi><lb/>
-- 2 --<lb/>
<hi>Feb. 5, 1949.</hi><lb/>
here in 1928, but I have learned better during those 20 years. They<lb/>
are long on promises and short on performance, with a chip on their<lb/>
shoulders which may be displaced temporarily, only to be replaced by<lb/>
another without loss of time. Sure, like all Latin-Americans, they<lb/>
are 100% for our Good Neighbor Policy and to which they contribute not-<lb/>
hing. By the way that GNP is a false alarm, with Uncle Sam playing<lb/>
the game of sucker.</p>
<p>The Cubans have been constantly reminding us of the sacrifices<lb/>
they made during the recent World Conflict. What were those &ldquo;sacri-<lb/>
fices&rdquo;? Selling us their sugar at prices they had never dreamed of<lb/>
obtaining. Every mortgaged sugar plantation and sugar mill was able<lb/>
to pay off their mortgages, pay handsome dividends and build up a<lb/>
reserve. Let me here state a fact. There was not a financially sound<lb/>
sugar plantation or mill on the Island when World War II started. All<lb/>
except the American-owned sugar mills were bankrupt. And yet a lot of<lb/>
Americans swallow that &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; propaganda. In fine, the Good-<lb/>
Neighbor-Policy has been a Santa Claus for the Latin Americans, with<lb/>
Cuba one of its most favored beneficiares.</p>
<p>With reference to the &ldquo;caseta&rdquo;. The charcoal vendor and his<lb/>
wife roped it to nearby trees before the hurricane arrived. The Govern-<lb/>
ment cared little what might happen to it. The $50,000 appropriated<lb/>
for the &ldquo;memorial&rdquo; and situated by the Ministry of Finance &ldquo;evaporated&rdquo;<lb/>
between the Treasury and Public Works. Presumably it forms a part of<lb/>
the $174,000,000 illegally disposed of by President Grau San Martin and<lb/>
his ministers during the four years ended October 10, 1948, now being<lb/>
aired before the Supreme Court of Cuba, Criminal Section. Since loot-<lb/>
ing of the public treasury has become an institution in Cuba, few of<lb/>
the natives believe that Grau &amp; Company will be found guilty or obliged<lb/>
to restore their ill-gotten millions. They will continue to enjoy<lb/>
their loot and will suffer no loss of their civil rights, nor will<lb/>
they be ostracised by their fellows. Their social functions will be<lb/>
attended by the elite and envied by those who cannot afford the luxury<lb/>
of spending $10,000 to $50,000 on a banquet. Grau, of course, did<lb/>
not, personally, steal any of the missing millions. His sister-in-law,<lb/>
who acted as the First Lady of the Land, collected more than a fair<lb/>
share of the spoils for both, she being a widow and he being a bachellor.</p>
<p>You will be arriving at the conclusion that I am too severe<lb/>
on the Cubans. I am not judging them by my own code of morals but by<lb/>
what I imagine your moral code is, a code that is common to most<lb/>
decent and honorable Americans. You will be wondering why I have<lb/>
continued to live among them since my retirement. The answer is simple.<lb/>
I have spent so many years of my life away from God's Country, 20 of<lb/>
them here in Havana, that to settle down in a temperate zone would<lb/>
impose great hardship upon me. Also, here my wife has formed her own<lb/>
limited circle and <hi>five of her brothers and sisters live in Havana</hi>.<lb/>
She would miss Havana much more than I would. Plenty of good reading<lb/>
material is sufficient company for me, plus radio and an occasional<lb/>
bridge game. She, naturally, wants her circle of friends.</p>
<p><hi>I am not destrying the memoirs I have prepared</hi>. If I should<lb/>
survive Elida, the manuscript will be yours for whatever it may be worth.<lb/>
If she survives me, it will be hers, to do with as she pleases. So far<lb/>
as your own work on Yellow Fever is concerned, I can contribute nothing<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f04302003"/>
<hi>Dr. Philip S. Hench</hi>.<lb/>
-- 3 --<lb/>
<hi>Feb. 5, 1949.</hi><lb/>
which you do not already know from my voluminous correspondence with<lb/>
you over a period of almost twelve years, to be exact, since July,<lb/>
1937. How time flies when one has passed the half-century mark!</p>
<p>I have not forgotten your request for a photograph of my<lb/>
Congressional Medal. I will go to the bank one of these days and<lb/>
take it out to have it photographed, as per your instructions, on a<lb/>
dark velvet or dark background. If I had had the medal in my house<lb/>
you would have received the photograph long ago. So far as your other<lb/>
unfinished business in Cuba is concerned, I hope Dr. Noguera will be<lb/>
able to help you out. He can do much more than I can in the matter<lb/>
of photostatic copies of newspaper articles which you are anxious to<lb/>
add to your collection of data. He told me several months ago that<lb/>
he could arrange to have the newspapers taken to the photographer,<lb/>
a privilege which was denied me. Also, since you must still be<lb/>
interested, he will be able to inform you as to the chances of having<lb/>
the memorial at Camp Lazear revived under the present administration.<lb/>
Do you have any recent letters from Dr. Nogueira in connection with<lb/>
this project and with that of the photostats?</p>
<p>I hope you will have the patience to read this long-winded<lb/>
letter, most of which is devoted to topics which can interest you<lb/>
but little. In a way, it may prepare you for some of the unfavorable<lb/>
comment which your History of Yellow Fever is sure to encounter at<lb/>
the hands of the Cubans, regardless of how well Finlay may fare at<lb/>
your hands. No matter how much you may laud Finlay, if you do justice<lb/>
to Reed, you will be damned by the diehards here, and they are many.</p>
<p>I have not the slightest doubt that you will give Reed all<lb/>
the credit to which his memory is entitled, which is more than could<lb/>
be expected of me, in that I am prejudiced in his favor as opposed<lb/>
to the Cuban claims for Finlay, an admission the existence of which<lb/>
has been well known to you for many years. It would be hypocrisy on<lb/>
my part to proclaim that I honor the memory of Finlay on a par with<lb/>
that of Reed, although my memoirs claim an equal division of the<lb/>
glory as between the two immortals. In doing that, I have certainly<lb/>
been magnanimous to Finlay and his memory. Perhaps my lack of contact<lb/>
with Finlay during the experiments carried out at Camp Lazear will<lb/>
account for this discrepancy. To this day I cannot vision Finlay as<lb/>
a Cuban. <hi>He was accidentally born here of European parents, but he<lb/>
did not have a drop of Cuban or Spanish blood in his veins.</hi></p>
<p>Well, allow me to draw this rambling letter to a close and<lb/>
to cease torturing you with thoughts and sentiments which can be of<lb/>
little interest to you. Pardon my effusions and ascribe some of<lb/>
<hi>them to my 73 years</hi>, grey hairs and state of my health.</p>
<p>With love from Elida and myself to Mary, the youngsters and<lb/>
yourself, I remain,</p>
<closer>
