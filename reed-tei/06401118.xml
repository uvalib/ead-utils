<salute>My dear Colonel Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was greatly pleased to get<lb/>
your night-letter which came an<lb/>
hour or two ago and your message<lb/>
of congratulation to Gen Truby<lb/>
gave him, I am sure, a thrill of pride<lb/>
and satisfaction. He appreciates<lb/>
as I do that it was your zeal and<lb/>
tireless researches that was the<lb/>
motive power which put us par-<lb/>
ticipants in this episode to work<lb/>
to do our part in this review, It is<lb/>
well that you took it up when you did<lb/>
for I was 84 last month, and the num-<lb/>
ber grows less each year of those who<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06401119"/>
2<lb/>
knew Walter Reed and his assistants-<lb/>
This morning's paper <unclear>mentions</unclear> the funer-<lb/>
al at Arlington yesterday of Clyde L.<lb/>
West- He was one of the last three cases<lb/>
of experimental y. f. at Camp Lazear and<lb/>
was sick of it at the time that - Reed<lb/>
read his paper before the Pan-American<lb/>
Medical Congress at Havana Feb. 4-7, 1901.<lb/>
He had a mild case- He was a member<lb/>
of Truby &amp; Hospital Corps Detachment<lb/>
which furnished most of the volunteers<lb/>
at Camp Lazear- I note that the news-<lb/>
papers speak of him as &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; West but<lb/>
where and how he got the title I do not<lb/>
know- I do not think he ever studied<lb/>
medecine- If the gas situation had not<lb/>
been so difficult here I would have<lb/>
asked Gen. Ireland to take me out<lb/>
to his funeral- Truby enjoyed so much<lb/>
your visit to San Francisco last April-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06401120"/>
3<lb/>
and I was so glad that you too got<lb/>
together at last- He was concerned<lb/>
that Laura Wood's book, Walter Reed<lb/>
Doctor in Uniform came out before his<lb/>
as she had made some references and<lb/>
quotations from his U S S. but I wrote<lb/>
him I did did not think it made<lb/>
any difference or that his publisher<lb/>
would make any <unclear>fuss</unclear> over it- She<lb/>
gave him full credit, and her book<lb/>
was printed three months sooner than<lb/>
she anticipated- Have you read it?<lb/>
I wrote her that you should have a<lb/>
copy sent you, and I would like to<lb/>
know how you like it- It is not inten-<lb/>
ded to be a scientific work but to be<lb/>
popular and for young readers- I<lb/>
think she made a good job of it-<lb/>

We have had a very hot summer but<lb/>
Mrs Kean and I have been getting<lb/>
along quite well, tho we have had some<lb/>
trouble with domestic service which<lb/>
is much upset here by the reckless<lb/>
employment of the colored population<lb/>
at huge wages and very little <unclear>referance</unclear><lb/>
as to their qualifications by the U. S. Gov.<lb/>
It seems to be one element in what the<lb/>
New Dealers call their social gains-<lb/>
We keep relatively cool by spending much<lb/>
of our time in the basement and we<lb/>
sleep there in a back room looking<lb/>
out into the garden. Our prevaling<lb/>
wind here in summer is from the<lb/>
south and so. west and we have the<lb/>
Potomac only half a mile to the south<lb/>
of us here in Georgetown- I was glad<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06401122"/>
5<lb/>
to hear, I think it was thru Mr Kellogg<lb/>
that you had a visit from Mrs<lb/>
Hench and the baby this spring-<lb/>
I hope you have arranged by this<lb/>
time to have satisfactory clerical<lb/>
assistance and can send me some<lb/>
further account of how your hospital<lb/>
administration gets on - and if you<lb/>
are able to maintain your wonderfully<lb/>
small death rate- We had a visitor<lb/>
at dinner last night a Captain <unclear>Greunan</unclear><lb/>
a Washington man from Johns Hopkins<lb/>
who has been a year and a half at<lb/>
Fort Bragg N. C. but is now with Gen. Hosp.<lb/>
No. 56 in S. C- He is up here taking a<lb/>
refresher course in tropical medecine<lb/>
at the Army Medical School and says<lb/>
it is a wonderful course &amp; full of meat-</p>
<pb n="6" id="f06401123"/>
<p>Ac<lb/>
k</p>
<p>He thinks they will go abroad before<lb/>
long, tho. of course they do not<lb/>
know anything- I met the new<lb/>
Surgeon General Gen. Kirk and<lb/>
his assistant Gen. Lull at luncheon<lb/>
recently- Gen. Ireland &amp; Ruther-<lb/>
ford were the others and being<lb/>
old medical officers us talked of<lb/>
old times- Gen Ireland has<lb/>
an arthritic knee and is quite<lb/>
lame but never mentions it-<lb/>
I will let him see your telegram<lb/>
and we are both knew to see<lb/>
Truby's book actually in print-<lb/>
I have suggested to Truby to ask<lb/>
Russell (&ldquo;Who is Russell&rdquo;?) to review<lb/>
it for the Military Surgeon. Let me<lb/>
hear from you before too long-</p>
