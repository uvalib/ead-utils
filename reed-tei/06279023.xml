<salute>My dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your good letter was<lb/>
full of interesting and valua-<lb/>
ble information; and the kind<lb/>
things that you said about me<lb/>
were most gratifying to me<lb/>
I dont know why I have been<lb/>
so long in writing to tell you<lb/>
of the pleasure it gave me,<lb/>
except, though I dont have<lb/>
much to do, it takes me a long<lb/>
time to do it- I have not<lb/>
heard from Dr. Ramos since<lb/>
he returned <del>from</del><add>to</add> Cuba - When<lb/>
I do if he still is keen to put<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06279024"/>
<unclear>AC</unclear><lb/>
T<lb/>
put the tablet to Lazear at<lb/>
Las Animas, I will follow your<lb/>
suggestion and advise him to do<lb/>
so, as the temporary building in<lb/>
which Lazear kept his mos-<lb/>
quitoes &amp; had his little labora-<lb/>
tory at Columbia Bks Hospital<lb/>
has long ago disappeared-<lb/>
In view of the published state-<lb/>
ments about his infection and<lb/>
the fact that Lazear took the<lb/>
details with him to the grave<lb/>
it is best not to start any<lb/>
discussion-</p>
<p>Your intimate knowledge of the<lb/>
details of this thrilling and epo-<lb/>
chal episode has been of great<lb/>
value to me in completing my<lb/>
knowledge of them and confirm-<lb/>
ing and correcting my memory<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06279025"/>
3<lb/>
of them where the records were<lb/>
deficient- I would like to<lb/>
take your letter to Gen Reynolds<lb/>
and suggest that he put it on<lb/>
file with the voluminous corres-<lb/>
pondence that grew up over the<lb/>
&ldquo;Yellow Fever Roll of Honor&rdquo;, &amp; the<lb/>
various claims for recognition &amp;<lb/>
for <unclear>pensions</unclear> in connection with<lb/>
it- I would like first to have<lb/>
your permission to do so how-<lb/>
ever - Also I am a little shame<lb/>
faced because of the five things<lb/>
that you have to say in connec-<lb/>
tion with my efforts during more<lb/>
than 30 years to keep the record<lb/>
straight and honest- It makes<lb/>
me proud to have you say that<lb/>
I have succeeded so well-<lb/>

Of course without the constant<lb/>
and <unclear>unswerving talking</unclear> of<lb/>
Gen. Ireland it could not<lb/>
have been done, nor could I<lb/>
have the heart to keep at it<lb/>
if you, who knew, had not been<lb/>
always available to bear witness<lb/>
to the facts in your clear and<lb/>
fearless way- General Ireland<lb/>
knows that my memory is not<lb/>
as good as his (or yours) and<lb/>
perhaps might have hesitated<lb/>
to oppose demands backed by<lb/>
<unclear>Representative</unclear> and Senators<lb/>
including at times the heads<lb/>
of the two military Committees<lb/>
if you had not always sus-<lb/>
tained me- Now I think that<lb/>
things are pretty safe, even in-<lb/>

the demands of that very clever<lb/>
and good looking widow Mrs<lb/>
Roger P. Ames &amp; her <unclear>backer</unclear> Sena-<lb/>
tor Sheppard, but it is just as<lb/>
well to have your statement on<lb/>
file as what the French call a<lb/>
<hi>piece justicative</hi>-</p>
<p>Gen. Ireland is away as he has<lb/>
been most of the spring but expects<lb/>
to be back for a few weeks about<lb/>
the middle of June- He will be<lb/>
here for a day on May 28 when<lb/>
Gen Pershing is giving a great<lb/>
dinner to those who sailed with<lb/>
him on the Baltic May 28 1917-<lb/>
He is coming last for that sole<lb/>
purpose as he naturally would<lb/>

not miss it- If you come east<lb/>
be sure to let me know at once<lb/>
I go out so little that my best<lb/>
friends may be in town and<lb/>
I may not hear of it unless<lb/>
they let me know-</p>
<p>Mrs Kean joins me in cordial<lb/>

I am always</p>
