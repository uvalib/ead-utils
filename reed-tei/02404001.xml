<salute>My own sweet <unclear>&ldquo;oomsley&rdquo;:</unclear></salute>
</opener>
<p>Two<lb/>
letters, today, from the sweetest,<lb/>
<unclear>fattest</unclear> lady in all the land,<lb/>
to whom her &ldquo;<unclear>Mantee</unclear>&rdquo; owes<lb/>
so <hi>many apologies</hi> for <unclear>intimating</unclear><lb/>
or even hinting that her sweet<lb/>
<hi>cuticle</hi> should<del>d</del> have <hi><unclear>ever</unclear></hi> con-<lb/>
tained the <hi>very <unclear>fanitest trace</unclear></hi><lb/>
of Johannes Barley <unclear>Corn</unclear>! Did I,<lb/>
in the excess of my youthful, 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
Century fun, lovie, dear, say<lb/>
that my precious joy had<lb/>
filled her &ldquo;<unclear>outer coat</unclear>&rdquo; with<lb/>
<unclear>ye</unclear> dizzy &ldquo;<unclear>Tanglefoat</unclear>&rdquo;? &ldquo;<unclear>Heaving</unclear>&rdquo;<lb/>
forgive me, if I did! for in truth,<lb/>
fair lady of the <unclear>sonty</unclear> &ldquo;hoof&rdquo;, I<lb/>
meant no <unclear>aspension</unclear> upon your<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02404002"/>
fair &amp; spotless integument! <unclear>Faires</unclear><lb/>
apology I cannot wake!<lb/>
Well, Well! what has got into my<lb/>
dumpling day Farmer-lady's<lb/>
cranium again. One letter<lb/>
so joyful and cheerful, and the<lb/>
other &ldquo;<unclear>sorter</unclear>&rdquo; inclined to &ldquo;toss<lb/>
up the sponge&rdquo;! And all be-<lb/>
cause Mrs. Sternberg, who does-<lb/>
n't know what she is talking<lb/>
about, happened to make a<lb/>
playful remark! Well, dearest<lb/>
<unclear>Heart</unclear>, how many times have<lb/>
I told you that you musn't<lb/>
pay any attention to anything<lb/>
anybody else says about<lb/>
<hi>my</hi> movements! I have already<lb/>
said that I am coming home<lb/>
right after the adjournment<lb/>
of the Pan-American Congress,<lb/>
<hi>and I mean every word of<lb/>
it</hi>! Do you get <hi>that through</hi><lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02404003"/>
your sweet &ldquo;<unclear>noddle</unclear>&rdquo;? If so, just<lb/>
put it in your pipe and smoke<lb/>
it! <hi>Sunday afternoon</hi>- A beau-<lb/>
tiful, though somewhat windy,<lb/>
day after a night of hard<lb/>
rain; but everything looks<lb/>
so fresh and refreshed. Now,<lb/>
sweetheart, there are just two<lb/>
things I want to talk to you<lb/>
about - <hi>one</hi>, the question<lb/>
of the <hi>mosquitoes</hi> getting<lb/>
<hi>out</hi> of our building. In<lb/>
the first place, <hi>they can't<lb/>
get out</hi>. Did you think that<lb/>
<hi>your</hi> old mosquito was <hi>so<lb/>
silly</hi> as not to take <hi>every</hi><lb/>
precaution against their<lb/>
escape? How utterly <unclear>ground-<lb/>
less</unclear> such fears are! We<lb/>
don't forget that a mosqui-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02404004"/>
-to &ldquo;can sit on the edge of a<lb/>
door&rdquo;! We <hi>don't</hi> let him <hi>sit</hi><lb/>
there. Before that door is<lb/>
opened, <hi>I</hi>, standing on the<lb/>
<hi>other</hi> side of the <unclear>wire-par-<lb/>
tition</unclear> can <unclear>minutely</unclear> inspect<lb/>
this door, which is thorough-<lb/>
ly shaken before being op-<lb/>
ened. If when this door was<lb/>
opened, an insect would<lb/>
escape, he would find him-<lb/>
self, or rather <hi>herself</hi>, in<lb/>
a small vestibule all lived<lb/>
with white &amp; protected by<lb/>
<hi>another</hi> screen-door, &amp; a <hi>man</hi><lb/>
with a test-tube ready to<lb/>
<hi>tube</hi> her <hi>at once</hi> &amp; put her<lb/>
back into <unclear>capacity</unclear><del><unclear></unclear></del>!. If she got<lb/>
through the <hi>second</hi> door, she<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02404005"/>
would find herself in <hi>another</hi><lb/>
vestibule lived with white<lb/>
Cheese cloth &amp; protected<lb/>
by a <hi>third</hi> screen-door, &amp;<lb/>
<hi>another</hi> man with <hi>another</hi><lb/>
tube to catch her! Now<lb/>
do you see, lovie, dear, that<lb/>
there is <hi>absolutely no</hi><lb/>
danger of <unclear>their</unclear> escape?<lb/>
Please, therefore, do pray <unclear>brace</unclear><lb/>
up and don't worry <del>about</del><lb/>
any more about <hi>loaded</hi><lb/>
mosquitoes <unclear>wonder<del>e</del>ing</unclear><lb/>
around all over our Camp!<lb/>
If we, didn't take the pre-<lb/>
caution to see that our<lb/>
infected insects did not<lb/>
escape, why what would<lb/>
<unclear>one</unclear> other experiments <unclear>amount</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02404006"/>
to? <hi>absolutely nothing</hi>!<lb/>
Another thing, sweetheart;<lb/>
you suggest coming down<lb/>
on the next Transport for<lb/>
a short visit. Now nothing<lb/>
would give me greater<lb/>
delight and it is a matter<lb/>
over which I have thought<lb/>
a good deal<unclear>-</unclear> and tried to<lb/>
think how it could be<lb/>
done safely &amp; for your<lb/>
comfort &amp; pleasure. I<lb/>
wish I could just say,<lb/>
&ldquo;Come right along without<lb/>
hesitating&rdquo;: but I can't<lb/>
say so. Firstly, the voyage<lb/>
would be more than you<lb/>
could endure in <unclear>shafe-<lb/>
rooms</unclear> that are poorly<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02404007"/>
heated. At this season, the<lb/>
<unclear>Atlantic</unclear> is so rough that I<lb/>
<unclear>dread</unclear> the voyage home and<lb/>
think of it as a thing <add>that</add> <hi>must</hi><lb/>
be endured. Therefore if<lb/>
you conclude to come, we<lb/>
won't return till the middle<lb/>
of April, as I couldn't let<lb/>
you go <unclear>right</unclear> back from<lb/>
Cuba into the cold winter<lb/>
of the U. S.- If you hadn't been<lb/>
sick, I would say &ldquo;alright&rdquo;,<lb/>
but I do consider it risky<lb/>
under the circumstances. <hi>If</hi><lb/>
it wasn't for the <unclear><hi rend="superscript">$</hi>250</unclear> of the<lb/>
Columbian salary that I can<lb/>
make by returning in February,<lb/>
I would say come &amp; we will<lb/>
stay till April or May, but<lb/>
as it is, I think that I should<lb/>
come back. Just where or<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02404008"/>
how I could mess us, I don't<lb/>
know. Certainly not in<lb/>
my present mess, for I would-<lb/>
n't think, for one moment, of<lb/>
allowing you to join it. It is<lb/>
simply out of the question.<lb/>
So that under all of the circum-<lb/>
stances, I should advise you<lb/>
not to come, but to wait until<lb/>
we can arrange a visit at<lb/>
some later day. If, however,<lb/>
lovie, dear, you still conclude<lb/>
to come, write &amp; tell me, and I<lb/>
will be on hand to give you<lb/>
the warmest welcome pos-<lb/>
sible &amp; will do everything to<lb/>
make your stay happy and pleas-<lb/>
ant. Think over it carefully<lb/>
&amp; tell me by return mail<lb/>
what you will do. I am sorry<lb/>
that a better boat than the <unclear>Raw-<lb/>
lins</unclear> doesn't leave New York<lb/>
on the next trip, Jan. 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>,<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02404009"/>
why does my precious wifie<lb/>
almost &ldquo;put her eyes&rdquo; with<lb/>
reading <hi>without</hi> glasses, when<lb/>
she could be so comfortable<lb/>
<hi>with</hi> glasses? Get you a<lb/>
pair of <hi>spectacles</hi>, you pretty<lb/>
thing, &amp; let me see you with<lb/>
them perched up on your <unclear>darl-<lb/>
ing</unclear> nose! You would look<lb/>
just as handsome as a<lb/>
picture! That was a nice<lb/>
compliment that Beehner<lb/>
said my precious oomsey!<lb/>
He knows a pretty woman<lb/>
when he sees her - of course<lb/>
he does! I have been over<lb/>
to the Stark's to dinner to-<lb/>
night, Sunday, &amp; enjoyed some<lb/>
broiled spring chicken<lb/>
so very much, with cu-<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02404010"/>
-cumbers- Poor sweetheart who<lb/>
can't eat these things! But<lb/>
dearest, I really think it very<lb/>
absurd that you can't eat<lb/>
all the <hi>rice</hi> you want- I<lb/>
don't care if <del>yo</del> there is<lb/>
lots of <hi><unclear>starch</unclear></hi> in it - you<lb/>
can't live on water and<lb/>
milk all of your days. Do<lb/>
pray take a little honest food<lb/>
once in a while- By the way<unclear>,</unclear><lb/>
the <hi>cake</hi> has <hi>arrived</hi>! Old<lb/>
mother Greer's very best, and it<lb/>
is just as nice as it can<lb/>
be. I am so much obliged to<lb/>
my precious heart for sending<lb/>
it to me. I shall &ldquo;<unclear>muuch</unclear>&rdquo; a<lb/>
slice of it every night until<lb/>
it is all gone. It will last<lb/>
me almost until I am ready<lb/>
to start home, which wont<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f02404011"/>
be long now - only about <hi>5</hi><lb/>
weeks, pretty picture- Keep<lb/>
up your good spirits and<lb/>
don't forget how to use the<lb/>
chafing dish, for we must<lb/>
have some oysters <hi>certainly</hi>-<lb/>
some fat, nice, juicy ones!<lb/>
How is that precious lamb?<lb/>
and what does she say about<lb/>
her trip to An<add>n</add>apolis? Did she<lb/>
almost dance herself to<lb/>
death? Has she gotten back<lb/>
to her books again? And her<lb/>
music? Bless her darling heart<lb/>
how father wishes to see<lb/>
his precious girls again!<lb/>
They have been such good<lb/>
patient children during<lb/>
papa's absence. Well, I<lb/>
hear tattoo <unclear>sounding</unclear> and<lb/>
it is getting to be about<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f02404012"/>
time to &ldquo;turn in&rdquo; and take <unclear>yes</unclear><lb/>
gentle &ldquo;snooze&rdquo;. Goodnight, my<lb/>
precious babies. Wake up<lb/>
early in the morning, like real<lb/>
good children. <hi>Boo</hi>! <hi>Boo</hi>!!<lb/>
<hi>Monday morning - 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>- Jerusalem!<lb/>
but I came near oversleeping<lb/>
myself, and then what <unclear>would</unclear><lb/>
my sweet Miss Gouty have done<lb/>
without her letter? I suppose<lb/>
she would have sat down &amp; cried!<lb/>
Have you met anybody else,<lb/>
lovie, dear, who told you all<lb/>
about how long I would yet<lb/>
stay in Cuba? Please don't<lb/>
listen to the idle <unclear>prating</unclear> of<lb/>
every one whom you meet at a<lb/>
<unclear>tea</unclear>. Just put a little confidence<lb/>
in your M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mantee, &amp; you will soon<lb/>
see him back and fairly crowd-<lb/>
ing Miss Farmer-lady out of her<lb/>
beautiful Room! He! He! Ha! Ha!<lb/>
Love and Kisses &amp; Kisses &amp; love<lb/>
for my own precious girls.</p>
