<salute>My dear Mr. and Mrs. Kissinger:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I ought to have thanked you for your letter and<lb/>
telegram of the 16th, but we have been so busy in your<lb/>
behalf that I could not seem to find time to do it.<lb/>
You will see by the enclosed the steps we have taken.<lb/>
Eleven hundred dollars and more of contributions are in<lb/>
the Central Trust Company here in New York awaiting our<lb/>
disbursements. You will not be disappointed, we hope,<lb/>
when we explain how things must be done. When a drive<lb/>
of this sort is made, every contributor must receive an<lb/>
acknowledgement from a recognized organization and must<lb/>
be assured that every cent will be spent by an authorized<lb/>
agent well known to the public. The American Association<lb/>
for Medical Progress of which Dr. Gruenberg is Managing<lb/>
Director is sending the <unclear>receipts</unclear> and banking the money.<lb/>
We have more than enough to make you and Mr. Kissinger<lb/>
comfortable during the <unclear>period</unclear> of any operation you may<lb/>
have to undergo. We have communicated with the Red<lb/>
Cross organization in your vicinity and they will help<lb/>
you in any way you wish, and will settle for all bills<lb/>
(receiving our check for these expenditures), so you<lb/>
will not need to worry about finance.</p>
<p>If you have not already made a decision about what<lb/>
is best for you to do in regard to the diagnoses of the<lb/>
doctors. I hope you can delay any treatment until we<lb/>
can communicate with Dr. Kelly. You know he is an expert<lb/>
along these lines. Perhaps you can hasten his counsel<lb/>
if you write him at once what each of your Doctors say.<lb/>
Where is the fibroid tumor located (stomach, ovary, womb)?<lb/>
Be sure to write him all the details you know. His address<lb/>
is 1406 <unclear>Eutaw</unclear> Place, Baltimore, Maryland Better send<lb/>
by special delivery.</p>
<p>I am enclosing a letter from Mr. Charles A. Tyler,<lb/>
Asst General Manager of the Philadelphia Public Ledger.<lb/>
Wouldn't it be a coincidence, if, as he thinks, you and<lb/>
he went to school together<unclear>:</unclear> Please be sure to let us<lb/>
know at once where you were born (I am sorry I cannot<lb/>
find the statement you have already sent me), where you<lb/>
went to school, how far you went in school, the <hi>year</hi>,<lb/>
month, and day of your birth, and as full an account of<lb/>
your ancestry and the experiences of your boyhood and<lb/>
youth as you are willing to give. You understand we do<lb/>
not wish to pry into your private affairs, but the<lb/>

March 30, 1927<lb/>
newspapers and magazines are running your story pretty<lb/>
widely, and we wish to keep things as straight as possible.<lb/>
The International News Service, for instance, had in<lb/>
their first copy a <unclear>statement</unclear> like the following. &ldquo;Mr.<lb/>
Kissinger's brave <hi>little</hi> (not quite according to fact<lb/>
is it!) wife took in washings <hi>all these years</hi>, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope the arrangements we are trying to make<lb/>
will be pleasing to you, and that you will not think we<lb/>
are trying to dictate as to your future. If we can only<lb/>
be sure that your coming years are years of comfort,<lb/>
and that <hi>no other Kissinger</hi> will be neglected <unclear>by</unclear> for<lb/>
twenty-seven years by the country he has served so nobly,<lb/>
our labor of love will not be in vain. Please<lb/>
return Mr. Tyler's letter, and write special delivery,<lb/>
addressing me 93 Carhart Avenue, White Plains, N.Y.</p>
<p>With very best wishes,</p>
