<salute>Dearest Mumsie,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was so glad<lb/>
to get your letter of<lb/>
the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> yesterday, for<lb/>
my last news of you<lb/>
was your letter of the<lb/>
12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. I have been quite<lb/>
worried about you, and<lb/>
was watching most<lb/>
anxiously for a letter<lb/>
telling me how you were,<lb/>
and I really think one<lb/>
of those good-for-nothing<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14313002"/>
girls might have sent<lb/>
me a line on the subject.</p>
<p>None of the things<lb/>
have come yet, but I<lb/>
think they are all on<lb/>
the transport that is<lb/>
in today. Your blue<lb/>
skirt will do finely<lb/>
for my trip north, and<lb/>
it is very good of you<lb/>
to give it to me. Do<lb/>
keep my new dress safe<lb/>
at home, for I have no<lb/>
earthly use for it, and<lb/>
it sounds as if it were<lb/>
very pretty. I am sorry<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14313003"/>
to say that yesterday, before your<lb/>
letter came I gave my pink <unclear>divinity</unclear> to<lb/>
Rufinia's daughter to make up for<lb/>
me. You see I did not know what<lb/>
you had sent me, or if I could<lb/>
have the seamstress as soon as I<lb/>
arrived, and, as I had planned to<lb/>
go to Molly so soon. I was afraid to<lb/>
wait any longer lest I should slip<lb/>
up at both ends of the line, and, as<lb/>
I have so few clothes I was afraid<lb/>
to risk it. However I shall need<lb/>
the woman to make me one or two<lb/>
simple evening dresses, for I have none<lb/>
at all, and some <unclear>matinee's.</unclear> I guess<lb/>
we can plan those when I get home<lb/>
<unclear>tho',</unclear> and if this little French girl<lb/>
turns out to be of any account, she<lb/>
can make up one or two more things<lb/>
for which I have the material.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14313004"/>
I wonder if I will<lb/>
get my cape, for I have<lb/>
no wrap at all. Mrs.<lb/>
Lee has kindly offered<lb/>
me an extra cape she<lb/>
has, if mine does not<lb/>
arrive, but I trust you<lb/>
will get it on the<lb/>
<unclear>Sedgewick</unclear> as I suggested<lb/>
in my last letter.<lb/>
The quarantine does not<lb/>
go on until the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>,<lb/>
and, even if we did<lb/>
not get away before<lb/>
then, we would not<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14313005"/>
have to be out five<lb/>
days, for there are <add>a</add> few<lb/>
nice, clean places in<lb/>
Cuba which will be<lb/>
excepted from that rule<lb/>
for some time, and, of<lb/>
course, Quemados is one<lb/>
of them. So we will be<lb/>
neither fumigated or<lb/>
detained.</p>
<p>Rannie is dreadfully<lb/>
busy now, with his or-<lb/>
phans and civil hospitals<lb/>
and the first of the<lb/>
month he is on the<lb/>
board to examine can-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14313006"/>
didates for the regular corps. Which<lb/>
is very annoying, as he will have<lb/>
to spend a large part of his time<lb/>
in town the last few days I am<lb/>
here.</p>
<p>May Myrick lunched with me yester-<lb/>
day. They are planning to spend<lb/>
the summer. Tonight Rannie and<lb/>
I dine with the Heards.</p>
<p>Martha is very well, and getting more<lb/>
resigned to the idea of her voyage,<lb/>
tho' we cannot persuade her she<lb/>
will not be sick. When the things<lb/>
come from the transport I will write<lb/>
again. I hope you are not still laid<lb/>
up with that wretched cold, dear Mumsie</p>
