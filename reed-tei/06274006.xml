<salute>My dear Mrs. Ames:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of the 16th and can well understand your fe<del>l</del><add>e</add>ling that the<lb/>
memory of your fine husband, Dr. Roger Post Ames, should not be forgotten in any<lb/>
discussion of the conquest of yellow fever in Cuba. I know very well how devoted<lb/>
and valuable were his services to us all in that gloomy year, 1900, when we were<lb/>
facing an apparently hopeless fight with yellow fever in Cuba. Dr. Ames, being<lb/>
expert in the diagnosis and treatment of yellow fever, was a great help to us in<lb/>
those days. Besides my recognition of the value of his services, I have a strong<lb/>
felling of gratitude to him for his good care of me when I suffered with an attack<lb/>
of that disease. I think, however, that you have been mininformed as to the scope<lb/>
of the recent legislation. I have never heard that it was the intention of Congress<lb/>
that (as you say) &ldquo;all of those who assisted in the yellow fever work in Cuba were<lb/>
to receive recognition at the hands of the government.&rdquo; In fact the beneficiaries<lb/>
of the bill are limited to the members of the Board (or their widows), and the<lb/>
Americans who volunteered to submit to the experiments of the Board. Not even all<lb/>
of these are included, but only those who had an attack of experimental yellow<lb/>
fever, or who went through what Reed called &ldquo;the trying ordeal&rdquo; of sleeping twenty<lb/>
nights in the infected bedding. Those who offered themselves for experiment and<lb/>
were bitten by infected mosquitoes, but did not have an attack of yellow fever<lb/>
were not included. The Spaniards who submitted to the experiments, even though<lb/>
they suffered attacks of yellow fever were not included. Even of those who were<lb/>
mentioned in the report of the Secretary of War, Hon. Elihu Root, for 1902 as having<lb/>
rendered distinguished service in the conquest of yellow fever, two are not men-<lb/>
tioned in this legislation. In view of these facts I think you will agree with me<lb/>
that it would have been impossible to have brought in the name of Dr. Ames not-<lb/>
withstanding his fine work in the care of the yellow fever sick. His children will<lb/>
have no reason to feel that his ommission from this Act is in any way a reflection<lb/>
upon his service in Cuba which is held in grateful remembrance by his old friends<lb/>
and comrades who served with him in the dark days of 1899 and 1900. I am enclosing<lb/>
you a copy of the Act.</p>
<p>I have shown your letter and this reply to the Surgeon General of the Army and<lb/>
he entirely concurs with me in what I have stated above.</p>
<p>With all good wishes, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>

Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired</signed>
