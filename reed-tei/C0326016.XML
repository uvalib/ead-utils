<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I did not have a chance to write to you last week, as I<lb/>
went to Baltimore on Thursday, to stay with the Frost's, and re-<lb/>
mained over the week-end. I took all my remaining material in<lb/>
connection with the History of Yellow Fever: MS. bibliographic<lb/>
cards, books which I thought Frost would wish to see etc. etc. Did<lb/>
no routine work with him, however, although we had two very satisfactory<lb/>
<add>talks,</add> during the latter of which he, to some extent, went over my re-<lb/>
maining file of bibliographic references, nearly all of which were<lb/>
verified long since and are now mainly recast and retyped for his<lb/>
greater convenience. Dr. Frost told me that I had been doing &ldquo;good<lb/>
work.&rdquo; That it <hi>is</hi> good work, is due as much to Miss Brown as to<lb/>
myself, however. She is devoted and indefatigable.</p>
<p>Dr. Frost also told me that he hoped to be able to again<lb/>
take up the final editing of Father's MS intensively about the middle<lb/>
of March and added that he would have no use for my material in the<lb/>
interim. I therefor brought it all back with me and will continue<lb/>
to still further work up the bibliographic cards as, although all of<lb/>
the essential ones have been verified (and nearly all of the others)<lb/>
I can still do a good deal to make them clearer, thus expediting Dr.<lb/>
Frost's work when he resumes<del>,</del> it. Also, so long as there is any time<lb/>
remaining we want to clear up everything we possibly can in the way of<lb/>
references, even if not essential. Indeed, Miss Brown, by dint of<lb/>
practically reading several old Spanish books from cover to cover,<lb/>
&ldquo;tracked down&rdquo; three verbatim quotations while I was in Baltimore. A<lb/>
<unclear>[unclear]</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0326017"/>
them,<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
as we had no data to go on save the style <add>and context</add> of the quotation, the author<lb/>
not being given.</p>
<p>I wish that <add>you</add> could have been present at the Hopkins Commemora-<lb/>
tion Day exercises on February 22nd. Dr. Welch delivered the principal<lb/>
address, so it is needless to say that we enjoyed ourselves! The re-<lb/>
ception and luncheon at Homewood, a tea at the Howell's and a dinner<lb/>
at the Frost's that night completed the most festive day I've spent<lb/>
in a very long time, and one thoroughly delightful and worth-while.<lb/>
Still, I am more than glad to be &ldquo;back on the job,&rdquo; as I am too con-<lb/>
cerned with its completion to be willing to stay away from actual work<lb/>
<del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del>, save when, as in my recent trip, future plans have to be dis-<lb/>
cussed and our subsequent energies adapted accordingly.</p>
<p>With all manner of good wishes and hoping much that when next<lb/>
you start South you will get as far as Washington,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
