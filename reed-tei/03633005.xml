Senor Adrian Macia<lb/>
Manzana de Gomez No. 325<lb/>
Habana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Senor Macia:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I cannot tell you how greatly I appreciate your wonderful generosity<lb/>
in expressing your willingness to present to me as the <unclear>representative</unclear> of a small<lb/>
memorial committee, the remains of the historical wooden building on the San Jose<lb/>
farm where Major Walter Reed and his colleagues so ably proved the concept of<lb/>
Finlay. The story of the work of Finlay, ihis assistant, Delgado, and that of<lb/>
the United States Army Yellow Fever Commission, has always thrilled me, and I<lb/>
deem it a great privilege to have had a part in discovering, in this building,<lb/>
one of the few remaining symbols of their achievement. It is my hope that,<lb/>
among friends, I can raise at least a small sum of money to restore this little<lb/>
building and memorialize it, either on its present site, or perhaps, better yet,<lb/>
to have it removed to the grounds of the Military Hospital where the Cuban govern-<lb/>
ment plans to build a larger memorial. It will be wonderfully suitable to have<lb/>
this small building housed in a proper shrine and cared for for years to come.<lb/>
I believe also that the actual site where this building and the other small build-<lb/>
ings were should be memorialized in some way, and think the suggestion of Senor<lb/>
Pogolotti an excellent one; namely, ornamental concrete pillars connected with<lb/>
iron ornamental chains and in the center of the plot, perhaps a granite boulder<lb/>
with an appropriate bronze marker. Just how much these ventures will cost I do<lb/>
not yet know, but I shall do my best to raise the necessary funds among American<lb/>
friends, and present these memorials to the Cuban government. Let me assure you<lb/>
I have no ulterior motive whatever, but merely the effort to glorify those who<lb/>
contributed to the conquest of yellow fever.</p>
<p>Your own contribution in presenting the small building and a small plot<lb/>
of ground on that site to me for this purpose is a wonderful beginning to this<lb/>
venture. I shall be proud, indeed, to be the owner for a short time, in name<lb/>
only, of this historical spot. I have not had the privilege of hearing from you<lb/>
directly. If the above is truly your wish, I would be most grateful if you would<lb/>
send me an airmail special delivery with a brief message to that effect, using the<lb/>
enclosed envelope to reach me at the time of the dedication exercises, that I may<lb/>
announce your generous action on that occasion.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, most sincerely and gratefully yours,</salute>
</closer>
