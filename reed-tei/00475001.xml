AMORY HARE<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs Lazear:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Mr Dougherty of the<lb/>
Franklin Institute has sent me your<lb/>
gracious letter of December 27th, re-<lb/>
lative to my play HARD BARGAIN, which<lb/>
the Institute is considering putting<lb/>
on the air in a series of dramas portray-<lb/>
ing the dramatic incidents in the lives<lb/>
of great American men of Science.</p>
<p>The circumstances in con-<lb/>
nection with my writing this play are<lb/>
these:</p>
<p>My Father, Dr Hobart Amory Hare,<lb/>
immortalized for me the story of your<lb/>
husband's achievements while at Johns<lb/>
Hopkins, and when the news of his death<lb/>
reached him he told me the circumstances<lb/>
of it in a way that at once made Jesse<lb/>
Lazear the enshrined recollection of<lb/>
my youth.</p>
<p>When the world began to accept<lb/>
my work in poetry and fiction, I thought<lb/>
constantly of the day when I could con-<lb/>
sider myself sufficiently skilled in the<lb/>
use of English to do justice to the<lb/>
great theme offered in the facts of<lb/>
Lazear s sacrifice. And in 1932<lb/>
I began seeking such data as was available<lb/>
as a nucleus for the drama I was at-<lb/>
tempting to write.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00475002"/>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Dr Thayer was of enormous help<lb/>
to me due to the fact that he had<lb/>
personally known both you and Dr La-<lb/>
AMORY HARE zear and was possessed of much tech-<lb/>
nical information, as well as some<lb/>
notes of your husband's and some<lb/>
drawings of the intestines of the<lb/>
deadly mosquitos. Out of my talks<lb/>
with him I drew a sort of pattern or<lb/>
impression, and this was adapted to<lb/>
the needs of the stage.</p>
<p>I need hardly tell you that<lb/>
these needs are such that the play<lb/>
makes no pretense of being an his-<lb/>
torical document in the sequence of<lb/>
events governing Dr Lazear's life,<lb/>
but it, at the same time, is entire-<lb/>
ly authentic as to the salient oc-<lb/>
currences and events. I have had it<lb/>
read by many medical men besides<lb/>
Dr Thayer and Dr Young, Dr Packard,<lb/>
and Dr DeSchweinitz, all of whom have<lb/>
commended the technical authenticity<lb/>
and been unstinting in praise of the<lb/>
finished production.</p>
<p>Your own part in the story<lb/>
has been, of necessity, purely im-<lb/>
aginary, but Katharine Cornell was<lb/>
so moved by it that she wrote me<lb/>
regretting that it was not possible<lb/>
to create a female 'lead' in this<lb/>
drama, due to the fact that the story<lb/>
is obviously for an actor in the<lb/>
leading role.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00475003"/>
<p>3.</p>
<p>AMORY HARE Now comes the distressing part of<lb/>
why the play has not been produced.<lb/>
My agents, Pinker and Morrison, at<lb/>
once pronounced it a perfect script<lb/>
and at Miss Cornell's request, sent it<lb/>
to Mr McClintic. Mr McClintic wrote<lb/>
asking if he might keep it to reread,<lb/>
and again wrote in praise of it. He<lb/>
kept the play until one month before<lb/>
YELLOW JACK appeared, written by Mr<lb/>
McClintic and Mr Sidney Howard. While<lb/>
YELLOW JACK was in preparation the press<lb/>
published announcements that it would<lb/>
appear shortly, and that Mr Howard had<lb/>
intended writing the play for twenty<lb/>
years but had only recently been able<lb/>
to acquire sufficient data to undertake<lb/>
it.</p>
<p>Imagine my feelings when YELLOW JACK<lb/>
appeared and Dr Lazear was given no<lb/>
part whatsoever in the action. In this<lb/>
play the whole credit is given to<lb/>
Dr Reed.</p>
<p>I have been insuch a ferment of<lb/>
protest ever since that I have long since<lb/>
ceased worrying over my play's having<lb/>
become obsolete through the subject's<lb/>
being covered by YELLOW JACK. My agents<lb/>
have submitted the play to numberless<lb/>
actors and producers, all of whom ex-<lb/>
claim 'this is a far more powerful and<lb/>
human drama than YELLOW JACK---why was'<lb/>
nt it produced instead of YELLOW JACK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They have advised waiting until YEL-<lb/>
LOW JACK is not such a recent recollec-<lb/>
tion on Broadway, or producing HARD BAR-<lb/>
GAIN on a western circuit, as YELLOW JACK<lb/>
ran but three weeks, and never left<lb/>
NEw York. For my part I only want that<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00475004"/>
4.<lb/>
the American people shall know where<lb/>
AMORY HARE the credit belongs. And I am hoping<lb/>
that a production will ultimately<lb/>
be possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr Dougherty will send<lb/>
you the script, or I will have it sent<lb/>
direct from my agents. And I sincerely<lb/>
hope there will be nothing to offend<lb/>
your sensibilities in its portrayal.<lb/>
Without your approval of its release<lb/>
I could not consider its reaching the<lb/>
public, either on the air, or behind<lb/>
the footlights.</p>
<p>Please let me tell you with what<lb/>
a sense of relief I now possess your<lb/>
wherabouts. With your address in my<lb/>
pocket I feel somehow fortified in the<lb/>
hope of getting the recognition due<lb/>
Dr Lazear. Of him, it seems to me might<lb/>
be said what Sir Berkeley Moynihan<lb/>
said of Lawrence Oates who went with<lb/>
Scott to the Antarctic and walked de-<lb/>
liberately away to die alone in the icy<lb/>
wastes to lighten the burden of his<lb/>
comrades &ldquo;This was the greatest act<lb/>
of lonely heroism in the annals of<lb/>
our country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believe me,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed><hi>Amory Hare Hutchinson</hi></signed>
Mrs. J.P. Hutchinson<lb/>
</closer>
