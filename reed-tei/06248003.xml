France - <date value="1918-02-25">25 February 1918</date>
</dateline>
<salute>My dear General:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your note of January 14 reached me on February 22, having had the<lb/>
misfortune of a slow trip, as has been the luck of most of your letters.<lb/>
Today I had a letter from Allentown which was mailed on February 5.</p>
<p>I have already written you about General Pershing's sudden determina-<lb/>
tion to send me to the Headquarters, Line of Communications, as Chief<lb/>
Surgeon. About the time this order was issued there was a grand meeting<lb/>
of the General Staff at Headquarters, which determined that the Headquarters<lb/>
was too much overburdened with routine business to function properly and so<lb/>
was getting smothered in papers. They therefore made a radical recommenda-<lb/>
tion, which has been approved and carried out by General Pershing, to turn<lb/>
over his administrative staffs to General Kernan, Commanding the Line of<lb/>
Communications, and consolidate them with the corresponding divisions of<lb/>
General Kernan's staff. To correspond with these new functions, the<lb/>
name of the service is changed from Line of Communications to Service<lb/>
of the Rear. As this involves the moving of most of the officers and<lb/>
clerical force from Chaumont to Tours, Generals Bradley and Ireland came<lb/>
to Paris and came down with me to Tours by automobile, on Sunday, the<lb/>
17th. Therefore I reported to General Kernan as Chief Surgeon, L.O.C.,<lb/>
and General Bradley within half an hour afterwards reported to him as<lb/>
Chief Surgeon, A.E.F.; and I lost my new position immediately. I am now<lb/>
here as his principal assistant, the plan being that he will be absent<lb/>
a good deal, either with General Pershing or inspecting, and that I will<lb/>
act as Chief Surgeon, A.E.F., during his absence, being thus a sort of<lb/>
Deputy Chief Surgeon. A certain number of Bradley's assistants will be<lb/>
left on duty with the four sections of the General Staff at Headquarters,<lb/>
but most of them will come down here and this office will be <unclear>organised</unclear><lb/>
into divisions, much like the former organization of your office.</p>
<p>I of course regret leaving my fine little Ambulance Service with the<lb/>
French Army, which was just beginning to run smoothly and to be a joy:<lb/>
I have left it, however, in very safe and competent hands, with Percy<lb/>
Jones as Chief. I do not know of any man who handles men better and has<lb/>
better qualifications for this special service than Jones, and I hope that<lb/>
when Persons gets his Colonelcy in the regular service you will see that<lb/>
Jones gets the Colonelcy in the Ambulance Service which he will vacate.<lb/>
I think he will get along all right with Andrew, who really was beginning<lb/>
to pull in harness fairly well at the time I left. Andrew has charge of<lb/>
the most important division of the office, the motor transportation and<lb/>
motor supplies, and has been a good deal discouraged at the difficulties<lb/>
which the Quartermaster Department has made for him. They started out<lb/>
by insisting that it was their business to furnish spare parts, and so<lb/>
they refused to let our service make arrangements for so doing. Their<lb/>
next step was to steal all the spare parts which had been sent to us and<lb/>
distribute them through their own depot. Their third step has been to<lb/>
refuse to purchase in Paris a stock of spare parts to run on until their<lb/>
own supplies came in. They have only been willing to make piecemeal emer-<lb/>
gency purchases, with many delays and much fussing. I understand, however,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06248004"/>

2 - General Gorgas - 25 Feb 1918<lb/>
-----<lb/>
now that the 60 tons of spare parts for the Ambulance Service which ar-<lb/>
rived some weeks ago at Bordeaux are now in Paris, so the service will<lb/>
be on easy street for a while. The arrival of the 10 sections under<lb/>
Devereux, and the 17 under Metcalf has relieved the situation entirely<lb/>
as regards personnel. Devereux's sections, after assembling their cars<lb/>
at St. Nazaire, have come up and are now partly at the Base Camp and<lb/>
partly at the front. The others will follow soon.</p>
<p>We have not heard any details about the plan to send the sections<lb/>
remaining in the United States to Italy. It is my understanding that<lb/>
General Pershing does not view it with favor, but I got this at third-hand.<lb/>
As we have no troops in Italy it would involve the fitting out of a regular<lb/>
military expedition with a complete line of Quartermaster supplies, trans-<lb/>
portation, spare parts, etc., etc. This would have to be done, I suppose,<lb/>
by the Chief Quartermaster, AEF, and as they have been very hard up for<lb/>
supplies and transportation themselves they naturally do not view with any<lb/>
enthusiasm the fitting out of an Italian expedition.</p>
<p>Birmingham writes me the good news that there is every probability<lb/>
of our getting a half dozen medical Brigadiers for the service in France.<lb/>
I think that there are a number of quite suitable appointments for them<lb/>
here, as, for example, the surgeons of the different sections, which under<lb/>
the decentralization scheme will be given the authority of Department<lb/>
Chief Surgeons in the United States; and also the positions of supervision<lb/>
and control over the hospital centers, where groups of base hospitals will<lb/>
be collected which will receive a number of thousand patients. To command<lb/>
these centers will certainly be as important, and have as large administra-<lb/>
tive responsibilities as the commander of a brigade at the front.</p>
<p>Everyone is happy that the winter is nearing its end. While we have<lb/>
not had the unexampled severity of the winter in the United States, it<lb/>
has been cold, dark and gloomy, and all will be glad to see the sun.</p>
<p>Please reproach Furbush for having never written to me. I was<lb/>
greatly pleased to hear of Goodwin's fine promotion.</p>
<p>With cordial messages to all my friends in the office, I am,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
