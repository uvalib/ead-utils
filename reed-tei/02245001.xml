<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Will you<lb/>
excuse the use of a lead<lb/>
pencil? Somebody seems to have<lb/>
borrowed my ink, and so I<lb/>

am compelled to resort to<lb/>
a pencil- Here I am sitting<lb/>
in my shirt sleeves with<lb/>
the thermometer at 75&deg; at<lb/>
9 P.M.- I couldn't possibly<lb/>
find time to write yesterday<lb/>
in answer to your letter<lb/>
of Dec. 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- The day was so<lb/>
busily occupied with the<lb/>
affairs of our experimen-<lb/>
tal station that I was kept<lb/>
on the jump all day long.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02245002"/>
I had to smile at the advice<lb/>
that my darling wife was<lb/>
giving me about not trying<lb/>
to experiment <hi>now</hi>, but to<lb/>
postpone <hi>until next<lb/>
summer</hi>, &ldquo;when the mosquitoes<lb/>
have more vigor&rdquo;- When<lb/>
I read that, our <hi>fourth</hi><lb/>
man's eyes were getting<lb/>
<hi>redder</hi> and his temperature<lb/>
<hi>higher</hi>, and as far as <hi>I</hi> was<lb/>
was able to judge, the insect<lb/>
appeared to be &ldquo;getting in<lb/>
his work&rdquo; very well!<lb/>
What do you think of <hi>that</hi><lb/>
for winter experimentation?<lb/>
<hi>Four</hi> out of <hi>five</hi> inoculated<lb/>
coming down promptly?<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02245003"/>
Oh! my! but the last week<lb/>
has been an eventful one<lb/>
for your old Mr Mantee!<lb/>
And what is perfectly de-<lb/>
lightful, the first <hi>three</hi><lb/>
may be considered out<lb/>
of danger, while the fourth,<lb/>
only sick 24 hours, is<lb/>
doing as well as could<lb/>
be expected at this stage<lb/>
of the disease- This morn-<lb/>
ing, we again had the ex-<lb/>
perts out from Havana,<lb/>
and it was very amus-<lb/>
ing to see our three<lb/>
Spaniards all in a row,<lb/>
as it were, occupying<lb/>
their three beds, and look-<lb/>
ing (at least <hi>two</hi> of them)<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02245004"/>
quite contented over the<lb/>
near prospect of <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>200.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi><lb/>
in good american <hi>gold</hi>!<lb/>
our experiments have op-<lb/>
ened the eyes of all ar-<lb/>
ound- I sent a Cable to<lb/>
Gen. Sternberg, yesterday,<lb/>
and another, to-day,- I should<lb/>
not be surprised, if he<lb/>
really fell out of his chair!<lb/>
I wonder if the good news<lb/>
has made my precious<lb/>
wifie any better! I am<lb/>
so anxious to hear- My!<lb/>
but the first part of that<lb/>
last letter was as <hi>blue</hi><lb/>
as indigo!- like my joy's<lb/>
Sunday that she spoke<lb/>
of! How could I talk or<lb/>
arrange about coming<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02245005"/>
home, my precious joy,<lb/>
When I had my hands<lb/>
so very full of most im-<lb/>
portant work? Indeed,<lb/>
I don't want to come<lb/>
here <hi>next summer</hi>, if I<lb/>
can possibly get out of<lb/>
it- I had much rather<lb/>
finish now and have done<lb/>
with it- As matters stand<lb/>
now, I don't see how I<lb/>
can possibly finish my<lb/>
present work till the<lb/>
last of next month --<lb/>
and then comes the Pan-<lb/>
American Medical Cong-<lb/>
ress which meets Feb,<lb/>
5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> -- was postponed<lb/>
from Christmas week --<lb/>
and we should certainly<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02245006"/>
present a Short Report<lb/>
to the Congress, as it would<lb/>
be of the highest impor-<lb/>
tance to do so- Several<lb/>
hundred physicians from<lb/>
South America Mexico<lb/>
and many prominent men <add>from the U.S</add><lb/>
<del>would</del> <add>will</add> be here, and I am<lb/>
sure that we should not<lb/>
lose the opportunity of<lb/>
bringing to their prompt<lb/>
attention these most im-<lb/>
portant observations<lb/>
on yellow fever- The paper<lb/>
will attract more attention<lb/>
that any other that will<lb/>
be presented- I say this<lb/>
in all modesty- It's even<lb/>
more important to have<lb/>
ascertained how this<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02245007"/>
disease is propagated than<lb/>
to find the parasite that<lb/>
causes it -- our observations<lb/>
completely revolutionize<lb/>
the opinions heretofore<lb/>
held on the subject -- and must<lb/>
be of the greatest benefit<lb/>
to the U.S. and to this Island.<lb/>
Americans will no longer<lb/>
dread to come here, now<lb/>
that they will know how<lb/>
to avoid the infection.<lb/>
Now, I am hoping to hear<lb/>
what my darling wifie<lb/>
is going to say about her<lb/>
future movements -- whether<lb/>
you have made up your<lb/>
mind to come or not- If<lb/>
I had a good mess for<lb/>
you, I would urge you<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02245008"/>
to come down, but as<lb/>
things are, I cannot do so-<lb/>
That must be left for your<lb/>
own determination- Other-<lb/>
wise, you could be made<lb/>
perfectly comfortable and<lb/>
happy- As it is, it makes<lb/>
me very unhappy to know<lb/>
that my sweet wifie is<lb/>
so wretched mentally and<lb/>
physically- If I could leave<lb/>
tomorrow, I would gladly<lb/>
do so, but common sense<lb/>
and my judgment tell me not<lb/>
to do so. <hi>monday morning</hi>. 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.<lb/>
Boo! Boo! sweetheart, Dr Ames<lb/>
has just reported that our<lb/>
fourth case is doing splendidly-<lb/>
temperature has fallen to 99&deg;3/5-<lb/>
Isn't that just glorious? Four<lb/>
cases and no deaths, but<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02245009"/>
my <add><hi>sweet</hi></add> wifie said that they would<lb/>
<hi>all die</hi> and that the country would<lb/>
<hi>turn against me</hi> and that I<lb/>
would be everlastingly<lb/>
<hi>disgraced</hi>! He! He! Miss<lb/>
Gouty, you will change<lb/>
your mind when you are<lb/>
&ldquo;Mrs. Surgeon General&rdquo; and<lb/>
holding big receptions on<lb/>
K St.! &ldquo;Go long,&rdquo; you pre-<lb/>
cious Farmer- lady and stop<lb/>
trying to make your old Mr<lb/>
Mantee come home! You<lb/>
know that you don't want<lb/>
to see him one little bit!<lb/>
You just want somebody<lb/>
to <hi>rub that fat toe</hi>!<lb/>
By the time he does get back,<lb/>
you will have recovered<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02245010"/>
from the attack of gout<lb/>
and be &ldquo;fatter &amp; prettier&rdquo; than<lb/>
ever, as Dr Nash would<lb/>
say- I am going in to see<lb/>
Gen. Wood, this morning,<lb/>
with Major Kean, in order<lb/>
to tell him concerning<lb/>
our success- Somehow<lb/>
or other, I feel very happy,<lb/>
this morning, and wish that<lb/>
I had my two pretty girls<lb/>
here just to give them<lb/>
a Kiss &amp; a hug! Don't for-<lb/>
get to get <add>for</add> each other those<lb/>
pretty Christmas presents.<lb/>
Don't worry over presents<lb/>
for others- Goodbye, you pret-<lb/>
ty pictures- Kisses &amp; love &amp; love<lb/>
&amp; Kisses for my precious <hi>babies</hi>!!</p>
