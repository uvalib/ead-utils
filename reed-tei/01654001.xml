<salute>My dear little &ldquo;B.&rdquo;;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Since you were<lb/>
so very prompt(?) in answering<lb/>
my last letter, I cannot<lb/>
find it in my heart to wait<lb/>
till tomorrow to reply- Monday<lb/>
went by and no letter from<lb/>
you- Tuesday came, &amp; still not<lb/>
a word! I had begun to think<lb/>
that perhaps, the widow had<lb/>
frowned on the ancient <unclear>Galen,</unclear><lb/>
and so driven him to bask<lb/>
in your smiles. Or mayhap,<lb/>
the charming Prof. Martin<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01654002"/>
was warbling sweet strains<lb/>
in your attentive ear- Num-<lb/>
erous fancies presented them-<lb/>
selves to my excited imagin-<lb/>
ation- As fast as one was<lb/>
banished, another was ready<lb/>
to take its place, till, at last,<lb/>
my thoughts were heaped in<lb/>
dire confusion- It would be<lb/>
useless, besides affording you<lb/>
too much pleasure in the nar-<lb/>
ration, to tell you <add>of</add> the number<lb/>
of visions I had, all of which<lb/>
resulted in your being borne<lb/>
away by some more fortun-<lb/>
ate suitor, while I was left<lb/>
alone &amp; friendless to weep over<lb/>
my unhappy fate. To speak of<lb/>
these more fully I forbear,<lb/>
since an excess of joy might<lb/>
do hurt to your well-balanced<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01654003"/>
faculties. Moreover the rehear-<lb/>
sal of my repeated defeats<lb/>
could but add to my chagrin.<lb/>
These, and other potent reasons,<lb/>
which I might adduce, prevail<lb/>
upon me to remain silent.<lb/>
At last, when my cup of grief<lb/>
was overflowing, &amp; my store<lb/>
of patience exhausted to its<lb/>
lowest ebb; and whilst I<lb/>
was sitting before a win-<lb/>
dow, with woeful countenance,<lb/>
viewing my deserted scalp,<lb/>
from which the <hi>last</hi> hair had<lb/>
just disappeared, (its prede-<lb/>
cessors having been plucked<lb/>
out <del>the</del> by press of much des-<lb/>
pair), there came a &ldquo;gentle<lb/>
rapping on my door&rdquo;, &amp; upon<lb/>
looking up, I beheld a letter,<lb/>
which the bearer said I<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01654004"/>
was entitled to, by right of super-<lb/>
scription- My first thought was<lb/>
that he had been sent by some<lb/>
Evil Power to taunt me in my<lb/>
distress, &amp; I was about ex-<lb/>
ecuting a thought which was<lb/>
uppermost in my mind; viz:<lb/>
throwing an old shoe at his<lb/>
head; when I was attracted<lb/>
by a certain air of inoffen-<lb/>
siveness which his counten-<lb/>
ance bore, and bidding him<lb/>
<del>to</del> approach, upon closer in-<lb/>
spection, found that the<lb/>
letter was truly mine, and<lb/>
from no other person than<lb/>
yourself- Although it came too<lb/>
late to prevent the deprida-<lb/>
tions which I had committed<lb/>
on my scalp, yet it served to<lb/>
revive my drooping spirits &amp; has<lb/>
given me strength <del>enough</del> to write the foregoing-<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01654005"/>
And now, my precious lit-<lb/>
tle, sweet-heart, promising<lb/>
that the foregoing narrative<lb/>
is to be allowed a certain<lb/>
&ldquo;margin,&rdquo; I will proceed to say,<lb/>
that through some accident,<lb/>
to the deponent unknown, your<lb/>
letter did not reach me till, to-day,<lb/>
but as it was written on Fri-<lb/>
day, I will not seek to complain.<lb/>
It is enough to know that I<lb/>
have a message from your<lb/>
darling self, without the<lb/>
necessity for any mur-<lb/>
muring. You seem to have<lb/>
had a very interesting<lb/>
time recently, in your na-<lb/>
tive city; such as atten-<lb/>
ding marriage-ceremonies,<lb/>
receptions, etc. I am al-<lb/>
most afraid to venture down<lb/>
that way, lest I may not<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01654006"/>
come away alone. Permit me,<lb/>
right here &amp; without farther<lb/>
delay, to apologize for the<lb/>
foregoing sentence, since I<lb/>
am convinced, that on reading<lb/>
it, so greatly would you be<lb/>
offended, that you would refuse<lb/>
to shake hands, <del>should</del> when, I<lb/>
next come. Trusting that you<lb/>
are somewhat paci<del>e</del>fied, al-<lb/>
low me to ask, why you<lb/>
neglected to speak of Dr<lb/>
Lewter's wedding, which oc-<lb/>
curred on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.? I should<lb/>
have imagined that no such<lb/>
important event had ever<lb/>
transpired in the annals<lb/>
of Murfreesboro, and that<lb/>
<del>y</del> it would have deserved,<lb/>
at least, a passing notice<lb/>
from your pen. Was it<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01654007"/>
that your feelings -- well,<lb/>
really, my darling E., pardon<lb/>
this &ldquo;lapsus pennae,&rdquo; as I<lb/>
have foregone the &ldquo;style<lb/>
ironical,&rdquo; although it will<lb/>
occasionally tingle on the<lb/>
point of one's pen.</p>
<p>How long does Miss Bettie<lb/>
Reed intend staying in Mur-<lb/>
freesboro? I should like to<lb/>
tease her a little, if she would<lb/>
bear it. Now that the school-<lb/>
girls are returning, your<lb/>
town will again assume<lb/>
its usual appearance of<lb/>
activity, &amp; many a heart<lb/>
will &ldquo;beat happily.&rdquo; For instance,<lb/>
with what a bright eye and<lb/>
winsome smile will Miss<lb/>
Laura S. greet the return<lb/>
of the wandering Conrad!<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01654008"/>
Ah! &ldquo;there are some happy mo-<lb/>
ments in this lone and des-<lb/>
olate world of ours, that well<lb/>
repay the toil of struggling<lb/>
through it, and atone for many<lb/>
a long, sad night &amp; weary day&rdquo;!<lb/>
'Tis thus I hear her exclaim!<lb/>
And who knows but what some<lb/>
maiden will cease her sighings<lb/>
when she beholds the calm<lb/>
look &amp; commanding figure of<lb/>
my esteemed friend, Sharp!<lb/>
Come, cease your blushing; stran-<lb/>
ger things have happened!<lb/>
Ah! fortunate mortal! To have<lb/>
won so fair a damsel, &amp;<lb/>
with so little show to the public,<lb/>
is a feather in any man's cap!<lb/>
But I must cease.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe <add>me,</add> my darling Emilie,<lb/>
more than ever, your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>-
