<salute>Dear doctor Hench:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am returning your sketch which I found correct<lb/>
excepting that Quemados was a little out of place and al-<lb/>
so the part of Marianao at the end of the line was known<lb/>
as Sam&aacute;.</p>
<p>I have checked up with our friend John J. Moran<lb/>
as to the true location of &ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo; which he places<lb/>
on the &ldquo;San Jos&eacute;&rdquo; estate which fronts on the Calzada Real<lb/>
de Marianao between Marianao and Ceiba at a point now<lb/>
known as &ldquo;Pogolotti&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. Moran certainly has reason to know where<lb/>
&ldquo;Camp Lazear&rdquo; was located and I do not believe it possi-<lb/>
ble that he be mistaken.</p>
<p>I am returning you another copy of the plan of<lb/>
Marianao dated 1906 which was copied of an older plan on<lb/>
which I have marked the &ldquo;San Jos&eacute;&rdquo; estate.</p>
<p>Mr. Moran informs me that there was at the Camp<lb/>
Columbia Barracks Hospital some huts where Yellow Fever<lb/>
patients were taken for treatment and it is very evident<lb/>
that it was one of these huts that was shown to me in<lb/>
1906 as where the experiments were made and which were<lb/>
located to the southwest of the Hospital.</p>
<p>This is apparently where they have marked as the<lb/>
location of the &ldquo;False Camp Lazear&rdquo;.-</p>
<p>The only thing that <del>it</del> is not in accord with my<lb/>
memory is that you say that on this location was erected<lb/>
a small temporary tent hospital while I distintly remem-<lb/>
ber at least two unpainted small wooden one room huts<lb/>
not unlike some of those shown on your photograph of the<lb/>
model, which you sent me.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03805009"/>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>There is no record of there ever having been a bridge<lb/>
over our track at any point in Marianao nor between Quemados<lb/>
and La Playa.-</p>
<p>Practically all of our track in the vicinity of the<lb/>
Military Hospital is through cuttings or on fills and I am<lb/>
led to believe that the model referred to was made up as a<lb/>
project and not showing what was actually constructed as<lb/>
it would appear our tracks are on very flat ground which<lb/>
cannot be at that point.</p>
<p>In short I do not believe that the bridge ever existed.</p>
<p>Should I obtain any further information I will be<lb/>
pleased to forward it to you and in the meanwhile should you<lb/>
desire any specific information that I can obtain for you I<lb/>
would be pleased to carry out your requests.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>R S Webster</signed>
<seg>
P.S. I am also enclosing plan of Marianao as of 1924<lb/>
showing the San Jos&eacute; estate and Camp Columbia.<lb/>
