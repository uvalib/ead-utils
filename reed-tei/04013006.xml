<title>Letter from Adrian Macia to Philip Showalter Hench, March 9, 1942</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Macia returns a check for the purchase of a small lot of land at the former site of Camp Lazear. He is concerned that this lot might interfere with his quarry or with the entrance to the land in the back of it. He is willing to reconsider until definite plans have been made for the memorialization of the site. Macia informs Hench that some small repairs have been done at Building No. 1.</p>

Doctor P.S. Hench, M.D.,<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I want to acknowledge receipt of yours dated January<lb/>
30th. enclosing a check to my order for the amount of $150. Your check<lb/>
I am returning to you now as I could not accept it for the purchase of<lb/>
land as you intended. In my last letter I told you that in case you went<lb/>
ahead with your projects we would probably present that small lot of land<lb/>
and for this reason I cannot accept the check you sent.</p>
<p>Regarding the lot of land you have outlined in the map I am sorry to<lb/>
say I dont think I could very well give you a price for it as I will not<lb/>
be willing to sell unless some definite projects were on the way of<lb/>
realization, and then you can be sure that the price we will set for this<lb/>
lot would be a very reasonable one not trying to take any advantage, but<lb/>
we will have to consider whether this lot would interfere with our quarry<lb/>
or with the entrance to the land back of it.</p>
<p>So I think that more definite studies have to be made before I could<lb/>
give you a proper answer.</p>
<p>Regarding what you ask me about Dr. Ponce, I do not know him, but I<lb/>
can inform you that something has been published some time ago in the<lb/>
local press and also by radio; but I know that Dr. Marruz at the time<lb/>
Minister of Health visited the site of camp Lazear, but nothing else has<lb/>
been published or said as far as I know, and Dr. Marruz is now no longer<lb/>
Minister of Health. I will be very pleased to inform you of any further<lb/>
developments along this line.</p>
<p>Since my last letter I have learned that some small repair was done<lb/>
to the little house, I suppose by Mr. Moran so I am sorry about my<lb/>
information in my last letter that nothing had been done.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely,</salute>
