<p>DR. JESSE W. LAZEAR<lb/>
DIES IN HAVANA.</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>Baltimore Physician Victim of Yel-<lb/>
low Fever While Making a<lb/>
Study of Its Germ.</p>
<p>Dr. Jesse W. Lazear, one of the best-known<lb/>
experts on bacteria and yellow fever germs,<lb/>
died on Tuesday evening at half-past eight<lb/>
o'clock at Havana, Cuba. Dr. Lazear had<lb/>
gone to Cuba for the United States govern-<lb/>
ment to study and report upon yellow fever<lb/>
germs, and by a strange turn of fate the<lb/>
fever was the cause of his death. He was a<lb/>
native of Baltimore, and had lived for some<lb/>
time with his family here.</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear was born in the suburbs of<lb/>
Baltimore in 1866, and was a son of William<lb/>
L. Lazear and Charlotte Peddigrew. His<lb/>
grandfather was General Jesse Lazear, for<lb/>
several years the cashier of the bank at<lb/>
Waynesboro, Pa., and who also represented<lb/>
that district in Congress as a Democrat<lb/>
from 1864 to 1868. At the close of his sec-<lb/>
ond term he purchased an estate in the<lb/>
suburbs of Baltimore, called Windsor, and<lb/>
he died there in 1877.</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear attended college in Washing-<lb/>
ton, Pa., and after graduating there at-<lb/>
tended the Hopkins University. He grad-<lb/>
uated in the class of 1889, after which he<lb/>
went to New York and entered the College of<lb/>
Physicians and Surgeons there. He gradu-<lb/>
ated in 1892 at the head of his class, and re-<lb/>
ceived an appointment to the Bellevue Hos-<lb/>
pital in New York, where he served for two<lb/>
years. After leaving the hospital he went to<lb/>
Berlin for the further study of bacteria.</p>
<p>In 1895 he was asked to take a position in<lb/>
the Johns Hopkins Hospital, with special<lb/>
reference to the study of germs, which he<lb/>
accepted. In the same year he married<lb/>
Miss Mabel Houston, of California, whom he<lb/>
had met when abroad. He made his home<lb/>
for some time on Park avenue with his fam-<lb/>
ily. About a year ago Surgeon General<lb/>
Sternberg, of the United States Army, in-<lb/>
vited him to take a position on his staff for<lb/>
work in Cuba for the special study of yellow<lb/>
fever germs. His family was with him in<lb/>
Cuba until May last, when they came back<lb/>
to this country to spend the summer in the<lb/>
North, being now in Massachusetts. The<lb/>
deceased is survived by his mother, his wife<lb/>
and two children--a boy of two years and a<lb/>
girl of two months. Dr. Lazear was a mem-<lb/>
ber of the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity of the<lb/>
Hopkins.</p>
<p>His remains cannot be brought <unclear></unclear><lb/>
country for the present on <unclear></unclear><lb/>
health laws. <unclear>After</unclear><lb/>
elapsed <unclear>they</unclear><lb/>
