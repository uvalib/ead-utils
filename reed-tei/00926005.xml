<salute>Dear Doctor Barber:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am herewith returning Kudo's article, which really seems to me<lb/>
to be good, and your so-wonderful picture of the ladies useful in<lb/>
military transportation. Do you know, I think Roubaud might have used<lb/>
them as &ldquo;protective animals&rdquo; as well as stock!</p>
<p>Joking aside, if you will look on Pages 178 and '79 you will see<lb/>
that Kudo gives a fair basis for the somewhat lurid account in the<lb/>
Times. Well, natural enemies be multiplied!--and this parasite<lb/>
may be an adjuvant. It would act in grassy and algae-covered places<lb/>
where fish would not.</p>
<p>I judge my Abstracts on Roubaud's and LeGendre's articles are<lb/>
out. The one published in /20 can scarcely be held to be recent lit-<lb/>
erature, but I felt quite certain the men in the field had not seen<lb/>
it and added the one of 1918 as containing his claim that these Ano-<lb/>
pheles were readily infectable and infective.</p>
<p>I have not seen the one you alluded to--Bul. Soc. Path. Exot.<lb/>
XIV: 1921, 577--as the last one in the Surgeon General's Library goes<lb/>
only to Page 451 and they haven't it at the Congressional Library.<lb/>
Netiher have I been able to see the original of<lb/>
in the Memoires of the Danish Royal Academy as that Journal had not<lb/>
been received at any of the four places I have tried: Agriculture:<lb/>
Carnegie and the other two.</p>
<p>I would like well to go down to Camilla and work with you for<lb/>
a month or so.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00926006"/>

<p>I profoundly disbelieve that the winter attack on Anopheles is<lb/>
worth much where the breeding season is so long as we have it; for things<lb/>
that breed as rapidly as they do the number that commences the season<lb/>
simply affects the date at which the maximum density occurs--scarcely<lb/>
the maximum density itself. The limit to the density of Anopheles a-<lb/>
round Camilla would be given by something else than the number of fe-<lb/>
males available for oviposition--probably available area of breeding<lb/>
places. It is doubtless worth while where the breeding season is short.</p>
<p>Possibly hand catching or &ldquo;swatting&rdquo; of those found in dwelling<lb/>
houses in the early spring (hibernated females) might prevent a certain<lb/>
amount of the early spring malaria, thus leaving fewer carriers to in-<lb/>
fect the first flight of Anopheles.</p>
<p>It is possible that the parasite may survive the winter in the in-<lb/>
sect host as far south as Camilla, but I was thinking rather of the un-<lb/>
infected hibernated females, early infected and spreading infection be-<lb/>
fore they die.</p>
<p>Give my love to Theodore Hayne, who I thought was studying at<lb/>
Charleston.</p>
<p>By the way, I had a copy of your article on the use of Paris green<lb/>
sent to everyone engaged or interested in malaria work on the mailing<lb/>
list of the Bureau. It was given to me to abstract, but I thought the<lb/>
article itself would do far better than any abstract of it.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
