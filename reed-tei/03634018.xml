P. S. Hench, M.D.,<lb/>

Minn.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Philip,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wish that I could impersonate and repre-<lb/>
sent your father at Washington, Pa. this week end at the<lb/>
various functions in connection with the Founders' Day Ex-<lb/>
ercises. That of course I can not do. Nevertheless I can not<lb/>
but feel the satisfaction and joy which he would have had<lb/>
were he alive today.</p>
<p>I regret that I can not be present in my own<lb/>
person; the most that I can do is to try to picture the small<lb/>
boy with whom I used to play bear on the floor, now not only<lb/>
grown to the full stature of manhood but seated well up among<lb/>
the leaders of his own profession, medicine. I am happy at<lb/>
your success and wish for you still further distinction.</p>
<p>Next to my own boys, I believe that I have a<lb/>
deeper and longer continued interest in Atcheson and yourself<lb/>
than in any of the many boys I have known. In fact most of them<lb/>
have faded completely from my memory. I suspect too that I abide<lb/>
in the memory of a very few of them.</p>
<p>Just one year ago while on our way to visit Dr.<lb/>
Sharpe in Blairstown, New Jersey, we passed through Easton and<lb/>
both of us spoke of the many times we had heard your father<lb/>
speak of Lafayette College and of his intense loyalty to it.<lb/>
In fact if he supported an institution or possessed a friend<lb/>
he seldom withdrew his support and would not be <unclear>disposessed</unclear>.<lb/>
To me his Christian fortitude was wonderful.</p>
<p>There was some snow in this area yesterday; I<lb/>
suppose winter will be upon us soon; I'm hoping that we'll have<lb/>
a prolonged Indian summer continuing even to the old time Thanks-<lb/>
giving. Which brings me to say that the politicians seem to be<lb/>
warming up to their jobs. Where in the world is there such diver-<lb/>
sity of opinion and yet such harmony after the fight is over.</p>
<p>We were in Pgh early in Sept. At that time<lb/>
your mother seemed quite well. She maintains a lively interest in<lb/>
political and church affairs. We were told today that Dr. Evans,<lb/>
pastor of the Third church had had a call to Mark Matthews Church<lb/>
in Seattle. Maybe he will not accept even though it would be a<lb/>
big advancement in many ways.</p>
<p>You may not care to read all this. Even so I<lb/>
can but remember how excited you used to become at my antics. Your<lb/>
mother says &ldquo;Uncle Billy&rdquo; and so I like you to think.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
