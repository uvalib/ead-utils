<p>EXPERIENCES OF MR. JOHN R. BULLARD IN HAVANA, 1901<lb/>
IN CONNECTION WITH THE U.S. ARMY YELLOW FEVER BOARD AND EXPERIMENTAL YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
(As told by Mr. Bullard to Dr. P. S. Hench in St. Augustine, April 16, 1941.<lb/>
To be corrected and amplified by Mr. Bullard, July, 1941.)</p>
<p><hi>Foreword:</hi> "Mr. John R. Bullard, native of Massachusetts, a graduate<lb/>
of Harvard University where he was a distinguished athlete, and <add>later on</add> engaged in farming<lb/>
in Cuba, volunteered and was infected with yellow fever by the injection of blood.<lb/>
He became sick October 23, 1901 "(From Senate Doc. 822, p. 28). For the official<lb/>
record of Mr. Bullard's case see article &ldquo;The Etiology of Yellow Fever--A Supple-<lb/>
mental Note&rdquo; by Reed and Carroll originally published in American Medicine, <hi>3</hi>:<lb/>
301-305; Feb. 22, 1902; also published in Senate Doc. 822, Chapt. 7, p. 156 (case<lb/>
IX--J.R.B.) and pp. 158-159 (Case X--erroneously labelled case of J.M.B. instead<lb/>
of J.R.B.). On October 15, 1901, Bullard was given a subcutaneous injection of<lb/>
infected serum filtrate. A transient febrile reaction occurred on October 19<lb/>
but no yellow fever developed. On October 22, 1901, he was given a subcutaneous<lb/>
injection of infected blood and on October 23 developed experimental yellow fever.</p>
<p>Mr. Bullard never met Walter Reed; the latter had left Cuba <del>in</del><add>on</add> February 9,<lb/>
<del>or March,</del> 1901. Carroll returned to Havana October, 1901 to do some supplementary<lb/>
experiments. Since Carroll was still acting as a member of the U. S. Army Yellow<lb/>
Fever Board the work done by Carroll (including the experiments on Bullard) was<lb/>
reported with Reed as coming from the board. (Comment of P.S.H.--Why wasn't<lb/>
Agramonte's name listed as co-author?) Hence Bullard's case was officially among<lb/>
those studied by the board and he was therefore eligible for the honors (medal<lb/>
and annuity) later voted by Congress. However, since his case belongs to Carroll's<lb/>
late series (October, 1901) Bullard's name (and that of the others of Carroll's<lb/>
October, 1901 series) is often not listed by writers who only consider the cases<lb/>
of the fall of 1900 and the spring of 1901. P.S.H.</p>

<p>Hench--2--ds</p>
<p><hi>Mr. Bullard's own story</hi> (to be corrected and amplified by him).</p>
<p>I was born at Dedham, Massachusetts, July 5, 1872. In <add>September</add> 189<del>4</del><add>2</add> <del>when</del> I entered<lb/>
<del>went to</del> Harvard; My <del>family lived</del><add>school and social life had been</add> in Boston. I was a member of the Harvard crews<lb/>
of 1894, 1895 and 1896, being captain in 1895 and 1896. (The only other Harvard<lb/>
crewman who ever became captain for two years was my younger brother, Harold, name?<lb/>
who was captain in 1901 and 1902.) I graduated from Harvard <del>academic (<unclear>2</unclear>) course</del><add>with an A. B. degree</add><lb/>
in <add>June</add> 1896 and that fall <add>decided not to continue at the Law School in spite of my father's<lb/>
wishes,<lb/>
who was a<lb/>
Boston lawyer.</add><del>entered Harvard Law School but did not enjoy my studies</del><lb/>
<del>and <unclear>1894</unclear> law school after two months.</del> I met a man in Boston who <del>offered me a</del><add>owned</add><lb/>
<del>job in Mexico on</del> a coffee plantation <add>in Mexico and invited me to visit him.</add> I <del>worked</del><add>was</add> there from January to June 1897</p>
<p>But after <del>6</del><add>5</add> months in Mexico <del>I tired of the life and work</del><add>the prospects had no appeal</add> and I<lb/>
took a steamer for <del>Boston</del><add>New York</add> via Havana. Enroute to Havana I became very ill and<lb/>
when my boat entered the harbor of Havana the physician of the port who was none<lb/>
other than &ldquo;dear old Dr. Carlos Finlay&rdquo; (this was in <add>June</add> 1897) wanted me to disembark<lb/>
and enter a hospital in Havana. But <del>I was so anxious to get home that</del><add>as Habana was a pest-hole at that time</add> I refused<lb/>
and stayed aboard only after assuming full responsibility in case I should die<lb/>
enroute to <del>Boston</del><add>New York</add>. Thereafter I was sick most of the time for three years of what<lb/>
was found in 1899 to be amebic dysentery. During these three years (1897-<del>1899</del><add>1900</add>)<lb/>
I lived part time in <del>Boston</del><add>Dedham</add>, part time in Bermuda where I <del>was</del><add>had under lease</add> a <del>farm of</del><add>small</add> potato<del><unclear>es</unclear></del><lb/>
and lil<del><unclear>ies</unclear>.</del><add>y farm.</add> I was cured <add>completely</add> <del>on</del><add>by</add> the spring of <del>1899</del><add>1901</add>. <del>About that time</del><add>In 1900</add> my father<del><unclear>, a</unclear><lb/>
Boston lawyer,</del> died.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1901 I felt I couldn't stand Boston any<del>more</del><add>longer</add> as I was<lb/>
fed up <del>with my life there</del><add>with many things</add> and distracted by <add>a</add> personal grief, so I decided to go<lb/>
to Cuba, buy a farm and settle down permanently there. I landed in <del>Cuba</del><add>Habana in</add> September<lb/>
<del><unclear>by</unclear></del> 1901, a few days after the assassination of President McKinley. <del>On</del><add>After</add> arriv<del>ing</del><add>al</add> <del><unclear>in<lb/>
Havana</unclear></del> I <del>went to visit</del><add>called on</add> Major Jefferson R. Kean <del>who with</del><add>and</add> Mrs. Kean <del>was</del><add>who were</add> living <unclear>dth</unclear><lb/>
their two children in the &ldquo;officers row&rdquo; of houses at Columbia Barracks, Quemados,<lb/>
Cuba, <add>a few miles west of Habana.</add> I had <add>previously</add> known the Major and his wife (the first Mrs. Kean) who had been Louise<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03809020"/>
Hench--3--ds<lb/>
Young, the daughter of my mother's first cousin. Major Kean had met Miss Young<lb/>
at St. Augustine, <add>Florida.</add> Major and Mrs. Kean invited me <add>to visit them</add> <del>to live at their home until I</del><add>whenever</add><lb/>
<del>should start out to hunt for a farm to purchase.</del><add>I cared to.</add> After a very few days I set out<lb/>
and while hunting for a farm in <hi>Artemisa</hi> in the province of Pinar del Rio, I de-<lb/>
veloped malaria <del>about September 10, 1901</del> <add>and</add> <del><unclear>by</unclear></del> <add>at once</add> returned to the home of Major Kean<lb/>
<del>while I was ill of malaria.</del> Dr. (Major) Kean had Dr. Carroll see me and it was de-<lb/>
cided that I had probably gotten my malaria by exposure while <del><unclear>on</unclear></del><add>at</add> a house party <del>in</del><add>on</add><lb/>
Cape Cod just prior to leaving for Havana. (Comment--Isn't that a long incubation<lb/>
period?) (Search me!)</p>
<p>spelling<lb/>
ok?<lb/>
yes.</p>
<p>While convalescing from my malaria at Major Kean's home I frequently was<lb/>
present when Kean and Carroll, the latter a constant visitor at the Kean house,<lb/>
discussed Carroll's yellow fever experiments. In the evenings Carroll often stopped<lb/>
in to discuss his cases of experimental yellow fever. Having become somewhat fam-<lb/>
iliar with Dr. Carroll's work I decided to get an immunizing dose of yellow fever<lb/>
from Dr. Carroll so that I could stay in Cuba without further interruption of my<lb/>
career. <del>I had already changed occupations and habitations several times and was<lb/>
determined to make a real go of it this time in Cuba.</del> Volunteering to Dr. Carroll<lb/>
for experimental yellow fever was, I can assure you, a cold blooded business proposi-<lb/>
tion. There were no heroics in it as far as I was concerned. Although the recent<lb/>
experiments of Reed, Carroll and their associates had strongly incriminated the<lb/>
mosquito as the cause of yellow fever nobody yet knew at that time (October, 1901)<lb/>
that yellow fever would really be eradicated from Cuba; I suspected that I would<lb/>
probably get it spontaneously anyhow, so I decided I'd rather have it under <add>the most</add> favorable<lb/>
circumstances <del>via</del><add>and</add> Carroll's <add>expert care; country doctors were still killing many by diagnosing<lb/>
yellow fever as malaria and<lb/>
giving large doses of <unclear>guinine</unclear>.</add><del><unclear>immunizing dose</unclear>.</del></p>
<p>But I had a hard time persuading Dr. Carroll to use me. After he <add>had put</add> <del>turned</del><lb/>
me <del>down</del><add>off</add> several times, <del>(Mr. Bullard, please amplify)</del> one evening Dr. Carroll turned<lb/>
to Major Kean and said, &ldquo;What do you suppose this young <del><unclear></unclear></del><add>man</add> wants? He wants us to<lb/>
use him as an experimental case so that he may became<lb/>
immune to yellow fever and not have to worry about it any<lb/>
further out in the country.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f03809021"/>
<p>Why did Major Kean think it foolish? He knew the<lb/>
importance of the experiments. Perhaps he thought enough had been<lb/>
done?</p>
<p>Hench--4--ds</p>
<p>(He said there was always a chance that it wouldn't come out right.</p>
<p><del>experiment on him so he'll have an immunizing dose of yellow fever."</del> Thereupon<lb/>
Major Kean <del>&ldquo;gave me hell&rdquo; telling me</del><add>tried to dissuade me, saying</add> he thought I was <add>very</add> foolish (Mr. Bullard, why?<lb/>
please amplify). But Dr. Carroll finally agreed to take me on. So on October 15,<lb/>
1901 I went to the &ldquo;General <del>Ward</del><add>Wood</add> Laboratory&rdquo; on Calzada de la <del>Roma</del><add>Reina</add> in Havana.<lb/>
This was a government laboratory where Carroll was raising his mosquitoes at that<lb/>
time. There I met two army privates, Paul Hamann and Albert W. Covington who had<lb/>
also volunteered for Dr. Carroll's experiments and <del>We three men sat <hi>in a row</hi> while</del><lb/>
Dr. Carroll injected us with infected serum under our shoulder blades.</p>
<p>What<lb/>
was this<lb/>
<unclear>lab?</unclear><lb/>
Amplify?<lb/>
I know nothing<lb/>
more about<lb/>
this Gen. Wood<lb/>
Lab.</p>
<p>You had better<lb/>
check location<lb/>
of Lab. as<lb/>
name of ave. was changed<lb/>
several<lb/>
times.</p>
<p>(Mr. Bullard, please note a discrepancy here between your story and the<lb/>
official record. You infer that all three of you received your injections at the<lb/>
same time, i.e. almost simultaneously the same hour. But the record (Senate Doc.<lb/>
822, p. 156,) says Hamann was injected 11 A.M. October 15, Covington at 11:05 A.M.<lb/>
October 15 and yourself at 2:30 <hi>P.M.</hi> that day. Perhaps the three of you sat to-<lb/>
gether in an outer office; they were injected in the morning but for some reason<lb/>
your injection was postponed till after lunch. How about this?)</p>
<p>I do not understand<lb/>
this at all; better use<lb/>
my amendment which is harmless.<lb/>
Carroll, Hamann</p>
<p>After receiving their injections Hamann and Covington returned to their<lb/>
No, what was known as the Santa Clara <unclear>Battery</unclear> in El Vedado.<lb/>
stations (I <hi>suppose you mean</hi> at Camp Columbia). After receiving my injection I<lb/>
<del>went at once (<hi>how? By yourself</hi>, by train or in an ambulance?)</del><add>was taken in an army passenger waggon drawn by mules</add> out to one of the<lb/>
yellow fever wards at Columbia Barracks. I was quarantined in one of the little<lb/>
buildings which made up these wards. My recollection is that in October, 1901<lb/>
these yellow fever wards consisted of about six small shacks; some hold only two<lb/>
beds, others held several beds. Each shack had a complicated double entrance,<lb/>
double doors protected by permanent mosquito netting. These shacks were beside<lb/>
the La Playa Railroad track. When I was there I do not <del>believe there were</del><add>remember</add> any tents<lb/>
used for yellow fever cases. I remained in one of these little buildings (two beds<lb/>
<del>or more?</del>) night and day. <add>An army contract surgeon, Mazzuri from New Orleans was - charge of the camp.</add> Dr. Carroll came to see <del><unclear></unclear> twice a day</del><add>us daily</add>, and Major Kean<lb/>
<del>often</del> called. <del>About</del><add>On</add> the <del>third</del><add>fourth</add> day of my quarantine <del>(<unclear></unclear> about October 18) [the<lb/>
records say it was October 19]</del> I heard an ambulance pull up outside. <add>Without permission</add> I went out<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f03809022"/>
Hench--5--ds<lb/>
to see if I could help <del>the orderly</del><add>with the litters</add> and there I found that the occupants of the<lb/>
ambulance were none other than my two fellow volunteers, Hamann and Covington,<lb/>
who had come down with yellow fever! This gave me quite &ldquo;a kick&rdquo;. I admit I felt<lb/>
rather excited, and promptly developed a rapid pulse and a <del>mild fever</del><add>rise in temperature</add>. But these<lb/>
<hi>soon</hi> passed off. Obviously I didn't have yellow fever although I don't know yet<lb/>
why they got it and I did not.</p>
<p>If you were <unclear>quarantined</unclear> how was it you were allowed<lb/>
outside, &amp; later helped around <unclear>the wards</unclear>? What was the<lb/>
extent of your quarantine? Observation and confinement to the Yellow Fever Camp.</p>
<p>and Covington are dead. I<lb/>
have for support citation in<lb/>
Army Register which says &ldquo;<hi>at<lb/>
the same time</hi>.&rdquo; It does not<lb/>
say: on the same day.</p>
<p><hi>stick to<lb/>
the records</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;Etiology of Yellow Fever- Supplemental Note by Reed &amp; <unclear>Coreds</unclear><lb/>
Case TX J R B Injection given 2.30 P.M Oct 15, &amp; at<lb/>
3 PM Oct 19, headache, flashes of heat, slight pain between shoulders<lb/>
Temperature 99.4&deg; pulse 92. At 9 PM temp. 98.4&deg; pulse 84, and<lb/>
following day in usual good health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>how<lb/>
soon?</p>
<p>The next few days I remained under quarantine and kept myself occupied<lb/>
by helping the orderlies at the yellow fever shacks. Major Kean <add>tried to make me believe that</add> <del>decided</del> I must be<lb/>
a natural immune and <del>advised</del><add>wanted</add> me to return to his house but I said, &ldquo;Hell, no!<lb/>
I'm only half way through this.&rdquo; So I persuaded Dr. Carroll to give me an in-<lb/>
jection of blood <add>to test my supposed immunity, which he drew</add> from Hamann. (Covington's blood test was such that Dr. Carroll<lb/>
wouldn't give me any of Covington's blood.) I had this injection on October 22.<lb/>
Next day I came down with yellow fever. I had a &ldquo;mild case&rdquo; and wasn't officially<lb/>
very sick but it was bad enough. I had headaches, pains and tenderness in my<lb/>
abdomen, mild jaundice and albuminuria. I was cared for in the same &ldquo;yellow fever<lb/>
ward&rdquo;, one of the several small wooden buildings I have mentioned as being beside<lb/>
the La Playa railroad track. I recall the little old bridge across this track<lb/>
for I crossed it (<hi>when, Mr. Bullard</hi>?). after discharge and I <unclear>passed</unclear> under it many times<lb/>
when going from Quemados to the Playa or <unclear>r.r.</unclear> train.</p>
<p>Amplify?</p>
<p>On the third day of my illness the <del>Havana</del> Yellow Fever Board came out from Habana<lb/>
to see <del>me.</del><add>us.</add> It included Dr<del>s</del>. <del>Agramonte and</del> Finlay. I remember Dr. Finlay <del><unclear>best</unclear></del> <add>especially</add><lb/>
because of the following incident. When Dr. Finlay came into the room and saw me<lb/>
he promptly said, &ldquo;I have seen you before&rdquo; and then <del>Finlay</del><add>he</add> recalled that <del>he</del><add>I</add><lb/>
<del>(Bullard)</del> was the young fellow whom he had seen four years before sick on a boat<lb/>
in Havana harbor; he did not remember my name.</p>
<p>or do you<lb/>
mean<lb/>
Albertini?<lb/>
I am not<lb/>
sure which<lb/>
so cut him<lb/>
as immaterial.</p>
<p>After the acute phase of my illness I returned to Major Kean's house<lb/>
to recuperate for a few days and then returned to <hi>Artem<del>e</del><add>i</add>sa</hi> <del>in my search for a<lb/>
farm. There I</del><add>and</add> bought a farm and <del>raised</del><add>planted</add> tobacco for three and a half years. Then<lb/>
in 1905 I went into the real estate business with <del>offices</del><add>headquarters</add> in Havana till 1909<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f03809023"/>
Hench--6--ds<lb/>
when <del>with</del> a <del>partner</del><add>friend and</add> I <del>bought</del><add>acquired</add> a <add>small</add> sugar plantation &ldquo;Central Armonia,&rdquo; <add>at</add> Bolondron in<lb/>
Matanzas Province. In 1911 I entered the employ of The Cuba Company, a large holding<lb/>
<del>sugar</del> company <del>of which</del><add>and</add> <del>I</del> became Vice President in 192<del>4.</del><add>5 of its sugar subsidiary Compa&ntilde;ia <unclear>Cu</unclear>-<lb/>
bana.</add> I left Cuba in 1929 because<lb/>
of ill health and have not returned since. I have retired from business and have<lb/>
lived in St. Augustine since 1933.</p>
<p>spelling</p>
<p>(In 1929-1930 Mr. Bullard was a patient for several months at the Mayo<lb/>
Clinic. He stayed at The Kahler, met Mr. Kahler, my wife's father, and was enter-<lb/>
tained a couple of times in Mr. Kahler's home. Mr. Bullard recalls meeting me in<lb/>
Rochester and recognized me at once when I visited him in St. Augustine on<lb/>
April 16, 1941. - P.S.H.)</p>
<p><hi>Addenda.</hi> Mr. Bullard never saw Camp Lazear nor Military Hospital No. 1.<lb/>
(Why bring this in?)<lb/>
<del>He only visited Las Animas Hospital once (for what reason?).</del> He knew nothing as to<lb/>
whether Moran or Kissinger volunteered first. He had never met Miss Maas. He<lb/>
did not know exactly where Lazear died but <hi>he distinctly remembered that the first<lb/>
Mrs. Kean told him that she and others were convinced that Lazear had been bitten<lb/>
on purpose.</hi> Bullard's case belongs to Carroll's late series (October, 1901) and<lb/>
was not listed in Guiteras' series. Bullard did not know personally any of those<lb/>
who participated in the earlier experiments of Lazear, Reed, Carroll or Agramonte.<lb/>
He stated that the brief data about him in the article &ldquo;Honor the Memory of Heroes...&rdquo;<lb/>
etc. (page 6) was correct. He had a few clippings re three or four volunteers who<lb/>
had died and very kindly gave them to me. He had no other data except the early<lb/>
photographs of himself taken in 189<del>5</del><add>4</add> <del>(?)</del> and in 1901, copies of which he kindly<lb/>
gave me.</p>
