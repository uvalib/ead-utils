FROM GEN. J. R. KEAN<lb/>
LEGACION DE PANAMA<lb/>
PARIS<lb/>
<dateline>
Paris, <date value="1925-04-05">April 5th.1925.-</date>
</dateline>
from <unclear>Dr</unclear> Amador<lb/>
Col. Jefferson R. Kean.<lb/>
Medical Corps U.S. Army. (Ret)<lb/>
Washington.<lb/>
D.C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Colonel Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have read in the &ldquo;Army and Navy Register&rdquo; of<lb/>
March 14th. a very interesting article concerning the &ldquo;Life and Work<lb/>
of General Gorgas&rdquo;. It has been a great pleasure for me to see that<lb/>
you recollect the fact that our distinguished and never forgotten<lb/>
friend, Major Walter Reed, <add>was</add> presented for the Christmas tree, &ldquo;a wonder-<lb/>
ful stegomyia made of champagne cork with formidable prebosis, and tooth<lb/>
pick legs beautifully banded, while Dr. Amador, the Post sanitary officer<lb/>
received a can of kerosene as his badge of office with doggered verses<lb/>
describing the pursuit of the mosquito&rdquo;.-</p>
<p>I have always considered that it was a great honor and a lucky<lb/>
event for me, to have been at Columbia Barracks, under your command and<lb/>
while the late Major Reed was trying to solve the problem of yellow<lb/>
fever. During these past years, I have never failed to call the atten-<lb/>
tion to the fact, that in my humble opinion, Major Reed's work has not<lb/>
been appreciated in its full value, not by the medical world, but by the<lb/>
people. General Gorgas' name is all it is known and there are thousands<lb/>
who don't even know Reed's name.- General Gorgas did a great work but<lb/>
Reed was really &ldquo;the man behind&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I intend to write a pamphlet for the people of my own country,<lb/>
Panama, who more than anybody else, have received the benefits of <unclear>Reed8s</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06269026"/>
-2-<lb/>
FROM GEN. J. R. KEAN<lb/>
work, to show them what part our beloved friend took in the matter.</p>
<p>As I will write for the people, that is, for the public in general,<lb/>
I shall leave aside all technical information; however, it will be use-<lb/>
ful for me to have certain documentation and to know a few facts con-<lb/>
cerning the history of Reed's work.- Of course, I know all the techni-<lb/>
que which was practiced during the experiments etc. and I simply would<lb/>
like to know a few things, in the same order of ideas as the incident<lb/>
of the <unclear>stegomia</unclear> made out of champagne cork and the kerosene can pre-<lb/>
sented to me.-</p>
<p>By the way, do you know the whole story concerning the &ldquo;X.Y.&rdquo;<lb/>
case?.- Do you remember that this man was in the receiving ward at Co-<lb/>
lumbia Barracks, the ward that I had under my charge?.- Do you remember<lb/>
when I made the diagnosis of yellow fever, without knowing that this<lb/>
man, who I remember perfectly well, was suffering from a broken femur?.</p>
<p>Do you remember when I told Major Reed my diagnosis and he called<lb/>
Guiteras, Finlay himself, Lain&eacute; and the rest of the &ldquo;Yellow Fever Board&rdquo;<lb/>
in Havana, who all confirmed my diagnosis?.- If you do, my dear Colonel,<lb/>
I would like you to write to me recalling all these facts.- You are one<lb/>
of the few who are in a position to know all these facts, and it will<lb/>
be a great pleasure for me to to have a confirmation from you. I, like<lb/>
yourself, I am retired from the medical active work, but I always look<lb/>
back at the time when I was at Pinar del Rio, and later at Columbia<lb/>
Barracks under your command.-</p>
<p>I have been told that Prof. Howard Kelly has written something<lb/>
in which he mentions my name. Could you tell me the title of his book?.</p>
<p>Pardon me for taking your time but if I do so is taking advantage<lb/>
of the esteem that I always had for you,-</p>
<p>Believe me, my dear Colonel,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very sincerely</salute>
<signed>R. A. Amador</signed>.
