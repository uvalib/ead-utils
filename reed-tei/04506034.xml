<title>Letter from Philip Showalter Hench to Albert E. Truby, November 6, 1952</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Hench thinks that Camp Lazear will be called &ldquo;Parque Finlay,&rdquo; which he regrets. He is very distressed after seeing photographs which show that Building No. 1 is being repaired extensively rather than enclosed and preserved. He feels the building will be a replica and not a restoration. He mentions the recent death of Cooke.</p>

General Albert E. Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco, California<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been hopping all over the country, so busy. As I wrote you,<lb/>
Doctor Nogueira informed me that your name is to be on one of the bronze<lb/>
tablets now being erected at Camp Lazear. The Camp is to be dedicated on<lb/>
December 3. I have not yet heard of the name it will bear but I suspect<lb/>
&ldquo;Parque Finlay,&rdquo;which I greatly regret. Nogueira writes me that you and<lb/>
others will shortly receive an official invitation.</p>
<p>I have just received a letter from Doctor Nogueira asking if you will send<lb/>
him a photograph. He does not say whether he wants it for publicity con-<lb/>
nected with the dedication or to frame and hang in the little house. I am<lb/>
writing him today asking him about this and will ask him to write you directly<lb/>
but since time passes, I thought you had better get a photograph ready for<lb/>
him. You will remember his address is Dr. Pedro Nogueira, Marti 219,<lb/>
Marianao, Havana, Cuba.</p>
<p>Had you heard that Doctor Cooke died a couple of weeks ago? I do indeed<lb/>
hope that you are feeling better. You have had a very rough time but I was<lb/>
glad to know from your last letter that you seem to be improving now so<lb/>
definitely.</p>
<p>I have been considerably distressed by another thing. Doctor Nogueira and<lb/>
I have frequently talked about trying to preserve, as intact as possible,<lb/>
the original shell of Building No. 1. I had hoped that a new outer shell<lb/>
would be built around the original building. About a month ago, without<lb/>
prior consultation or discussion, he merely wrote me that they were already<lb/>
making extensive repairs to the building, tearing out part of the old wood.<lb/>
I cabled him and wrote him at once expressing the hope that they could pre-<lb/>
serve as much of the original wood as possible and asked him to save for me<lb/>
(to use later for souvenirs) as much of the old wood walls as possible. He<lb/>
assured me that he would, but photographs from him which arrived yesterday<lb/>
show that they removed practically all of the walls which makes me believe<lb/>
that they will end up with a replica rather than a restoration. This<lb/>
distresses me greatly but perhaps it was unavoidable unless they were pre-<lb/>
pared to take special care and do a special job.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
