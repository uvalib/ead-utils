Mr. George A. Kellogg<lb/>
257 Cornelison Avenue<lb/>
Jersey City, N. J.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Kellogg:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was delayed in writing Fishbein because of the press of work.<lb/>
Enclosed is a copy of the letter I am sending him today. I have purposely left<lb/>
certain obvious suggestions to you. I would suggest that you write him speci-<lb/>
fically, assuming that they are going to include my introductory remarks about<lb/>
Cornwell and the painting as a separate note to be included in the news item<lb/>
to go with the colored inserts. I suggest you also assume, from his statement,<lb/>
&ldquo;We would then include that material in a separate item to accompany the re-<lb/>
production of the painting <hi>and the photographs</hi>&rdquo; that he may be using also either<lb/>
the newspaper photograph of Van Etten, Reed and <unclear>Lahey</unclear> or the one of Cornwell,<lb/>
Reed, Kissinger and myself. You could ask him more specifically about this and<lb/>
you may suggest that he may want to amplify the news item by publishing one or<lb/>
two preliminary sketches. You see that I have deliberately refrained from men-<lb/>
tioning these things heretofore, as I think the <unclear>build up</unclear> should come slowly<lb/>
rather than attempting to swamp Fishbein. I have not intimated yet that you<lb/>
had any intention of buying a large number of reprints of my talk to send with<lb/>
each reproduction. I think this suggestion should come from you to Fishbein<lb/>
via a request to him as to whether he is willing to sell you the generous num-<lb/>
ber of reprints for such distribution with the proper reference given &ldquo;Reprinted<lb/>
(with or without additions) from Hygeia.&rdquo; In other words, I would suggest that<lb/>
you write him saying that I have told you that they were reprinting my article,<lb/>
that they were willing to use the inserts and that in view of that, you were<lb/>
wondering whether you could get enough reprints to send one out with each re-<lb/>
production. You can put this in your letter as if it were an after-thought or<lb/>
just a recent idea. I assume that you wish to have reprints of my article as<lb/>
soon as possible and I think gentle pressure to that end might come from your<lb/>
request for these reprints. You might say that you would like to have them<lb/>
fairly soon.</p>
<p>Do you think that the early appearance of a colored reproduction<lb/>
and story in the New York Sunday Mirror would interfere with Fishbein's plans?<lb/>
You say that this is to come out late this month. I suppose there is not much<lb/>
chance of Fishbein's seeing the New York Mirror anyhow, although if there is a<lb/>
medical article it might come to his attention. Do you think this might change<lb/>
his plans? Do you think he might prefer to have it appear first in Hygeia and<lb/>
to have you postpone the appearance of the New York Sunday Mirror story. In<lb/>
this matter you will have to decide which is more important, a medical circulation<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f05906136"/>
Mr. George A. Kellogg<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>
July 16, 1941<lb/>
with one hundred twenty-five thousand copies or a layman circulation with two<lb/>
million copies. I am glad it is your decision and not mine. Maybe I am unduly<lb/>
concerned and maybe the appearance of neither will conflict with that of the<lb/>
other. I shall be anxious to see the proofs of the reproduction at your<lb/>
earliest convenience.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I hear that Kissinger is improving slowly but<lb/>
is still pathetically ill and that Blossom's trouble was largely nervous,<lb/>
although she is being taken care of &ldquo;tenderly&rdquo; by very sympathetic friends<lb/>
and relatives.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
