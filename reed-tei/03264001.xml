FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Truby:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yesterday in Washington I telephoned your<lb/>
office to ask for an appointment to see you. When I learned that<lb/>
you were out of town I thought that I should do better to write<lb/>
you and tell you what I want to see you about.</p>
<p>I had been talking with General Kean who mentioned your name<lb/>
in connection with Walter <unclear>Reed's</unclear> work on yellow fever in Havana in<lb/>
the summer of 1900. I was seeing the general because I am writing<lb/>
a play which describes that experiment step by step from Reed's<lb/>
first decision to go after the mosquitoes to the certainty of<lb/>
his New Year's Eve letter to Mrs. Reed. I am pretty thoroughly<lb/>
<unclear>saturated</unclear> with the facts of the story. I need all I can get of<lb/>
it personal side. When General Kean spoke of you yesterday as a<lb/>
close friend of Reed's during those days I made up my mind to<lb/>
ask you for an interview.</p>
<p>What I do ask of you, therefor, is the time for a fairly long<lb/>
conversation, for any anecdotes you care to tell me that will<lb/>
help me as a writer to enrich the characters concerned in the story.<lb/>
If you can see your way to granting this request I shall gladly<lb/>
go down to Washington on any day you name.</p>
<p>I know that this is an imposition. I know that I may easily<lb/>
waste your time and my own because it may be extremely difficult to<lb/>
find a manager who will be willing to invest his money in producing<lb/>
a play on a subject so special. I am very serious about it, however,<lb/>
and I am determined to finish the job as honestly and completely as<lb/>
possible. I don't like to talk about myself as a writer but I feel<lb/>
that I owe it to you to refer you to my record in Who's Who. I feel<lb/>
that you will look on the story as well worth telling and that you<lb/>
may look more kindly on me if you know that the chances are good<lb/>
of my doing decently by it. I shall look forward to hearing from<lb/>
you and hope to see you at your convenience either before or after<lb/>
<unclear>Christmas</unclear>.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very Sincerely Yours,</salute>
<signed>Sidney Howard</signed>.
Colonel A. E. Truby.<lb/>
