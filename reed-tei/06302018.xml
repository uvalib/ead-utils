His Excellency Dr. Domingo Ramos<lb/>
Minister of National Defense, Republic of Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Ramos:</salute>
</opener>
<p>My service in Cuba under General Leonard Wood as Supretendente de<lb/>
Beneficencia and again under Governor Magoon as Adviser of the Sanitary Dept.<lb/>
and my personal friendship for both Dr. Carlos Finlay and Dr. Walter Reed<lb/>
have caused me to take great interest in the research being made by Dr.<lb/>
Philip S. Hench of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. into the yellow fever<lb/>
episode in Cuba at the beginning of this century. It is remarkable that<lb/>
a physician of his high professional standing and his preoccupations as a<lb/>
medical author should, in a perfectly disinterested way, devote so much<lb/>
time and labor and pecuniary expense into the investigation of the details<lb/>
of the experiments of the Reed Commission in their famous demonstration of<lb/>
the scientific accuracy of Dr. Finlay's wonderful discovery of the trans-<lb/>
mission of yellow fever by the mosquito (Aedes Egypti) I visited Camp Lazear<lb/>
on the San Jose' finca east of the Calzada Real with Major Reed, and I made<lb/>
the payments, from Insular Funds, of the rent for the land occupied by the<lb/>
camp, to Senor Ignacio Rojas, as shown by records of which Dr. Hench has<lb/>
photostat copies. I am also familiar with the location southwest of the<lb/>
Military Hospital where was located in 1900-1901 the small buildings for<lb/>
the treatment of yellow fever and other infectious diseases, and which was<lb/>
across the railroad to La Playa de Marianao from the Hospital. I was myself<lb/>
a yellow fever patient in one of the huts there in June 1900, being at that<lb/>
time the Chief Surgeon on the Staff of General Fitzhugh Lee, commanding at<lb/>
that time the Military Department of Western Cuba. In this place also Dr. Jesse<lb/>
Lazear died of yellow fever in September, 1900. I am gratified to hear that<lb/>
the Cuban Government has purchased this small area and will preserve it as<lb/>
a memorial to him.</p>
<p>So I am able of my own knowledge, Senor Dr. Ramos, to assure you of<lb/>
the correctness of the facts claimed and established in this matter by Dr.<lb/>
Hench and I hope that you will give him your approval and aid in the laudable<lb/>
aims which he has in view.</p>
<p>I am with much respect,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Jefferson R. Kean</signed>
</closer>
