Miss Maria Teresa Rojas<lb/>
Finca San Jose<lb/>
Redencion, Marianao<lb/>
Habana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Tina:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It was so kind of you to receive our friends, the Wards. We have all been<lb/>
so busy since their return that we have only had a chance to chat with them.<lb/>
They had a delightful visit and were very grateful for your thoughtfulness.<lb/>
It was very kind of you to have Doctor Nogueira call at the same time and<lb/>
show them Camp Lazear. As Doctor Ward said, it certainly visualized what<lb/>
I had been telling him.</p>
<p>It was kind of you to give Doctor Nogueira the extra copy of the SCIENTIFIC<lb/>
MONTHLY. I only want to make absolutely certain that you did have an extra<lb/>
copy. It is my recollection that I gave you one and then last year gave<lb/>
Lidia one, but if I am wrong and if you gave away the only copy which the<lb/>
Finca San Jose now has, you MUST let me know because of all people, it is<lb/>
more important for you to have a copy than anybody else in the world as<lb/>
that is the one &ldquo;official&rdquo; identifying article published by a board member.<lb/>
Please do let me know. If I don't hear from you it means that you do have a<lb/>
copy.</p>
<p>I have been working very hard on some papers and am far behind with my &ldquo;yellow<lb/>
fever&rdquo; correspondence. I appreciate greatly your sending me the cortisone<lb/>
interview and the clippings. I hope to finish the paper I am working on in<lb/>
two or three weeks. I have been working on it night and day almost every night,<lb/>
until three or four a.m. Thereafter I will send you at once a collection of<lb/>
the photographs taken at the dedication of Camp Lazear (my own collection)<lb/>
so that you may see them and let me know which ones you want copies of.</p>
<p>I had an inconsequential note from Mr. <unclear>Bath</unclear> not long ago. He and I still<lb/>
have the Finca San Jose in mind and will certainly keep trying to think of<lb/>
ways and means to help you in your fine cultural project. I think you know<lb/>
me well enough to know that when I get interested in a project I practically<lb/>
never give up and the proper preservation of the Finca San Jose is part and<lb/>
parcel of the preservation of Camp Lazear.</p>
