Dr. Ralph C. Hutchison<lb/>
Washington and Jefferson College<lb/>
Washington, Pennsylvania<lb/>
<salute>My dear Hutch:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have discussed your letter with Dr. Alvarez, one of our con-<lb/>
sultants, who is rather extensively acquainted with medical speakers in the<lb/>
country. We have pooled our suggestions. Incidentally, do you wish me to<lb/>
see Lord Dawson personally? Do you think it would help matters or not? I<lb/>
expect to arrive in London the twenty-fifth of March and probably could see<lb/>
him very shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>I think in many ways it is a good idea to have Lord Dawson, as he<lb/>
is a well known speaker. However, it seems a little inappropriate to have an<lb/>
English speaker as a chief guest to honor work done by American medical men,<lb/>
unless you are after a name, which Dawson is. Dawson is no longer honorary<lb/>
physician to the King. Lord Horner is. Horner is very much interested in<lb/>
rheumatism, chairman of the Imperial Rheumatism Council, and is chairman of<lb/>
one of the congresses to which I am going; but he is a short, none too im-<lb/>
pressive and rather snooty Englishman who did not create a very good impression<lb/>
as a guest at our rheumatism meeting here a few years ago. He decidedly tried<lb/>
to speak down to us as the &ldquo;Great White Father&rdquo;, and as I remember, he spoke<lb/>
too frankly to newspaper reporters on landing in New York, making remarks which<lb/>
were a little indiscreet and undiplomatic. Nevertheless, he is the great &ldquo;I am&rdquo;<lb/>
in England at the moment.</p>
<p>Dr. Alvarez says that de Kruif can speak well if he wants to, but<lb/>
that he has a curious habit of enjoying the opportunity to slight people. Alvarez<lb/>
says that he might delight in accepting and then not show up just to show that<lb/>
he is an independent character. How true an appraisal of de Kruif this is, I<lb/>
do not know.</p>
<p>The Nobel prize winners in current news are still of course Minot,<lb/>
Murphy and Whipple, the three physicians who worked out the liver control of per-<lb/>
nicious anemia. Minot is on our rheumatism committee and I know him fairly well.<lb/>
In fact, he was here as a guest of the Foundation last week. I lunched with him<lb/>
a couple of times and he spent the morning with me in the hospital. He is a fair<lb/>
speaker but hesitates considerably and is not a crackerjack. Murphy is a quite<lb/>
dignified, very nice physician of the old school, not at all impressive, and has<lb/>
gone into retirement more and more since his daughter was killed--burned in an<lb/>
airplane crash last year just a few hours after Mary and I had dinner at their<lb/>
home. I do not know George Whipple but Dr. Alvarez says he is an excellent<lb/>
speaker. He is Dean of the Rochester Medical School and a Trustee of the Rocke-<lb/>
feller Foundation. He has acquired two or three degrees since winning the Nobel<lb/>
prize but Alvarez and I both thought he might be the best choice.</p>
<p>Another excellent speaker is Dr. Hans Zinsser. Having written the<lb/>
recent best seller &ldquo;Rats, Lice and History&rdquo; he is somewhat in the public eye.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03450002"/>
Dr. Ralph C. Hutchison<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>
February 4, 1938<lb/>
He also has a Doctor of Science degree from Leheigh in 1933.</p>
<p>Alexus Carrell, a former Nobel prize winner, I believe is now<lb/>
in Europe where he has been working with Lindbergh on the mechanical lung.<lb/>
His book you have heard of, of course.</p>
<p>Harvey Cushing I understand is an excellent speaker and you of<lb/>
course know of him, the famous neurosurgeon of Harvard.</p>
<p>Surgeon General Parran is much in the public eye. I don't know<lb/>
what kind of a speaker he is.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilbur you of course know and have had, so he is out.</p>
<p>Banting, the Nobel prize winner for insulin, of about 1922 or<lb/>
1923 is not a very good speaker. We are trying to get somebody who is well<lb/>
known and yet has a vital interest in medical history but this is a rather<lb/>
rare combination.</p>
<p>Dr. Francis Packard is Editor of the Annals of Medical History<lb/>
and known in medicine but not to the laymen. The same applies to Dr. Blumer,<lb/>
former Professor of Medicine at Yale.</p>
<p>If you want a name known at once to the general public, perhaps<lb/>
Zinssor or Whipple would be the best. Of course Dr. Will frankly is known<lb/>
more than either of these men, but I realize your feelings in the matter when<lb/>
one remembers that he already has thirty-some honorary degrees. Let me know<lb/>
your preliminary reaction to this list and I shall make further discreet in-<lb/>
quiries concerning your first and second choice.</p>
<p>Is there any possibility that you will be in New York for any sort<lb/>
of a job March 14, 15 or 16? We sail one minute after midnight on the 16th;<lb/>
that is, 12:01 A.M. on the 17th. I have to speak at a medical meeting the<lb/>
evening of the 14th. If you can find an excuse to join us in New York on the<lb/>
16th I will arrange to get theater tickets for &ldquo;I'd Rather Be Right&rdquo;, and the<lb/>
dinner is on me. We will loaf the evening away and you will be requested to<lb/>
see us off on the boat. We would certainly love to have you, and are not<lb/>
proposing any celebration with anybody else in New York until we hear from you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
