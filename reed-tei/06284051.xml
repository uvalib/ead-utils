<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your Memo and photographs<lb/>
were received on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and were<lb/>
followed in the next mail by<lb/>
Gen. Trubys sketch of his service<lb/>
in Cuba during the period of the<lb/>
1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> American intervention 1899-<lb/>
1902- As he wanted me to return<lb/>
the U. S. S. with pencil comments I<lb/>
sat down and read it at once<lb/>
and made a few <unclear>note<del>s</del></unclear> on the<lb/>
margins and backs of the pages-<lb/>
He kept a diary of the Y. F. episode<lb/>
and I imagine a much fuller<lb/>
one than my random factual<lb/>
notes- He also, as he was at the<lb/>
hospital and much of the time<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06284052"/>
2<lb/>
in command of it, was familiar<lb/>
with many details which never<lb/>
came to my attention and saw<lb/>
much more of Reed and the<lb/>
other members of the Commission<lb/>
than I did- His narrative is<lb/>
so of immense value and will<lb/>
rejoice your soul- He has much<lb/>
to say of Lazear and values his<lb/>
contributions to the work of the<lb/>
Commission (as I do) as next to those<lb/>
of Reed- It was he that Lazear<lb/>
asked to look after his papers and<lb/>
possessions and who took from<lb/>
Lazears coat pocket, after his<lb/>
death. The precious little note book<lb/>
with the records of the infected<lb/>
mosquitos or in it- By the way<lb/>
I was talking to Gen. Ireland recently<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06284053"/>
3<lb/>
about the disappearance of Reed's<lb/>
records after his death, and found<lb/>
that altho. he was in the Surg. Gen's<lb/>
Office at that time he knew no more<lb/>
about the matter than I did. It then<lb/>
occurred to me that Mrs. Walter Reed<lb/>
might have the precious note book and<lb/>
other papers; so I wrote to Mrs Reed at<lb/>
once- A prompt reply came from her<lb/>
daughter that Mrs Reed had no papers<lb/>
of her distinguished husband's except<lb/>
personal letters and not many of these<lb/>
as she had given many of them away<lb/>
to friends and libraries- So the mystery<lb/>
of the Reed papers is still unsolved-</p>
<p>I will see if I can carry out your<lb/>
request to get a <unclear>stenog.</unclear> and dictate<lb/>
the answers to your questionnaire<lb/>
paragraph by paragraph. When you<lb/>
get Truby's sketch however I think that<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06284054"/>
4<lb/>
what details I care contribute to<lb/>
the picture will be much diminished<lb/>
in importance: tho. I must confess that<lb/>
I have never seen such a glutton for<lb/>
details and for work as you are-<lb/>
The patient industry with which you<lb/>
persue them fills my rather indolent<lb/>
soul with wonder and admiration-<lb/>
The relocation of Camp Lazear is one<lb/>
of the first fruits of it and I hope<lb/>
that there may be others-</p>
<p>By the way the Medical Faculty of<lb/>
the Univ. of Va. are giving a dinner to<lb/>
Moran on Oct. 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I hope that you may<lb/>
be there, Tho. it would be a long way<lb/>
to come for a dinner-</p>
<p>About my diary I will look over the<lb/>
vol. covering the Summer of 1900 and<lb/>
see if there are enough items of value<lb/>
to warrant copying and will either<lb/>
extract them or lend you the book if I find<lb/>
enough to warrant it- I have no recent news<lb/>
<unclear>of</unclear> the proposal invasion of the Y. F. Roll of Honor-<lb/>
The Surgeon General has an eye on it-</p>
