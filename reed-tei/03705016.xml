<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have neglected answering some of your earlier<lb/>
letters about the photographs because I thought I could<lb/>
get some good views for you from another photographer<lb/>
who was on the scene that day. I do have some photo-<lb/>
graphs of his and will be glad to send you some of them<lb/>
as soon as we have finished using some of these proofs<lb/>
in a publication which we are getting up as a souvenir<lb/>
of the Lazear Building and the South Campus. They are<lb/>
about five by seven inches in size and would make ex-<lb/>
cellent pieces for scrapbooks. When I have them alto-<lb/>
gether, I will forward them to you and you may choose<lb/>
the ones you would like to have.</p>
<p>Pres</p>
<p>In view of these facts, I have withheld send-<lb/>
ing your check through because I thought we could use<lb/>
some part of that check for these recent pictures.<lb/>
Mr. Arnold told me that the pictures he has already<lb/>
forwarded to you came to $18.50. With your permission,<lb/>
I will hold the check until you have picked out some<lb/>
of these smaller pictures.</p>
<p>I am forwarding you, under separate cover, the<lb/>
pictures which you sent to Dr. Hutchison for our Found-<lb/>
ers' Day programs. He asked me to send you also the<lb/>
autographed pictures of Moran and Kissinger which you<lb/>
sent in your letter to him. Are you sure that these<lb/>
pictures were forwarded to us? The only pictures that<lb/>
we have ever gotten of Moran and Kissinger came from<lb/>
the men themselves. I am sending you copies of those<lb/>
pictures which were used in all of our Founders' Day<lb/>
publicity.</p>
<p>When your pictures arrived here before Founders'<lb/>
Day, I remarked to Miss Hough as she gave them to me,<lb/>
that the pictures of Moran and Kissinger were not there<lb/>
as you had indicated in your letter. Is it possible<lb/>

that you have given the pictures to a photographer who<lb/>
has done some work for you in connection with the<lb/>
Lazear research?</p>
