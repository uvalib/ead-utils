<p>Any kind or by petition of reward, and I assure you that<lb/>
you and Mrs Carroll would never have succeeded<lb/>
if he had not taken the matter in hand as he did<lb/>
at the onset and persevered in its accomplishment<lb/>
to the last- While you should be grateful to members of<lb/>
Congress who promised to vote for the measure, the persons<lb/>
to whom you are most indebted are Mr Morse, Hon John<lb/>
Dalzell and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Mansfelde- Without the cooperation<lb/>
of those three gentlemen, the bill would never have<lb/>
come to a vote in the House of Representatives where<lb/>
the fight was carried on, for you know that no opposition<lb/>
was encountered in the Senate- The trouble in the House<lb/>
was all due to the Stubborn refusual of the Pension Committee<lb/>
to report the bill to that body for action- The chairman<lb/>
of that Committee, Mr Loudenslager was inexorable<lb/>
and without his consent the speaker of the House Mr Cannon-<lb/>
would never have allowed the bill to be called <unclear>upon</unclear>-<lb/>
Mr Dalzell was throughly convinced of this and watched<lb/>
his opportunity to introduce the new bill when Mr Loudenslager<lb/>
and Mr Cannon should be absent from Washington- But<lb/>
opportunity came and the new bill was then presented<lb/>
by Mr Dalzell and was passed unanimously- Mr D. had<lb/>
already interviewed the members and secured this promise<lb/>
to vote for the bill- If one member had voted<lb/>
against it, it would have been postponed indefinitely.<lb/>

One did say to Mr D. that he would oppose it but<lb/>
when Mr D. replied it would break his heart if he<lb/>
did so, that person after a few moments consideration<lb/>
approached Mr D and said he would vote with<lb/>
the others and he did so- All was accomplised<lb/>
in a short time and the same forenoon Mr D wired<lb/>
me the result and I immediately sent a telegram<lb/>
to you which you seem to have received about two hours<lb/>
before I sent it, such is the difference between Eastern<lb/>
and Pacific time.-</p>
<p>The credit of changing the bill so as to<lb/>
provide for an &ldquo;<hi>annuity</hi>&rdquo; instead of a &ldquo;<hi>pension</hi>&rdquo; should<lb/>
be accorded to Mr Dalzell- It is true, however, that<lb/>
a few days before the new bill was introduced I<lb/>
wrote to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mansfelde expressing the wish that<lb/>
such a change should be made and suggested<lb/>
that the relief we asked for might be called<lb/>
an &ldquo;annuity&rdquo;, So as to take the whole matter<lb/>
out of the hands of the Pension Committee-<lb/>
I had no idea that the same thought<lb/>
would occur to others - But it did occur<lb/>
to Mr Dalzell though I was not aware of<lb/>
this until I saw a copy of the new bill<lb/>
after it had been passed- This was merely<lb/>

a coincidence easily explained by the fact that Mr Dalzell<lb/>
and I are both lawyers and knew the legal meaning<lb/>
of the magic word &ldquo;annuity&rdquo;- I never suggested the<lb/>
change to Mr Dalzell and I am confident that<lb/>
he naturally fell into the same idea as I did<lb/>
without suggestions from any person- It was<lb/>
all original with him and he is entitled<lb/>
exclusively to the credit-</p>
<p>Next week I expect to visit Windsor<lb/>
and to remain there three or four weeks- I want<lb/>
to have the pleasure of the society of Kates family<lb/>
and <unclear>Sister</unclear> Charlie, as I call Mrs Sweitzer, and to<lb/>
do all I can for the comfort of that family- The<lb/>
sudden death of Thomas Seth has been very distressing<lb/>
to them all- After that visit I may take<lb/>
a trip to Canada with my son Jesse and grandson<lb/>
John Lazear-</p>
<p>I suppose you have received your first<lb/>
payment from Washington on account of your<lb/>
annuity- It was due on the 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> of June.</p>
<p>With much love to you all</p>
