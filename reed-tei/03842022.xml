<p>Hench sends Rojas copies of his yellow fever article and of a letter he has sent to Adrian Macia concerning the purchase of the Camp Lazear site. He describes his plans for the proposed memorial, and informs her that the San Jose farm was evidently the site of Carlos J. Finlay's yellow fever experiments, in 1883.</p>

<salute>My dear Senora Rojas:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am afraid you will think I have forgotten all about my good friends<lb/>
in Havana and of my interest in Finca San Jose. But I have been so busy with<lb/>
professional duties that I have not had as much time as I would wish for my in-<lb/>
vestigations on the history of the conquest of yellow fever. Permit me to en-<lb/>
close herein a copy of a recent article of mine which I believe will interest you.<lb/>
I am also sending you (to regard as <hi>confidential</hi>) a  <hi>carbon copy of a letter I</hi><lb/>
have sent to Senor Macia. I am anxious to proceed with our plans. By separate<lb/>
post I am sending <hi>twelve copies</hi> of my Hygeia article for your good relatives and<lb/>
friends. In this article I purposely refrained from discussing the Finca San Jose<lb/>
as I do not want too much information to get out prematurely until we have actually<lb/>
purchased the site of Camp Lazear. I am preparing another article on &ldquo;The Identi-<lb/>
fication of Camp Lazear on the San Jose Farm&rdquo; (or some such title) which will be<lb/>
written with Senors Moran and Pogolotti as co-authors. When the first draft is<lb/>
completed I will send two copies to Senors Moran and Pogolotti, also to you so that<lb/>
you can be sure I have spoken the truth. When it is completed we will publish it<lb/>
in this country and I hope we can publish it simultaneously in some Cuban medical<lb/>
journal. I am sure we can. <hi>Then</hi> I will ask Miss Cabrera to let one of her news-<lb/>
paper friends see it and use as much of it (in a dignified way) as seems proper.</p>
<p>I do want memorial stones on the spots where Buildings Number One and Two<lb/>
were, also a memorial bronze plaque on the corner wall of your property on Calzada<lb/>
Real. Where we will have the little building housed permanently remains to be de-<lb/>
termined.</p>
<p>If you or your relatives can give me any comments on the data I have<lb/>
written to Senor Macia I would be very grateful. I know nothing of the cost of<lb/>
Cuban labor or material and will need much of your kindly advice and council.</p>
<p>I found out one most interesting thing which I do not believe I told you<lb/>
<unclear>and</unclear> which will greatly enhance the historical value of Finca San Jose as far as<lb/>
Cubans especially are concerned. On page 82 of his new (1940) book &ldquo;Carlos Finlay<lb/>
and Yellow Fever&rdquo;, Dr. C. E. Finlay writes thus: "The fourth case is still more con-<lb/>
vincing. It is reported in detail in several of his papers. The experiment was<lb/>
performed at a pleasure farm &ldquo;La Asuncion&rdquo; owned by the Jesuit Fathers, where they<lb/>
sent their non-immune members during the summer months. It was situated outside<lb/>
the regular thoroughfares at a place called &lsquo;Los Quemados&rsquo; some 9 kilometers from<lb/>
Havana. The only way to reach it at that time was by a flag station on the Marianao<lb/>
Railroad. The distance from it to the farm was about 1 kilometer across fields;<lb/>
this place was alluded to by Dr. Chaille in his report of the yellow fever commission<lb/>

Senora Maria Teresa Loma viuda de Rojas<lb/>
November 22, 1941<lb/>
which visited Havana in 1879. During the 11 years during which this farm had been<lb/>
in possession of the Jesuits prior to the inoculations I am about to refer to, not<lb/>
a single case of yellow fever had developed there (due to the absence of Aedes),<lb/>
so it could be considered as free from yellow fever at the time the experiment was<lb/>
performed. The subject experimented upon was Rev. E. Urra, S. J. He was trans-<lb/>
ferred to the farm and kept three weeks under strict observation without developing<lb/>
the disease. On July 15, 1883 he was inoculated by a mosquito which had bitten a<lb/>
yellow fever patient in his seventh day.------etc."</p>
<p>Such is the version published by son Finlay. But Gen. Kean noted that the<lb/>
following appears in the book &ldquo;Carlos Finlay&rdquo; by Prof. Francisco Dominguez (1935).<lb/>
On page 122 one reads: &ldquo;The American Commission, to make its experiments, esta-<lb/>
blished itself at &ldquo;Los Quemados&rdquo; in the San Jose estate where Finlay had formerly<lb/>
made his experiments and where in 1883 he had inoculated the Rev. Father Urra, a<lb/>
case which was seen by many doctors and accepted by all as positive for yellow<lb/>
fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You see that these two versions contradict each other in part: Finlay's<lb/>
early experiment (on Father Urra, at least) was done on the Jesuits &ldquo;La Asuncion&rdquo;<lb/>
in Quemados according to Finlay's son, on the Jesuit's farm &ldquo;San Jose <add>farm</add>&rdquo; in Quemados<lb/>
according to Dominguez.</p>
<p>The day before I left Havana (after seeing you) I lunched with Dr. Finlay<lb/>
and called his attention to this contradiction. He gave me the following correction.<lb/>
He told me that his father's first two experiments (including that on Father Urra)<lb/>
were done on the San Jose farm later used as Camp Lazear. Later experiments were<lb/>
done at the Asuncion farm in Luyano (10 miles from Havana). When the Jesuits closed<lb/>
their lease on the San Jose farm they went to La Asuncion. The choice of the San<lb/>
Jose farm by Reed and his colleagues may have been purely coincidental or it may<lb/>
have been selected by Reed's advisers because they knew from the previous writings of<lb/>
Dr. Chaille and from the experience of Finlay that the San Jose farm was essentially<lb/>
free of yellow fever. It may have had that reputation. Whether Reed know that<lb/>
Finlay had previously worked at the San Jose farm in 1883 I do not know-if he did,<lb/>
he did not mention it in any of his writings.</p>
<p>Now I wonder if you knew that Finlay had done any of his early work on<lb/>
yellow fever at the San Jose farm in 1883. If I am correct it was then owned by<lb/>
the Pedroso family and apparently rented by them to the Jesuits (from about 1873 to<lb/>
1884 or 1885 ?? is this correct? Dr. C. E. Finlay says they had it 11 years. My<lb/>
notes say that Dr. C. E. Finlay thought the Jesuits moved from the San Jose farm to<lb/>
Asuncion about 1884 or 1885. He remembered visiting the San Jose Farm with his father<lb/>
in 1884 to see Father Urra. He recognized my photo of the old house at San Jose.)<lb/>
If I am correct also you, Senora Rojas, had not yet married Senor Pedroso in 1883.<lb/>
Therefore when you later married Senor Pedroso and still later when Senor Rojas<lb/>
loaned Finca San Jose to Dr. Reed neither you nor your husband, Senor Rojas, may<lb/>
have known that Finlay had also worked there.</p>

<p>November 22, 1941</p>
<p>I am most anxious to hear what you recall about this. Did you know of<lb/>
Finlay's use of the San Jose farm in 1883? You and your daughter have been so<lb/>
successful in uncovering the important diary of Senor Rojas, I wonder if you could<lb/>
find in the 1883 records of the Pedroso family any remarks as to the rental of the<lb/>
San Jose farm to the Jesuits.</p>
<p>In memorializing the San Jose Farm and the site of Camp Lazear, you can<lb/>
readily see how the historical importance of the farm would be greatly enhanced for<lb/>
all concerned (not just the Cubans) if we could definitely establish by written<lb/>
records of the Pedroso family the exact dates when the Jesuits came and left the<lb/>
San Jose farm. May I enlist the excellent detective services of your daughter<lb/>
Senora Maria Teresa and of Miss Cabrera. I would greatly appreciate hearing from<lb/>
you or them.</p>
<p>If you would care to have more of my reprints or some large copies of<lb/>
the painting I will see that you receive them with my compliments.</p>
<p>Please accept the kindest regards of Mrs. Hench and me for yourself<lb/>
and the other members of your very charming family.</p>
