<salute>Dear Mother</salute>
</opener>
<p>No one wrote last Sunday because we<lb/>
(L. Jr. Magruder &amp; I,) went on an excursion to<lb/>
East Key -- 4 miles off after shells &amp;<lb/>
I came back with a most awful headache<lb/>
so that I was no <unclear>account all</unclear> yesterday.</p>
<p>I am going over <unclear>to</unclear> to key West. Quaran-<lb/>
tine to night to <unclear>be had</unclear> tomorrow night- &amp; it<lb/>
may be that after this time <unclear>El Forten</unclear> can go to the<lb/>
Dock &amp; me get a<unclear>shave</unclear>- Our Q. is over Nov. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> but<lb/>
Fla holds to Nov 15 However that is nearly here.<lb/>
How L. is to get <unclear>away</unclear> is <unclear>to leave</unclear> this fall, is a<lb/>
problem to me, <unclear>rough is the</unclear> name for the water<lb/>
from this place to Key West &amp; thence to Tampa-two<lb/>
trips are of 8. or 10 &amp; the other of 20 to 24 hours.<lb/>
However we would pick as nice a day as we<lb/>
could, &amp; by watching our chance might get through. There<lb/>
<hi>has</hi> been no calm day however - since the hurricane,<lb/>
L. is very well &amp; so are the children. I will have<lb/>
more time <hi>now &amp;</hi> am beginning Laura's French<lb/>
&amp; arithmetic, Henry is reading very fairly,<lb/>
&amp; Ned has quite a turn for his books, especially<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00723002"/>
C1<lb/>
B23<lb/>
for writing &amp; making figures.</p>
<p><unclear>H.</unclear> has an air gun &amp; has killed 5 (&amp; Laura<lb/>
1) birds this week shoots #1 shot.<lb/>
I do not know whether it is too late to fish now or<lb/>
not; have not been for a long time &amp; in rough water<lb/>
it is the reverse of pleasant to be dancing about in a<lb/>
small boat. We got a lot of pretty shells on the keys<lb/>
There is no comparison between the beauty of the <unclear>shells</unclear><lb/>
here &amp; at Chandeleur - although except rose Conches-<lb/>
there are more shells at Chandeleur. And crab-<lb/>
I thought that when we found 11 kinds at Chandeleur<lb/>
we had enough. But here unless we suppose varieties<lb/>
sport, like seed fruit.- I should say that I have seen<lb/>
<hi>100</hi> kinds. The spotted (&ldquo;leopard&rdquo;) crabs live<lb/>
here. none to eat however - the more is the pity,<lb/>
&amp; fish too are decidedly scarce-oysters unknown<lb/>
so as an eating place it is inferior to Chandeleur,<lb/>
I am not sorry to have seen it &amp; will be glad to leave<lb/>
it. I almost expect however it would be better for<lb/>
me to stay here this winter for the children's sake<lb/>
To think of going through a winter without a sore<lb/>
throat or bad-cold for the <hi>4</hi> (L. Sr.) of them?<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00723003"/>
It is worth something. It will be too late any<lb/>
way to put them to school when I can get ashore<lb/>
to do any good &amp; they will learn as much here<lb/>
as else where. They should have fairly developed<lb/>
ideas of geography any way &amp; know no little<lb/>
about somethings. I wish they had a home<lb/>
however.</p>
<p>After Quarantine, we will have but<lb/>
two regular mails per week although<lb/>
we may occasionally get off on a fishing<lb/>
<unclear>much</unclear>. Rev. cutter or light house Tender, in<lb/>
between times.</p>
<p>I am hoping to go up to Tampa to see my<lb/>
Orange grove in November- It costs<del>$24.00</del><add>$21.00</add><lb/>
K. W. to Tampa. &amp; return. So I can make<lb/>
the return trip for about $40.00 may<lb/>
be $50.00. I hear that the place is doing<lb/>
fairly well. To bring on the <hi>23</hi> acres of<lb/>
young trees<add>&amp;</add> costs about $150, per annum<lb/>
more than the old grove yields - although last<lb/>
year. - I came out 16 cents <hi>ahead</hi>, &amp; that is doing<lb/>
well, I have 25 acres in all you know, &amp; the<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00723004"/>
C1<lb/>
B23<lb/>
old grove <hi>clears</hi> about $50.00 per acre <add>over its own expenses</add> one year - <lb/>
with another I have <hi>27</hi> <add>more</add> trees bearing next year<lb/>
than I have had - old trees that were moved so<lb/>
it may increase about $15.00 per annum,<lb/>
I hope so.</p>
<p>I suspect that Buchmaster (at the U. of Va.) is a good ap-<lb/>
pointee. He is editor of a well edited journal,<lb/>
<unclear>which</unclear> generally means enterprise ability &amp; not much prac-<lb/>
tice. At any rate it is well to break the tradi-<lb/>
tion they have fallen into - of only appointing<lb/>
their <unclear>own</unclear> men. Christian, I am sure, is a bad<lb/>
appointment.</p>
<p>I wish I could spend this fall at home, Mother<lb/>
I believe the happiest time I have had for<lb/>
years was the fall (part of November only) I spent<lb/>
at <unclear>North</unclear> River with L. &amp; the children before I went<lb/>
to Savannah.</p>
<p><hi>All</hi> send love.</p>
