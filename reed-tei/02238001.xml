<hi>Sunday night</hi>.<lb/>
<salute>My darling wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yesterday I<lb/>
had not only a letter from sweet-<lb/>
-est &ldquo;oomsey&rdquo;, but one, also, from<lb/>
dear little Annapolis Reed.<lb/>
What sweet letters they were!<lb/>
No talking about <hi>bills</hi> &amp; such<lb/>
disagreeable subjects, but just<lb/>
plain, sensible, nice letters.<lb/>
So my sweet wifie thinks<lb/>
that she had better stay<lb/>
where she is and not venture<lb/>
on the Atlantic at this<lb/>
season of the year. I am so<lb/>
very glad that you have con-<lb/>
cluded not to come, as it<lb/>
worried me so to know that<lb/>
my sweetheart wanted to<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02238002"/>
come and I couldn't consent to<lb/>
it- You will be so much more<lb/>
comfortable where you are-<lb/>
I see no reason why my<lb/>
darling Miss Gouty and the<lb/>
charming Miss Annapolis<lb/>
shouldn't have a good time<lb/>
this week with all those at-<lb/>
tractions at the theatres -- with<lb/>
<unclear>Mand</unclear> Adams and the Divine<lb/>
Sarah, you ought to manage<lb/>
to &ldquo;worry along&rdquo; for a while.<lb/>
While I think of it, mother, dear,<lb/>
there will be <hi>five</hi> mails here-<lb/>
after, each week, instead<lb/>
of three as heretofore- So that<lb/>
you can write just as often<lb/>
as you please and when you<lb/>
please- Isn't that fine? Hur-<lb/>
ry up now, dearest heart,<lb/>
and write <hi>five</hi> times a week!<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02238003"/>
Another thing, mother, dear: please<lb/>
give that precious little scholar<lb/>
<hi>one dollar</hi> for her father- I would<lb/>
have sent it right away, but<lb/>
I sent dearest &ldquo;oomsey&rdquo; nearly<lb/>
all I had &amp; haven't a dollar<lb/>
bill left- You just let her have<lb/>
it for being such a sweet child<lb/>
and I will pay you back when<lb/>
I come- Don't forget this, please -<lb/>
concerning the question whether<lb/>
the larvae of the infected mosquito<lb/>
can convey the disease, we haven't<lb/>
yet been able to say- You see<lb/>
we could only take larvae hatched<lb/>
from the eggs of those insects that<lb/>
have <hi>already</hi> conveyed the disease<lb/>
&amp; <hi>after</hi> they have conveyed it-<lb/>
We have only, <hi>to-day</hi>, our <hi>first</hi><lb/>
eggs from such insects which<lb/>
we will try, of course - Since<lb/>
I last wrote you, we have infec-<lb/>
ted two men by injecting the<lb/>
blood of a case under the skin<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02238004"/>
of the healthy individual- This shows<lb/>
that the parasite is in the general<lb/>
circulation and that yellow fever, like<lb/>
Malaria, can be conveyed by the mos-<lb/>
quito's bite or by infection of the<lb/>
blood- Isn't that interesting?<lb/>
Never mind, lovie, dear, what the<lb/>
profession thinks now, they will<lb/>
come around after awhile-<lb/>
No one who has seen our cases<lb/>
and the circumstances under which<lb/>
they were infected, but admits,<lb/>
at once, that we have conclu-<lb/>
sively proven the whole thing-<lb/>
How is that <hi>gouty toe</hi>, Miss<lb/>
Farmer-lady? Still drinking only<lb/>
milk and mineral waters? my!<lb/>
but that ought to be fattening!<lb/>
wait till I get back, if you want<lb/>
to see <hi>eating</hi>! Did I tell you that<lb/>
I weigh 148 lbs. in my light clothing?<lb/>
I am getting to be actually <hi>too fat</hi>!<lb/>
Good-night, you sweet, sweet girls!<lb/>
Love &amp; kisses for my own precious<lb/>
children- Boo! Boo! You Joys!</p>
