Dr. John A. Ferrell,<lb/>
Director for the United States,<lb/>
International Health Board,<lb/>
61 Broadway, New York, N. Y.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Ferrell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of July 26/22, addressed to me at Marion, N. C., just<lb/>
to hand.</p>
<p>In answer to your request for suggestions of field studies or<lb/>
demonstrations of malaria which it seems advisable to make I would name<lb/>
the following:</p>
<p>1) A study of the effect of impounding water on the incidence of malaria.</p>
<p>This study was begun in 1914 and carried on, during 1915 and 1916,<lb/>
by LePrince: Griffitts and myself. Some surveys, minor, but not with-<lb/>
out value, have been made by Griffitts and myself since that time and<lb/>
the study suggested would be in continuation (completion?) of the work<lb/>
already done.</p>
<p>The problem is of much economic and sanitary importance and I<lb/>
think that a moderate amount of work for not less than two years and a<lb/>
much smaller amount, as inspection and observation only, continued for<lb/>
some years longer, (how many I cannot say) would be well repaid.</p>
<p>I have been purposing, when I have a little more data on this<lb/>
subject and some spare time, to write up the findings we have been able<lb/>
to arrive at so far and especially to formulate the measures advisable<lb/>
for preventing, or at least minimising, malaria caused by making these<lb/>
large ponds. A good deal of data for this purpose is already available.<lb/>
<unclear>&amp;</unclear> I hope to get a little more this fall.</p>
<p>The general method of study for the first two years would be<lb/>
(a) select a location in which a large body of water will be impounded<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00937019"/>
impounded<lb/>
2.<lb/>
within a year or two--a hydro-electric plant in the making is the best<lb/>
possible--(b) Make a survey (1) of the incidence of malaria in this<lb/>
section: (2) of the Anopheles production, noting breeding places: species<lb/>
and prevalence in residences.</p>
<p>These surveys should not only cover the flowage area of the pur-<lb/>
posed pond, but should extend, roughly, a mile or mile and a half be-<lb/>
yond the flowage contour--indeed, the survey, especially as to the spe-<lb/>
cies of Anopheles and the production in this area beyond the contour<lb/>
should be especially <del>noted.</del><add>full.</add></p>
<p>There is no need of including the whole of the area indicated<lb/>
in the survey; this might involve a very large amount of work. It is<lb/>
sufficient that cross-sections be taken, a half mile to a mile wide, at<lb/>
suitable places so as to sample the country we are investigating. This<lb/>
limitation is especially advised for the Anopheles survey. The malaria<lb/>
survey is so much easier made that this may, except in very large ponds--<lb/>
that of Lock 17, Black Warrior--was over 65 miles long--be made to in-<lb/>
clude all people in the area indicated.</p>
<p>An examination of the same territory--after the pond is filled<lb/>
and for as many years thereafter as may be necessary--should give us<lb/>
data to determine the effect of the impounded water on the incidence<lb/>
of malaria: Naturally, there are a number of other factors to be noted,<lb/>
but this is the general plan.</p>
<p>Detail, and modifications advisable, of the above general plan<lb/>
should be given only if this study be undertaken as it would involve<lb/>
some time to write them out.</p>
<p>The above was what was planned and, more or less imperfectly, car-<lb/>
ried out in 1915 and 1916.</p>
<p>A working party should consist of a chief (man of status of<lb/>
Barber or Griffitts) with two or three intelligent young men for helpers<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00937020"/>
helpers (<lb/>
3.<lb/>
(students on vacation are about the type needed) and a Ford automobile.<lb/>
This is for the surveys of areas before the water is impounded. After<lb/>
the pond is filled, the use of a motor boat--usually cheaply obtain-<lb/>
able from the Power Company--and one or two small skiffs or canoes are<lb/>
necessary in addition. The skiffs should be furnished with Evenrude<lb/>
motors.</p>
<p>One such party should be able to examine for two large ponds and<lb/>
transportation between them must be provided <add>for several trips</add></p>
<p>The work will last only during the season of contaminative Ano-<lb/>
pheles production--May 1st. -October 31st. as a maximum: mainly from<lb/>
June 1st.-Oct 31st.</p>
<p>The cost I cannot estimate. A guess estimate would be about<lb/>
$12,500 to $15,000.00 each year for the first two years and about 67%<lb/>
to 50% of that amount for--say five years thereafter--not necessarily<lb/>
consecutive years.</p>
<p>The estimate is for one party with three assistants, working--<lb/>
the Chief twelve and the assistants 6 1/2 months.</p>
<p>It is possible enough that the intensive work outlined for the<lb/>
first two years would need to be repeated--so as to cover at least <hi>four</hi><lb/>
large ponds--in which case the larger estimate should hold for four years.</p>
<p>2) Study of Cypress swamp breeding of Anopheles.</p>
<p>This involves, and unquestionably includes, a study of such<lb/>
breeding at a distance from the blood-supply furnished by man and domestic<lb/>
animals.</p>
<p>I had purposed to take this up, in a small way, in 1917, but the<lb/>
war prevented. It is of some importance, both from a scientific and a<lb/>
practical standpoint, but especially from the former. Of much less im-<lb/>
portance than (1), but is an absolutely untouched problem.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f00937021"/>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Estimate of cost--about $12,500.00 to $15,000.00 per annum--or<lb/>
rather less--for--say--<hi>two</hi> years. Same field party as for Impounded<lb/>
Water, but no launch needed.</p>
<p>3) To determine the different valencies <hi>in nature</hi> of our three<lb/>
principal species of Anopheles as vectors of malaria.</p>
<p>Dr. Fricks is already working on this problem, as regards the<lb/>
role of A. punctipennis compared with the other two, but I am sure he<lb/>
would be glad to be able to extend this work.</p>
<p>It is obviously most important. Indeed, I have considered it<lb/>
the most important of the field problems of malaria yet unsolved, and<lb/>
have done some epidemiological (field) work on it myself.</p>
<p>The methods and costs of carrying them out can be obtained from<lb/>
Dr. Fricks better than from myself. The expense will depend, naturally,<lb/>
on the extent to which the work is carried.</p>
<p>4) To study how best to combine control of malaria (control<lb/>
of Anopheles production?) with the large scale drainage projects for<lb/>
agriculture.</p>
<p>I think this is not in the class of studies to which your letter<lb/>
refers. It is, however, important and, I am sure, feasible.</p>
<p>Obviously, both the efficacy of the Anopheles control and the<lb/>
economical adaptation of the measures therefor to the drainage work,<lb/>
must be considered. It should begin by a preliminary study, <hi>in the<lb/>
field where drainage work is going on</hi>, by a thoroughly competent malarial<lb/>
engineer in consultation with a drainage engineer. During this, the<lb/>
measures tentatively agreed on by both as necessary to control Anophe-<lb/>
les production and allowable from a drainage standpoint could be checked up.</p>
<p>Practically the only expenses for this preliminary work would be<lb/>
the pay of the malaria engineer and his travelling expenses--for he<lb/>
should visit more than one drainage project. It would need one of the<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00937022"/>
of the<lb/>
5.<lb/>
very best of our engineers, however.</p>
<p>If this should result in the general adoption of measures for<lb/>
the control of Anopheles by drainage engineers, and it might well be<lb/>
an important step thereto, its value would be very great. We have been<lb/>
trying since 1917 to get these men interested in malaria control, so<lb/>
that the lands fitted for agriculture by drainage might be, by the same<lb/>
measure, freed from malaria: This has not, by any means, always been<lb/>
the case.</p>
<p>The repetition, in various places and times, of Mitzmain's<lb/>
work at Monroe, La., in 1917, to determine the last date in the fall at<lb/>
which Anopheles are infective to men.</p>
<p>This is important, as giving us the date in the fall at which it<lb/>
is safe to suspend oiling and other measures for the control of Anophe-<lb/>
les production. I think the saving to my Service in 1918, due to this<lb/>
knowledge, was not less than $150,000.00.</p>
<p>This is a purely scientific study--partly field and partly bench--<lb/>
and a working party should consist of one entomological microscopist and<lb/>
a helper. More than one party can be used--and for several years.</p>
<p>This work, however, as it can be done for only about one month<lb/>
per annum in any one district, had best be made a side issue to other<lb/>
work of the same kind--such as Barber and Mayne are doing now. I doubt<lb/>
then if this falls in the category of the class of studies you mean. I<lb/>
think not.</p>
