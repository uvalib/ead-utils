<p>Our Duty in Cuba.</p>
<p>We have not the slightest doubt that<lb/>
Senor Cisneros, when he threatened the<lb/>
United States with war, on Thursday last,<lb/>
spoke for an overwhelming majority of<lb/>
the Cuban convention which he was then<lb/>
addressing. The only difference between<lb/>
Cisneros and the horde of professional<lb/>
outlaws our authorities have been petting<lb/>
and coddling for the past two years is<lb/>
that he reveals his purpose, while they<lb/>
nurse it in malignant silence. We think<lb/>
now, as we have always thought, that our<lb/>
government has managed the Cuban sit-<lb/>
uation with almost inspired fatuity. We<lb/>
believe, as we have always believed, that<lb/>
in giving power, place, and emolument to<lb/>
the incendiary leaders and ignoring the<lb/>
representatives of property, culture, and<lb/>
conservatism we have made impossible a<lb/>
peaceful solution of the Cuban imbroglio<lb/>
or a satisfactory fulfillment of whatever<lb/>
promise may have been contained in the<lb/>
Teller amendment to the war resolutions<lb/>
of 1898.</p>
<p>Senor Cisneros, we may say, is entitled<lb/>
to far more respect now than at any time<lb/>
in his history. When he was darting<lb/>
about from one refuge to another in the<lb/>
Cuban hills, and carrying with him the<lb/>
whole of the alleged &ldquo;civil government&rdquo;<lb/>
of the patriots on a single mule, he made<lb/>
no appeal to the recognition of intelligent<lb/>
men. On the contrary, he presented a<lb/>
spectacle of ragamuffin absurdity which<lb/>
almost moved one to tears. But now,<lb/>
when he takes his courage in both hands<lb/>
and proclaims to the world his hatred of<lb/>
&ldquo;the intervening power&rdquo; and his fixed de-<lb/>
termination to resist its encroachments to<lb/>
the bitter end, he is at least the figure of<lb/>
a brave and candid man. We know upon<lb/>
overwhelming testimony that what he<lb/>
says is what nine-tenths of his fellow-<lb/>
agitators feel, and we see in him a person<lb/>
who dares to speak his mind.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that the President means<lb/>
to assemble Congress in extra session at<lb/>
an early date. He has borne the respon-<lb/>
sibility of this wretched Cuban business<lb/>
long enough. No doubt he has acted in a<lb/>
spirit of sincere humanity and patriotism,<lb/>
but in one way or another things have<lb/>
gone wrong from the first, and are get-<lb/>
ting to be more and more perilous and<lb/>
complicated every day. It is high time<lb/>
that Congress should assume the task of<lb/>
interpreting its own pledges and realizing<lb/>
its own theories. Far too much has been<lb/>
made of the Teller resolution. It contains<lb/>
a promise, perhaps, and therefore should<lb/>
be taken into serious account. But there<lb/>
are higher and more sacred obligations<lb/>
which must be discharged before that<lb/>
promise can be considered. No matter<lb/>
how anxious we may be to dismiss Cuba<lb/>
to its destiny and wash our hands of it,<lb/>
there are other duties to ourselves and to<lb/>
the civilized world which have a prior<lb/>
claim. If we promised Cuba independence<lb/>
and self-government, we also promised<lb/>
Cuba's inhabitants peace, order, and se-<lb/>
curity, and made ourselves responsible to<lb/>
the powers for that consummation. Those<lb/>
powers stood aside, postponing the asser-<lb/>
tion of their interests and trusting us to<lb/>
protect and guarantee them. We are<lb/>
bound to make sure of this before we<lb/>
withdraw from the island and leave it to<lb/>
the mercies and devices of its direst ene-<lb/>
mies.</p>
<p>Let us have a definite settlement of<lb/>
these questions by all means. To with-<lb/>
draw from Cuba before its enlightened<lb/>
government is assured would be far more<lb/>
dishonorable than to seize it outright and<lb/>
finally remove the problem from the arena<lb/>
of discussion.</p>
