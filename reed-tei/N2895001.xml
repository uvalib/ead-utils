<p>trained to take the place of the majority<lb/>
of the American teaheers. The latter<lb/>
are at present employed for the most<lb/>
part as superintendents and instructors<lb/>
in English. Twenty Filipino students<lb/>
have completed a four-years' ocurse in<lb/>
various Aemrican universities and col-<lb/>
leges and are returning to the islands<lb/>
this year, where they are under contract<lb/>
with the government to serve four years<lb/>
in the Philippine civil service. Most of<lb/>
them will become teachers of English and<lb/>
in time some of them are expected to<lb/>
earn promotion to the grade of superin-<lb/>
tendent. Other students are on their<lb/>
way to the United States to take he<lb/>
places of the twenty graduated this year.<lb/>
At least one of these Filipinos will enter<lb/>
the Massachusetts <unclear>Institue</unclear> of Technolo-<lb/>
gy and upon the completion of the course<lb/>
there will return to the islands and as-<lb/>
sist in the development of a technical ed-<lb/>
ucation. There are about 150 Filipino<lb/>
students left in the United States, and<lb/>
by the opening of the academic year this<lb/>
number will be increased to nearly two<lb/>
hundred. It is too early yet to give<lb/>
the results of this movement to educate<lb/>
Filipino students in this country, but it<lb/>
is declared at the bureau of insular af-<lb/>
fairs that the earnestness and thorough-<lb/>
ness with which the great majority of<lb/>
the Filipinos sent here are prosecuting<lb/>
their work promise that the benefits con-<lb/>
templated by the inaugurators of the<lb/>
movement will be abundantly secured.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Governor Magoon's arraignment of<lb/>
sanitary conditions in Cuba contained in<lb/>
his long cablegram to the war depart-<lb/>
ment made public today has had a de-<lb/>
pressing effect upon the officials here<lb/>
and has opened the eyes of the public to<lb/>
a condition which had hitherto not<lb/>
caused concern. It is no exaggeration to<lb/>
say that the absolute failure of the Cu-<lb/>
bans to continue the efficient system of<lb/>
sanitation initiated by the American mi-<lb/>
litary regime places the date for the<lb/>
restoration of the Cuban republic further<lb/>
into the future than the recent depre-<lb/>
dation of outlaws in various parts of the<lb/>
island.</p>
<p>Governor Magoon's cablegram setting<lb/>
forth clearly and in detail the actual<lb/>
state of affairs was sent in response to<lb/>
a request for information from Secretary<lb/>
Taft who was somewhat annoyed at the<lb/>
inability of the war department to furn-<lb/>
ish the president and the public with<lb/>
a full statement of health <unclear>conditions</unclear> in<lb/>
Cuba as soon as the outbreak of yellow<lb/>
fever occurred at Cienfuegos. What Gov-<lb/>
ernor Magoon says is also borne out by<lb/>
Major J. R. Kean, who is in charge of<lb/>
the campaign against yellow fever in<lb/>
Cuba, and in whom the administration<lb/>
here has every confidence. Major Kean's<lb/>
reports show the inability of the central<lb/>
government under the present system to<lb/>
control sanitary conditions in the cities<lb/>
and towns. It was under the control of<lb/>
the local authorities and the wisdom of<lb/>
Governor Magoon in insisting upon Fed-<lb/>
eral control of sanitation is appreciated<lb/>
more than ever since the Cienfuegos out-<lb/>
break. Before this letter is published the<lb/>
war department expects to har that the<lb/>
governor's decree nationalizing the pub-<lb/>
lic health service in Cuba has been is-<lb/>
sued and it is proposed to back him up<lb/>
in his plan for completing the water<lb/>
and sewerage systems in ten or fifteen<lb/>
cities within the next fifteen months.<lb/>
The governor's report has been sent to<lb/>
the president, and it is naturally a mat-<lb/>
ter of satisfaction to the officials here<lb/>
that the blame for he situation does not<lb/>
rest upon the medical officers of he<lb/>
American army in Cuba. The indifference<lb/>
of the Cubans to the disease has long<lb/>
been recognized as an obstacle in the<lb/>
way of its eradication and the situation<lb/>
is further complicated by the unwilling-<lb/>
ness of the native physicians to report<lb/>
yellow fever and other fevers. The woe-<lb/>
ful neglect of sanitary precautions by<lb/>
the Cubans is a matter of considerable<lb/>
amazement to those who have not kept<lb/>
in touch with island conditions since the<lb/>
American evacuation.</p>
<p>The exposure of the present conditions<lb/>
in his characteristically frank and vig-<lb/>
orous fashion will bring to Governor Ma-<lb/>
goon's support every facility which the<lb/>
administration at Washington can furn-<lb/>
ish. Above all else the prejudice of the<lb/>
Cubans against modern sanitation will<lb/>
be absolutely ignored. On this the pres-<lb/>
dent and his administration are unani-<lb/>
mous. Of course, the paving and sewer-<lb/>
ing of Havana and the other cities will<lb/>
cause inconvenience and may hurt busi-<lb/>
ness for a time, while the streets are<lb/>
blocked by the improvements. But the<lb/>
work will go on and in the end it is be-<lb/>
lieved the Cuban people will be brought<lb/>
to see the wisdom of these improvements<lb/>
and that then opposition will give place<lb/>
to gratitude.</p>
<p>But the president has made it plain<lb/>
that gratitude is not what he is looking<lb/>
for in colonial administration. The Fili-<lb/>
pinos are not as grateful as they might<lb/>
be for what the American government<lb/>
has accomplished in their behalf, and<lb/>
there are doubtless those in Cuba who<lb/>
will attribute to any reform projected<lb/>
by the provisional government a sinister<lb/>
motive. It can not be too strongly re-<lb/>
iterated that this will not deter the<lb/>
reform program oulined by the admini-<lb/>
stration which is to be put into effect<lb/>
before the island is again turned over.<lb/>
In the matter of sanitation not only is<lb/>
Cuba affected, but the southern section<lb/>
of the United States is very vitally con-<lb/>
cerned in the eradication of yellow fever<lb/>
from Cuba and in the maintenance of an<lb/>
effective system of sanitation.</p>
<p>It is believed that the exposure of<lb/>
the distressing conditions in Cienfuegos<lb/>
and other places will decide the admini-<lb/>
stration to launch an even more elabor-<lb/>
ate system of sanitation in Cuba than<lb/>
had hitherto been planned. The feeling<lb/>
here is that harbor and other improve-<lb/>
ments must wait until health conditions<lb/>
are improving and another epidemic of<lb/>
yellow fever made impossible. It is<lb/>
said that sanitary conditions in Havana<lb/>
are fairly satisfactory, but this is be-<lb/>
lieved to be entirely due to the activity<lb/>
displayed by the medical officers during<lb/>
the last year, and it is realibed that no<lb/>
permanent satisfactory condition may be<lb/>
expected in Havana until a modern sys-<lb/>
tem of waterworks and sewerage is in<lb/>
operation. Whether the McGivency &amp;<lb/>
Rokeby contract will be carried out is<lb/>
as yet unsettled, but the indications<lb/>
are that this or some other contract will<lb/>
be well under way within the next year.</p>
