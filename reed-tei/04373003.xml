<p>Hench suggests that Reed's family be invited to New York University's celebration of the centennial of Reed's birth. Hench argues that Wheldon is mistaken as to the year in which Reed received a degree from New York University College of Medicine.</p>

Mr. John Whelden<lb/>
Public Relations Division<lb/>
New York University - Bellevue Medical Center<lb/>
477 First Avenue<lb/>
New York 16, New York<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Whelden:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of September 5 concerning the celebration in honor of<lb/>
Doctor Reed. I wonder if you and Doctor McEwen know that Walter Reed's<lb/>
son and daughter are living. I wonder if you had thought of having one<lb/>
of them come for the celebration. His son, Major General Walter Lawrence<lb/>
Reed, is a distinguished retired Army officer who was formerly Inspector<lb/>
General of the Army before the last war and during the last war was chairman<lb/>
of various important boards in the Army. He lives with his wife at<lb/>
2810 Thirty-Sixth Place N.W., Washington, D.C. He is quite retiring and I<lb/>
am not sure whether he would accept an invitation. Perhaps he would. He<lb/>
might like to have an excuse to go to New York. Doctor Reed's daughter,<lb/>
Mrs. Blossom Reed (Blossom was her father's favorite nickname for her and<lb/>
she has kept that name; she was married, divorced and now uses the name Reed)<lb/>
lives at Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania. She is fairly active. The<lb/>
financial circumstances of the Reeds are just adequate and therefore if you<lb/>
do invite them I think their expenses should be paid. The General of course<lb/>
has an adequate pension but the daughter lives on a small income. They are<lb/>
very nice people.</p>
<p>At the moment I can't think of an appropriate telegram to send to you but<lb/>
will probably think up one and send it as you have requested.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I personally have all of Walter Reed's diplomas. Do you have<lb/>
a photograph of his diploma from New York University College of Medicine? I<lb/>
don't believe it was called that in 1897. You say that he is an alum<del>i</del>nus of<lb/>
New York University College of Medicine, class of '97. Surely this is an error.<lb/>
Walter Reed received his first degree in medicine July 1, 1869 from the<lb/>
University of Virginia. In September 1869 he matriculated as a student of<lb/>
medicine, Bellevue Hospital Medical College. In December 1869, while attending<lb/>
medical lectures at Bellevue Medical College, he took a competitive examina-<lb/>
tion for the position of assistant physician, Infants Hospital, Randall's<lb/>
Island, New York and served in the latter capacity January 1, 1870 to April 7,<lb/>
1871. Regarding his medical career between April 1871 and February 8, 1875, see<lb/>
my published letter of February 18, 1949 to Dr. Arthur C. Jacobson in the<lb/>
Brooklyn Hospital Journal, Volume VII, 1949. Shortly after February 1875,<lb/>
Reed entered the Army. I don't understand what you can mean by the date 1897.<lb/>
I don't believe he got an honorary degree from your college. He got one from<lb/>
Harvard and one from the University of Michigan.</p>
