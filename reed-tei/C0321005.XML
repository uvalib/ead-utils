<salute>Dear Jack:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your very welcome letter of September 28th. containing news of<lb/>
your progress on editing the yellow fever manuscript reached me yester-<lb/>
day.</p>
<p>(1) <hi>Re</hi> the card for Peryass<unclear>u</unclear>: I'm sorry the reference was so in-<lb/>
volved, so am sending a white card, leaving out irrelevent matters. Yes,<lb/>
I verified the statement, or rather Dr. Harrison G. Dyar and I did so<lb/>
together in his copy of &ldquo;Os culicideos do Brazil&rdquo; (1908) P. 397.</p>
<p>(<unclear><hi>Re</hi></unclear>): <hi>Re</hi> Goeldi, (i. p.8 Father's MSS) reporting occurrence of ae-<lb/>
gypti larvae in street gutters: (a) The letter from Dr. M. E. Connor,<lb/>
which I am sending you states (last paragraph Page i) that he is cer-<lb/>
tain that Goeldi mentions aegypti breeding in <add>street</add> gutters. I have looked for<lb/>
it carefully in &ldquo;Os mosquitos no Par&aacute;&rdquo; without finding it, however, and<lb/>
although I may have overlooked it, I am generally pretty careful. (b) Also<lb/>
as you say, the fact that Howard, Dyar and Knab (p.284) quote Durham<lb/>
<del>and to the above effect</del> would make him a satisfactory substitute, <hi>althoug<add>h</add></hi><lb/>
&ldquo;rain gutters&rdquo; and &ldquo;street gutters&rdquo; are not always the same thing: all<lb/>
street gutters, <hi>in working order</hi>, can act as rain gutters, but many rain<lb/>
gutters are on on the roofs of houses and with frequent stoppage of flow by<lb/>
leaves etc, wouldn't they be more apt to encourage aegypti breeding than<lb/>
street gutters? Of course, I don't know Par<unclear>&aacute;</unclear>, and there may be no rain<lb/>
gutters save those in the streets.</p>
<p>(3) What's wrong with our friend Warren, H? I am under the im-<lb/>
pression that we read his original article and made out a verified ref.<lb/>
card for him.</p>
<p>(4) <hi>Re</hi> Nott<del>:</del><add>(</add>Josiah Clark): I am mailing you the bound vols.<lb/>
of the New Orleans Med. &amp; Surg. Journal <unclear>c</unclear>ontaining the accounts of<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0321006"/>
of<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
(a) the yellow fever epidemics of 1842 and '43 and (b) that of 1853.<lb/>
The first two epidemics Nott did not regard as contagious. That of<lb/>
1853, as you say, impressed him with the evidence of contagiousness.<lb/>
When you finish with these bound volumes, will you please send them<lb/>
back <hi>to me</hi> by insured mail, at my home address:<lb/>
The Westmoreland,<lb/>
2122 California St., N.W.<lb/>
Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>Also, I would be grateful if you would send them back at your earliest<lb/>
convenience, lest there be a call for them from the Library.</p>
<p>(c): I am also sending you Father's notes on Nott, with the paginatio<add>n</add><lb/>
I think you'll specially want indicated with <del>a</del> red pencil marks: (d) I<lb/>
am also sending Section i: Epidemiology from which your clear copy was<lb/>
made, as on pages 22 and 23 you will find the refs. to Nott's reports of<lb/>
the epidemics of 1842 &amp; '43 and (on page 23 to that of 1853). <add>also attached to this page, <unclear>verbatim</unclear> quotations from Nott <hi>re</hi> these epidemics (1842 &amp;'43 also 1853)</add> You are<lb/>
right in thinking that reference to the last as to <add>&ldquo;</add>the epidemic of 18<del>5</del><add>4</add>3<add>&rdquo;</add><lb/>
was a typographical error, but it was in <del>the</del><add>your</add> clear copy, not in the MSS<lb/>
I am sending you. The ref. on page 36 to the 1843 epidemic is correct, <add>I think,</add><lb/>
only it should be <hi>1842 and</hi> 1843.</p>
<p>I am awfully sorry for you to have so much more of the <unclear>drudgery</unclear><lb/>
of the final editing than would have <add>been</add> necessary had there <hi>only</hi> been a<lb/>
carbon of the clear copy of the book. In that case Miss Brown and I<lb/>
could have filled in everything <add>in it</add> save the few doubtful points and saved<lb/>
you a <hi>lot</hi> of work. As it is, I expect we shall have to send you the MSS<lb/>
with which we have been working, as the cards are only supplemental to<lb/>
it in the case of long verbatim quotations. I am sorry our MSS is so mark-<lb/>
ed up, but the winter I was staying in Baltimore, I understood that you<lb/>
intended to correct it before the clear copy was made, hence I inserted<lb/>
all sorts of marginal Mem. about which to ask you.</p>
<p>(5): I am also sending over to you an additional enclosure from Mr.<lb/>
<add>Van Wesep <hi>re</hi> the 2</add>nd <del>r</del><add>R</add>ef. to Carr's work at Parahyba and (5') Connor's<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fC0321007"/>
Connor's<lb/>
-3-<lb/>
verified refs., as well as his letter from which they were taken.</p>
<p>I shall be very glad to go over to Baltimore whenever you want<lb/>
me and hope that the next time I do so you <unclear><del>w</del></unclear> will let me bring Miss<lb/>
Brown <del>also</del>, as while it is my intention and expectation to &ldquo;last&rdquo;<lb/>
until I am no longer needed in connection with the book, I think it<lb/>
would be well for her to have met you &ldquo;<hi>por si acaso</hi>,&rdquo; as the Spaniards<lb/>
say--i. e. &ldquo;in case&rdquo;-- Also, I think she could the more easily explain<lb/>
any puzzling matters as to the library cards etc. if she could talk<lb/>
with you<unclear>.</unclear> Lastly, I think it would be very interesting for her to<lb/>
meet you. Miss Brown, like myself, is an early riser, so that we could<lb/>
easily get off <add>on</add> the 9 o'clok train any morning and be at your office by<lb/>
ten. Also, we could stay in <unclear>turn</unclear> over night if you needed us for longer<lb/>
than a day.</p>
<p>I am <hi>extremely</hi> glad that you suggested to Dr. Russell having<lb/>
the MSS retyped in duplicate or triplicate in Baltimore. The copies<lb/>
(mainly made for Dr. Beeuwkes<del>)</del> in <add>the</add> New York, (I. H. B.) offices in 1927<lb/>
were <hi>poor</hi>--material transposed as well as many typographical errors.<lb/>
It was very thoughtful of you to tell me about Dr. Russell being<lb/>
pleased with the progress of the work.</p>
<closer>
<salute>With love to the Susans and all manner of grateful affection to<lb/>
yourself,<lb/>
Most truly your friend,</salute>
