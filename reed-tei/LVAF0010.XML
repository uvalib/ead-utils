<salute>My Darling Sister:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here I am<lb/>
back once more in the Lord's<lb/>
Country &amp; with wife and chick,<lb/>
after a stay of many months<lb/>
in Cuba. Not a bad country<lb/>
that Cuba, if there were not<lb/>
so many Cuban's there! It<lb/>
has a great many advan=<lb/>
tages over this Climate in<lb/>
the matter of <hi>coolness</hi> in Summer<lb/>
(of course, you are surprised, but<lb/>
it is true,) and warmth in Win=<lb/>
ter! Think of <add>a</add> land where Jack<lb/>
Frost and his brother, Boreas,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fLvaf0020"/>
never show their ugly faces!<lb/>
Oh! I forgot your darling letter<lb/>
of February 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, which reached<lb/>
me in Cuba, &amp; which I am now<lb/>
trying to answer. If you wrote<lb/>
me from Lynchburg, last Summer,<lb/>
I never got it - You know, or<lb/>
probably do not, that an order,<lb/>
early last June, sent me<lb/>
right down <del>right</del> into the<lb/>
midst of yellow fever at<lb/>
Havana - Indeed I was sent<lb/>
down for the sole purpose<lb/>
of studying that disease -<lb/>
Dr. Lazear, of Baltimore, and Dr.<lb/>
Carroll, my assistant here,<lb/>
went with me - Both contrac-<lb/>
ted the disease, &amp; my dear friend<lb/>
Lazear, died of that disease!<lb/>
As for myself, I suppose<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fLvaf0030"/>
that I was hardly worth<lb/>
killing &amp; so escaped, although<lb/>
coming into the most intimate<lb/>
daily contact, <hi>but I never per-<lb/>
mitted a mosquito to bite me</hi>!!<lb/>
After much work &amp; thinking,<lb/>
I am glad to say that we have<lb/>
been able to prove conclusively<lb/>
that yellow fever is propaga-<lb/>
ted only by the bite of a certain<lb/>
kind of mosquito, provided it<lb/>
has bitten a case of yellow<lb/>
fever about 12 days before.<lb/>
My friends pronounce it a very<lb/>
great discovery and some even<lb/>
write me that, for America,<lb/>
it means more than any<lb/>
discovery for the last 100<lb/>
years! Dr. Carter, of the Marine<lb/>
Hospital Service, writes that my<lb/>
discovery makes <del>the</del><add>me one of the</add> greatest bene-<lb/>
factor that the human race has ever had!<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="fLvaf0040"/>
of course, when one has left<lb/>
wife &amp; baby, <del>and</del> faced death &amp;<lb/>
won a victory, it makes him<lb/>
happy, but it shouldn't turn his<lb/>
head - He should only thank<lb/>
God that his life hasn't been<lb/>
in vain, &amp; go on about his<lb/>
business - That's what I am<lb/>
now doing - I like that scheme<lb/>
about poultry-raising - The only<lb/>
thing that I <del>n</del>ever <add>knew</add> any thing about<lb/>
is raising chickens! I can beat<lb/>
the world at that. Why don't you<lb/>
begin in a modest way and <hi>then<lb/>
expand</hi> gradually - I do wish<lb/>
that I could run down to see<lb/>
you &amp; the babies, but my hands<lb/>
are tied on an Examining Board<lb/>
for the present - Emily &amp; our <hi>big</hi><lb/>
daughter are well &amp; would send much<lb/>
love did they know that I was writing.<lb/>
The boy is a lieutenant in the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Inf.<lb/>
Much love to Nita &amp; the others - write<lb/>
me again about that chicken scheme -</p>
