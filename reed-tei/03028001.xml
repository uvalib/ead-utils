Brig. Gen. W. C. Gorgas, U. S. Army,<lb/>
War Department,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It was very nice of Col. Kean to have called your attent-<lb/>
ion again to my work in connection with the Army Yellow-fever Commiss-<lb/>
ion and I thank you also, for the interest you may take in the matter.</p>
<p>You no doubt refer to my article published in <hi>&ldquo;The Scientific<lb/>
Monthly&rdquo;, December number</hi>, and not as you say, to the paper I read at<lb/>
the late PanAmerican Congress. <hi>If it can be done, it would please me to<lb/>
have it filed, as you suggest, in my personal records</hi>, in the War De-<lb/>
partment.</p>
<p>In preparing that history of our work, I was very careful to verify<lb/>
every statement by referring to the Military Orders, my notes, record-<lb/>
books, etc. so that the date of every event can be<add> </add>certified to, if nece<add>s-</add><lb/>
sary, as absolutely true, and you will notice that even the day of the<lb/>
week is given, in some instances: I tried very hard to eliminate the<lb/>
personal equation, in the wording as well as in the spirit of the paper,<lb/>
that it might result a clear unbiased record of what took place and why.</p>
<p>It was originally written for a magazine less scientific than the<lb/>
&ldquo;Monthly&rdquo; hence the style and the few, more or less, sentimental state-<lb/>
ments it contains, which, of course, would have been entirely out of<lb/>
place in a purely scientific exposition of our work.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03028002"/>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>There is not a single item there detailed, that cannot be proven<lb/>
by documents easily obtainable at the War Department or that are in my<lb/>
possession.</p>
<p>Now, I have no hopes of getting any special recognition either from<lb/>
the American or the Cuban Governments. All governments are ungrateful<lb/>
if not forgetful, and more praises, like prayers, are sung of the dead,<lb/>
than notice taken of the living. Inasmuch <add>as</add> I remained and made my home<lb/>
in Cuba, and an Cuban born, no doubt the Americans consider me an alien.<lb/>
On the other hand, the Cuban big bugs believe generally, that our great<lb/>
epoch-making demonstration took the wind out of Finlay's sails, that<lb/>
his glory would have been greater, and would now appear greater, if no<lb/>
mention were made of the U.S.Army Yellow fever Board, and I am de-<lb/>
fending the importance of <del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> its achievement at every opportunity,<lb/>
even in my speech, at the foot of Finlay's statue, upon the occasion<lb/>
of its unveiling.</p>
<p>Thus the matter stands, unmoved if not forgotten, and any change,<lb/>
to my benefit, would come to me as a great surprise.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, thankful,<lb/>
and very cordially,<lb/>
Yours,</salute>
