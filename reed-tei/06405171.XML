<salute>My dear Colonel Hen<del>r</del><add>c</add>h</salute>

<p>Your letter of aug. 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> '46<lb/>
has just come. It tells me of your letter<lb/>
from Mrs Kissinger, and I am distressed<lb/>
that you should be worried by her.<lb/>
The case of the Kissingers was very wide-<lb/>
ly publicized in the <unclear>1820s</unclear> largely<lb/>
through the efforts of Mr. James Edward<lb/>
Peabody, who was connected with the<lb/>
Public School system of New York City.<lb/>
He was a very earnest, ardent and per-<lb/>
haps uncritical publicist and did<lb/>
much to get public recognition for<lb/>
the volunteers for Camp Lazear experiments<lb/>
and for all others connected actively with<lb/>
Reed's work. I had a large accumulation<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06405172"/>
2-<lb/>
of the micrographic <add>and printed</add> material, that he put<lb/>
out but it has been gradually disposed<lb/>
of in one way or another. The Kissingers<lb/>
were his hobby and he organized the<lb/>
Kissinger Releif fund which bought<lb/>
them a house, a cow, 2 1&sol;2 1/2 acres of land<lb/>
and other material help accounting to<lb/>
$8,200.00. When Kissinger's original<lb/>
pension of $12 a month was raised to<lb/>
$100<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> a month, <del>he rather</del> by an error of<lb/>
the Pension Bureau <add>they</add> gave him both<lb/>
pensions for a member of years and<lb/>
then (rather meanly I thought) called<lb/>
on Kissinger to refund $1699.60 paid<lb/>
him by their negligence. Of course he<lb/>
could not do it, and his friends<lb/>
got him excused by a special act.<lb/>
The Kissingers have been the most<lb/>
successful beggars connected with the<lb/>
Reed Yellow Fever Episode and you may<lb/>

be sure that she will get every thing<lb/>
that the law allows in the way of<lb/>
funeral expenses for him and a pension<lb/>
for herself - as a veteran's widow.<lb/>
The government in generous in these<lb/>
matters, and all she has to do is<lb/>
to apply to the Veteran's Administra-<lb/>
tion in Washington, or to her Congressman<lb/>
if she prefers a political channel, to<lb/>
get it. I have no doubt that she has<lb/>
already appealed to Mr. Peabody.<lb/>
I have not heard of any appeals from<lb/>
the widows of other beneficiaries of the Act<lb/>
of Feb. 23, 1929 conferring the medals and pen-<lb/>
sions, such as Mrs Kissinger is making.<lb/>
Of course she has no claim to have Kissingers<lb/>
pension continued to her. There is an allow-<lb/>
ance for funeral expenses for veterans.<lb/>
Do not bother your head about these matters.<lb/>

You will find they have all been seen<lb/>
to by the local Veterans organizations.<lb/>
As to his illnesses having been caused by<lb/>
his experimental yellow fever attack, you<lb/>
and I know that such sequelae do not<lb/>
occur many years later as a result of yellow<lb/>
fever. The doctor who cured his paraplegia<lb/>
with medicine quite promptly, evidently<lb/>
knew the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Siler phoned me yesterday that he would<lb/>
write to you that the date of meeting of the<lb/>
Walter Reed Memorial Assn has been<lb/>
set to make it possible for you to attend<lb/>
it. It is a simple affair of 8 or 10 member<lb/>
(there are 14 in all), like a Directors meeting<lb/>
as it is, and we are much pleased at<lb/>
you going to so much trouble and expense<lb/>
to attend it. I will inclose a memo sheet<lb/>
which I have found in my papers which<lb/>
has reference to a pamphlet which Peabody<lb/>
published as I think for the use of the<lb/>

Public Schools or some such purpose.<lb/>
I have the galley proof of it in 7 galleys<lb/>
which I will send to you if you wish it.<lb/>
It states <hi>inter alia</hi> that I had recommended<lb/>
and Ireland and other high officials had<lb/>
approved <add>in 1926 </add> &ldquo;a pension of 3000 dollars <add>a year</add> for<lb/>
each of the three widows <hi>and</hi> for <hi>the Kissin-<lb/>
gers</hi>&rdquo;. This is certainly an error. My<lb/>
recommendation was made to the Senate<lb/>
Pension Committee in Jan. or Feb. 1903 that<lb/>
approximately Reed's base pay be<lb/>
continued to his widow. This was less<lb/>
than 3 months after Reed's death. I cer-<lb/>
tainly never dreamed of <unclear>recomming</unclear> such<lb/>
a pension to Kissinger. It may be that<lb/>
this galley may have been for publication<lb/>
in a magazine, but I am quite sure it was<lb/>
Peabody's, tho no name is signed to it.<lb/>

If she writes to me I will tell her that<lb/>
she is entitled to a pension as a widow<lb/>
of a Spanish War veteran and no other pension<lb/>
and that the Veterans Administration can<lb/>
inform her as to funeral expenses.</p>
<p>I will write again shortly</p>
