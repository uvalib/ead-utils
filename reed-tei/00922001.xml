<p>Prophylaxis of<lb/>
<hi>An outline for a Lecture for Public Health Institute.</hi><lb/>
Prophylaxis of Yellow Fever.</p>
<p><hi>A</hi>) <hi>Points to Emphasize:</hi></p>
<p>(1) State the Mechanism of Conveyance.</p>
<p>(2) Give the two methods of prophylaxis: Viz:--<lb/>
(a) Control of the human host,<lb/>
(b) Control of the insect host.</p>
<p>(3) Describe the first in sufficient detail to understand what is<lb/>
done--giving principles--physical and psychical on which it rests, so<lb/>
that their application can be understood.</p>
<p>(4) Compare the<del>ir</del> applicability <add>of (a) &amp; of (b) above</add> and give the indications for each one.</p>
<p>(5) Give so much of the life history of <unclear>Aedes</unclear> (Stegomyia) calopus as<lb/>
is necessary to understand the detail methods of control of the insect<lb/>
host.</p>
<p>(6) Describe control of insect host--going into some detail--giving<lb/>
special difficulties and special methods.</p>
<p>(7) Vaccination as adjuvant to campaign.</p>
<p>(8) Spontaneous elimination of yellow fever by failure of the human<lb/>
host.</p>
<p><hi>B</hi>) <hi>Mistakes to Avoid</hi>.</p>
<p>Attempting to cover the subject too closely in the time allowance<lb/>
of one lecture.</p>
<p>There are no specially good books on the Prophylaxis of Yellow Fev-</p>
<p>Insert (1)</p>
<p><hi>C)</hi> The two most important books available on this subject</p>
<p>Medicine is modeled on that in the above named &ldquo;Practice of Medicine&rdquo; <unclear>etc</unclear>.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00922002"/>
2<lb/>
etc.,<lb/>
but is even shorter. It is more available to American students.</p>
<p>The Laboratory Lecture--Yellow Fever--Supplement No. 19, to the<lb/>
Public Health Reports, although old, is possibly as good in the pro-<lb/>
phylaxis of yellow fever as either of the above books.</p>
<p><hi>D</hi>) The three or four most recent and important magazine articles<lb/>
on the subject:--</p>
<p>1/ &ldquo;Prophylaxis and Serum Therapy of Yellow Fever,&rdquo; Noguchi.<lb/>
Journal, Am. Med. Association: July 16/21.</p>
<p>2/ &ldquo;Yellow Fever in Ecuador,&rdquo; Connor.<lb/>
Journal A. M. A., March 6/21.</p>
<p>3/ &ldquo;Yellow Fever, Distribution and Control in 1920,&rdquo; Gorgas: Carter<lb/>
and Lyster.</p>
<p>Southern Med. Journal, Dec. 1920.</p>
<p>4/ &ldquo;Mechanism of <unclear>Spontaneous</unclear> Elimination of Yellow Fever by Failure<lb/>
of the Human Host.&rdquo; Carter.</p>
<p>Annals of Tropical Medicine &amp; Parisitology, (Liverpool) March<lb/>
15/20.<lb/>
Noguchi's article is--so far as prophylaxis in <unclear>concerned</unclear>--confined to<lb/>
an exposition of vaccination.</p>
<p>A Report of the Epidemic in Peru (1920)--Carter--will, I think,<lb/>
appear before May, the date of this lecture, in the Transactions of the<lb/>
Royal Society of Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene (London).</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00922003"/>
<p>Lecture for <unclear>P. H Institute</unclear></p>
<p>Malaria Control.</p>
<p><hi>A</hi>. Points to Emphasize:</p>
<p>1) State the mechanism of conveyance of malarial in nature.</p>
<p>11) State the general principle of its control, viz: to prevent the<lb/>
access of infective Anopheles mosquitoes to uninfected men.</p>
<p>The methods for carrying this out are<lb/>
(a) Get rid of Anopheles mosquitoes:<lb/>
(b) Prevent the infection of Anopheles mosquitoes:<lb/>
(c) Prevent access of Anopheles mosquitoes to men--of infective<lb/>
mosquitoes to well men and of uninfected mosquitoes to infected men.</p>
<p>A fourth method may be added (d)<lb/>
(d) So to administer quinine to men as to immunize them against<lb/>
malarial fever even when bitten by infective Anopheles.</p>
<p>This last is basically palliative only and except as it may lead<lb/>
to other measures is not to be commended for permanent control, save<lb/>
under exceptional conditions.</p>
<p>Then should follow a developement of the methods enumerated, viz:</p>
<p>Under <hi>a/</hi> get rid of Anopheles mosquitoes:<lb/>
by (1) preventing production--by control of their breeding places<lb/>
by (2) hand killing those found in residences, with, it may be, oc-<lb/>
casional fumigation in screened houses.<lb/>
by (3) removal of shelters of Anopheles near residences.</p>
<p>Under <hi>b</hi>/ Preventing the infection of Anopheles<lb/>
by (1) freeing all infected men (&ldquo;carriers&rdquo;) in the community of<lb/>
malarial parasites:<lb/>
by (2) keeping such carriers behind screens and mosquito bars at<lb/>
night--the feeding time of Anopheles.</p>
<p><unclear>"</unclear> <hi>c</hi>/ Prevent access of Anopheles to men by<lb/>
(1) keeping men behind screens and mosquito bars at night.</p>
<p><unclear>"</unclear> <hi>d</hi>/ The use of quinine to immunize against malarial attacks.</p>
<p>These subdivisions should be developed to such extent as the<lb/>
time allows when they are enunciated, laying stress on such as are<lb/>
of <add>2</add> (most general applicability and) <add>1</add> (greatest value.)</p>
<pb n="4" id="f00922004"/>
<p>applicability.<lb/>
2</p>
<p>In my opinion <hi>a</hi>/ (1) stands first in this combination, <hi>b</hi>/ (1)<lb/>
next and then <hi>c</hi>/ (1).</p>
<p>A brief statement of results and costs should be given for the<lb/>
use of the different methods and, as far as may be, the indications<lb/>
for the use of each set forth.</p>
<p><hi>B</hi>) Points to Avoid.</p>
<p>I can think of none, except attempting to cover the subject too<lb/>
much in detail and thus not keeping the proper proportion between its<lb/>
divisions. It is a large subject for one lecture.</p>
<p><hi>C</hi>) The two most important books now available on this subject:<lb/>
In my judgement these are:--<lb/>
1/ The Prevention of Malaria--by Ronald Ross--and<lb/>
2/ The First Vol. of &ldquo;The Mosquitoes of North America<unclear>&rdquo;--</unclear> Howard:<lb/>
Dyar and Knab.</p>
<p>The first is an old book--published in 1910, I believe, but I<lb/>
know of none so good.</p>
<p>The second is not new. I got it in the beginning of 1914--and<lb/>
much has been added to our knowledge of the Anopheles of the U. S.<lb/>
since that time. Yet it is a most excellent book.</p>
<p>I would say that I have not been able to do any systematic read-<lb/>
ing on this subject since the spring of 1917, at which time I took<lb/>
charge of the malaria sanitation of the Extra-Cantonment Zones, and,<lb/>
it may be, there are better newer books which I have not seen.</p>
<p>The Transactions of the National Malaria Committee of 1917<unclear>--19</unclear> &amp;<lb/>
Insert (1)</p>
<p><hi>D</hi>) The three or four most recent and important magazine articles on<lb/>
the subject.</p>
<pb n="5" id="f00922005"/>
<p>Bass's</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>work was published in 1919 in several numbers. I have not the numbers.</p>
<p>A Symposium in the American Journal of Public Health, June 1920,<lb/>
by Bass: Carter and others is well worth reading.</p>
<p>There are many articles among the Reprints: Supplements and Bul-<lb/>
letins of the Public Health Service, which are of very great value to<lb/>
the American malaria sanitarian.</p>
