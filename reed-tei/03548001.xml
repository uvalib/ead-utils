<salute>My dear <hi>Hutch:</hi></salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been so busy since my return that I haven't had a chance to write<lb/>
you. I found a lot of work waiting for me, and a medical convention, during which<lb/>
we had house guests. Then Kahler developed an acute appendix and was operated upon<lb/>
about two weeks ago, but is doing splendidly and is back home.</p>
<p>I should like to spend an evening telling you of the interesting experiences<lb/>
I had in Havana, tracing down the yellow fever story. I went down there expecting<lb/>
to investigate the story for two days, and to loaf for eight days. I thought I would<lb/>
see Moran for a few hours, visit the site of the Camp Lazear and that was all. In-<lb/>
<unclear>stead</unclear>, I got involved in quite a controversy. I soon found out that the camp site<lb/>
that has been marked by the government and where they plan to have a memorial building,<lb/>
which has been named Camp Lazear, is not the proper camp site at all. After consider-<lb/>
able work I located it a mile away. Then, I had to try to prove it, and I had several<lb/>
conferences with the Secretary of War and the Secretary of Health, with their respective<lb/>
staffs, as well as the officials of the Finlay Institute. I had to get documentary<lb/>
proof and also collected a certain amount of photographs taken by myself, others in<lb/>
the form of professional photographs, some of which I plan to offer in larger form<lb/>
for framing in the Lazear Memorial Building, should you care to have me do so. Suffice<lb/>
it to say I think I finally convinced the government officials that I was right and<lb/>
they have asked me to write the matter up, forward it to the Cuban government, and<lb/>
they will appoint a commission to determine the final site. There is a long story<lb/>
behind this that I can't bother you about now. I never worked so hard in my life,<lb/>
but I had a very interesting time.</p>
<p>I expect to see General Kean in Washington. He was Surgeon-General shortly<lb/>
after the experiments, and was directly connected with the work in Havana in 1900.<lb/>
When I get time, I will write this all up for you in a preliminary fashion and will<lb/>
of course also send the complete copy with documentary evidence to the United States<lb/>
Army Medical Museum.</p>
<p>I regret indeed that you cannot give me moral support at Lafayette, June 7.</p>
<p>Enough for now.</p>
