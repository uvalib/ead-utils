<salute>My own precious wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Mantee has<lb/>
just been to his trunk and had a &ldquo;weal&rdquo;<lb/>
nice long talk with his darlings, and<lb/>
now he is going to &ldquo;wite&rdquo; to them all<lb/>
about it- Papa wants to take back<lb/>
what he said in his last letter about<lb/>
his darling boy's picture- It is really<lb/>
much better than I thought it was-<lb/>
I find that by holding it away<lb/>
about two feet that it comes<lb/>
out much more clearly and dist-<lb/>
-inctly, and there father sees the<lb/>
sweetest little boy with the<lb/>
cutest and most cunning look<lb/>
imaginable. Papa just goes to<lb/>
his trunk, generally twice a day,<lb/>
&amp; then he takes out his darling<lb/>
wife's &amp; boy's photograph and he<lb/>
has the greatest talk with<lb/>
them you ever heard- genuine<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01747002"/>
<hi>baby-talk</hi>, and he intersperses his<lb/>
talk with many kisses for both<lb/>
of them; but most of them &amp; the <hi>swee-<lb/>
-test</hi> ones are always reserved<lb/>
for <hi>mother</hi>. For however much papa<lb/>
loves his darling Laurie (&amp; he knows<lb/>
he loves him as much as any fa-<lb/>
-ther can love a child,) yet there is<lb/>
a love for mama, for my darling<lb/>
Emilie, my own precious wife,<lb/>
my only lovie, which as far sur-<lb/>
-passes it as the day excels the<lb/>
night! And the two together <add>he loves</add>, a thous<lb/>
-and times better than his own<lb/>
life! The last <del>thing</del> <add>thought</add> at night, the<lb/>
first on the morrow, always<lb/>
is of his loved ones- There<lb/>
are so many things here to<lb/>
remind papa of mama &amp; son.<lb/>
The old house &amp; kitchen has<lb/>
a thousand sweet recollections<lb/>
The old kitchen, I must confess<lb/>
dovie, has some recollections<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01747003"/>
that are <hi>not</hi> pleasant ones-<lb/>
To think that my poor little dar-<lb/>
ling had to go into that horrid<lb/>
old kitchen &amp; work like a dog!<lb/>
Oh, I wish it had never been<lb/>
necessary; for my poor, precious<lb/>
Emilie had so many other labors<lb/>
that were sufficiently disagree-<lb/>
-able to perform, that she might<lb/>
have been spared this- But<lb/>
lovie, dear, did not your old man-<lb/>
-tee help you all he could? and<lb/>
did he not nurse you tenderly,<lb/>
faithfully when you were sick?<lb/>
And if he sometimes spoke crossly<lb/>
to you, did he not always beg his<lb/>
little wifie's pardon &amp; seal it<lb/>
with a kiss? Yes! my darling,<lb/>
you know he always hastened<lb/>
to seek forgiveness- The old &ldquo;casa<lb/>
grande&rdquo; too, often brings to my<lb/>
thoughts my darling wife and boy-<lb/>
Papa remembers how sick his<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01747004"/>
poor, sweet wifie was &amp; how pa-<lb/>
-tiently she bore it all, and remem-<lb/>
-bering this, he could never see his<lb/>
precious brought to bed again, ex-<lb/>
-cept it should be her own wish!<lb/>
Now, darling, it isnt <hi>every</hi> husband<lb/>
who is so thoughtful of his wife's<lb/>
welfare, &amp; who for her sake, would<lb/>
have made such a promise- Noth-<lb/>
-ing but love, of the purest kind,<lb/>
could cause a husband to so<lb/>
promise- But there is nothing that<lb/>
I would not do, for your comfort<lb/>
and happiness, my own pretty Em-<lb/>
-ilie! Husband would bear &amp; bear<lb/>
willingly every pain that his<lb/>
precious darling has to suffer, if<lb/>
it were possible. Although he<lb/>
occasionally <del>he</del> must have his<lb/>
joke about papa's <hi>little girl</hi>,<lb/>
mother knows that he is only<lb/>
jesting -- and she knows how good<lb/>
papa has been for a long<lb/>
time- Love your darling heart,<lb/>
there's no man loves his wife more<lb/>
than I do, &amp; who would do more for<lb/>
his precious darling than your ugly<lb/>
old mantee!<lb/>
(&ldquo;Boodigs&rdquo;!)<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01747005"/>
If papa ever takes a walk<lb/>
out past the Hospital, he thinks<lb/>
of his darling wife, who always<lb/>
<hi>would stop</hi> to gather seed from<lb/>
some wild flower<del>s</del> and mantee<lb/>
wasn't always willing to stop,<lb/>
and for this he is very sorry now-<lb/>
If he walks up &amp; down on the long<lb/>
walk in front of the quarters, he<lb/>
always thinks of mother, &amp; how<lb/>
she used to get her darling little<lb/>
(I mean <hi>big</hi>) legs &amp; petticoats all<lb/>
full of dust -- old apache dust, -- that<lb/>
always made my <del>the</del> little &ldquo;oomsey&rdquo;<lb/>
so mad. Well, the old dust is just<lb/>
as bad still, lovie, &amp; gets in old<lb/>
mantee's pants a heap, but he<lb/>
doesn't brush it out one bit-<lb/>
he just leaves it for the Pope's<lb/>
Nuncio to wrestle over- I don't<lb/>
black shoes nowadays, either, my<lb/>
lovie; nor sweep either, nor carry<lb/>
out dirty water either! &ldquo;I'se jest&rdquo;<lb/>
plays the gentleman all the time!<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01747006"/>
And what makes me so much hap-<lb/>
-pier is that my precious Emilie<lb/>
doesn't have to gather <hi>wild</hi> flowers<lb/>
now, but has the <hi>genuine domes-<lb/>
-ticated article</hi> to afford her en-<lb/>
-joyment- How you must <del>fairlly</del> <add>fairly</add><lb/>
revel in them, my lovie- Do you<lb/>
never select some sweet blossom<lb/>
&amp; wear it for poor old mantee? You<lb/>
must do so, lovie, you hear? Mantee<lb/>
would have gathered the wild<lb/>
flowers, as directed by his little<lb/>
darling, but the rains haven't<lb/>
yet descended and there isn't<lb/>
a flower to be seen anywhere.<lb/>
The ivy, darling, Mrs. Harrison<lb/>
was going to return as soon as<lb/>
I got back, but I told her to<lb/>
keep it- It sits on the front<lb/>
porch &amp; looks very beautiful- I<lb/>
always see it three times a day<lb/>
&amp; never fail to think of my lovie<lb/>
when I pass. &ldquo;Boodigs&rdquo;! Lovie!<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01747007"/>
Sunday afternoon- 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> July- The mail<lb/>
has arrived and a mighty sweet<lb/>
letter from you, my prettie lovie,<lb/>
all written across, back &amp; forth,<lb/>
and all very sweet to old mantee's<lb/>
heart- So papa's little Laurie has<lb/>
not yet forgotten the word &ldquo;papa&rdquo;:<lb/>
Love his precious little life, don't<lb/>
let him forget his own precious<lb/>
daddie, my darling wife! I tell<lb/>
you old mantee almost had<lb/>
the &ldquo;blues&rdquo; after getting your<lb/>
letter- He was so anxious to<lb/>
see his precious darlings, and<lb/>
&ldquo;finks&rdquo; its <hi>so hard</hi> to have to be<lb/>
separated from them for so long<lb/>
a time- He'll &ldquo;dit wight madsig,&rdquo;<lb/>
if they don't make haste &amp; let<lb/>
him &ldquo;tome&rdquo; East! I guess, while<lb/>
I am writing this, my little lovie<lb/>
is in Harrisonburg, and has been<lb/>
for almost a week- Oh! if old<lb/>
&ldquo;Teesigon&rdquo; was only there, <hi>what<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01747008"/>
times</hi> we could have! Romping<lb/>
about the house -- &amp; yard -- Rolling<lb/>
&amp; tumbling in the grass -- play-<lb/>
ing croquet -- eating green<lb/>
apples -- having the &ldquo;pelly&rdquo;ache--<lb/>
singing -- eating -- sleeping -- read-<lb/>
ing, and a hundred other innocent<lb/>
enjoyments! Well I don't intend<lb/>
to have the &ldquo;blues&rdquo; anyway- I<lb/>
<hi>won't have them</hi>! For I have<lb/>
got a good position, with a suf-<lb/>
-ficient salary to live comfortably,<lb/>
and the prettiest boy and the <hi>dear</hi>-<lb/>
-est, <hi>sweetest</hi>, <hi>best</hi> little <hi>wife</hi>,<lb/>
that ever man had, and I just<lb/>
intend to thank Heaven (which<lb/>
I do daily,) and be satisfied! And<lb/>
as &ldquo;oomantee&rdquo; has a husband<lb/>
who doesn't drink, gamble or<lb/>
steal, she must be satisfied too,<lb/>
&amp; not get discouraged at the<lb/>
long separation from her ugly<lb/>
old mantee- Love your life, if<lb/>
I could see you this moment, I<lb/>
would bite your darling nose <hi>clean</hi><lb/>
off -- &ldquo;you'se <hi>so</hi> feetning&rdquo;! &ldquo;Boodigs&rdquo;!<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01747009"/>
Monday morning 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. How is darling<lb/>
wifie and &ldquo;bad daddies&rdquo; this mor-<lb/>
ning! what are papa's <hi>loves</hi><lb/>
doing to pass away their time?<lb/>
Are they &ldquo;finking&rdquo; any of<lb/>
old papa way out in &ldquo;Aridonie&rdquo;?<lb/>
Did they have a pleasant journey<lb/>
from Norfolk to Harrisonburg,<lb/>
&amp; stop in Washington and have a<lb/>
peep at all the pretty things?<lb/>
what does Grandma Reed have<lb/>
to say about papa's Laurie?<lb/>
doesn't she think he is the pret-<lb/>
tiest finest boy that she ever<lb/>
saw? and doesn't little Sister<lb/>
Annie think the same? By the way,<lb/>
lovie, if Miss Annie Samuels is<lb/>
at Ma's, you must give her<lb/>
my Kindest regards- She is a<lb/>
very nice lady and very intell-<lb/>
igent- I think Ma wrote me<lb/>
that she was teaching Annie.<lb/>
Before I forget it, my darling,<lb/>
I have just read in a Tucson<lb/>
paper an account of the mar-<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01747010"/>
-riage of Rev. Mr Anderson to<lb/>
Miss Sophie Hudson -- the char-<lb/>
-ming &amp; beautiful Miss Sophie<lb/>
whom you remember as al-<lb/>
-ways being so solicitous<lb/>
about the north-east corner<lb/>
of the hem of her garment, and<lb/>
who used to gaze so intently,<lb/>
with mouth ajar, when Chap-<lb/>
-lain Nash was talking!<lb/>
They had a &ldquo;tearing&rdquo; old time, and<lb/>
&ldquo;all went merry as a marriage<lb/>
bell&rdquo; -- so the paper says- The most<lb/>
<hi>distinguished</hi> citizens of Tucson<lb/>
with their Se&ntilde;oras graced the<lb/>
scene, and after partaking of<lb/>
a &ldquo;bountiful collation,&rdquo; the hap-<lb/>
-py pair left on a bridal<lb/>
tour to Colorado. &ldquo;One by one<lb/>
the roses fade&rdquo; &amp;c- The &ldquo;belles&rdquo;<lb/>
of Tucson are gradually being<lb/>
thinned out- Miss Jannison<lb/>
will probably go next- You<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01747011"/>
astonished me by saying that<lb/>
Miss Lou U. had Uriah Jr.<lb/>
for a sweetheart! much suc-<lb/>
-cess to her! and to him too!<lb/>
And isn't Miss Nellie Vaughan<lb/>
married yet? Land alive!<lb/>
How many beaus <hi>has</hi> she had!<lb/>
I should think the old man<lb/>
would make her take a husband<lb/>
unto herself, just to get rid<lb/>
of so many well-dressed fel-<lb/>
lows lounging about the prem-<lb/>
ises! Does Miss Alice still en-<lb/>
-joy the state of &ldquo;single blessed-<lb/>
-ness&rdquo;? I'll bet five dollars that<lb/>
C. Reed, Esq- attorney at Law, will<lb/>
court that &ldquo;gal&rdquo; yet! whether<lb/>
he will get her or not I don't<lb/>
know- I think he'd stand a chance.<lb/>
The cravat and gloves came safe-<lb/>
ly to hand by yesterday's mail,<lb/>
my lovie, and I am so much<lb/>
obliged to my little Emilie for<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01747012"/>
sending them. The gloves are<lb/>
very nice &amp; give me the appear-<lb/>
-ance of quite a &ldquo;swell-&rdquo; The cra-<lb/>
vat is becoming too and gives<lb/>
me the air of considerable respec-<lb/>
-tability- It is the first one that<lb/>
I have worn since my return<lb/>
from Otero- But, lovie dear, what<lb/>
did you send me a <hi>black</hi><lb/>
cravat for? Don't you know that<lb/>
you fell in love with me<lb/>
when I was wearing a flam-<lb/>
-ing <hi>blue</hi> one! in church at<lb/>
Murfreesboro! Have you for-<lb/>
-gotten <hi>that</hi> circumstance, my<lb/>
sweet wifie? Hereafter remem-<lb/>
-ber that my favorite colors<lb/>
are a &ldquo;cerulean sky&rdquo;, a &ldquo;daz-<lb/>
-zling pink&rdquo; or a &ldquo;subdued<lb/>
solferino&rdquo;- but <hi>never</hi> a <hi>black</hi>!<lb/>
&ldquo;Boodigs&rdquo;! Eat'em up! Kiss<lb/>
me forty times, you darling wifie-<lb/>
no more until to-morrow- Have<lb/>
got to study lots of Spanish<lb/>
to-day-</p>
