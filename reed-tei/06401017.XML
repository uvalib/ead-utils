2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>

<salute>My dear Col. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your good letter of the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> gave<lb/>
me great pleasure and relieved me<lb/>
of some anxiety at having no<lb/>
news of you since your letter of<lb/>
Dec. 12. I had gotten up in the morn-<lb/>
ing with the resolution to write a<lb/>
note to Mrs. Hench to ask if you<lb/>
had been ordered away on some<lb/>
military errand, but the arrival of<lb/>
your letter in the morning mail<lb/>
made that unnecessary. Then I<lb/>
intended to send you a line or two<lb/>
at once to express my satisfaction.<lb/>
But a meeting of the T.J. Memorial Com-<lb/>
mission was called for that day<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06401018"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
2<lb/>
to arrange the numerous details for the<lb/>
dedication of the memorial on the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of April<lb/>
which is the 200<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> anniversary of Jefferson's<lb/>
birth and this took up more time than<lb/>
I expected. They called on me for informa-<lb/>
tion as to the number and addresses of<lb/>
his living descendants which no one in<lb/>
the world can give, but about which I have<lb/>
probably as much information as any one.<lb/>
But I have been occupied with a corres-<lb/>
pondence that will interest you much more<lb/>
than this. A day or two after the luncheon<lb/>
on Dec. 15. Col. Hume came to see me<lb/>
and asked if I have written out any<lb/>
thing to say on that occasion. I told him<lb/>
that I had some notes, but nothing<lb/>
that would <add>be</add> of any value &amp; gave him an<lb/>
idea of what I had had in mind to say.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06401019"/>
3<lb/>
He said he would like much to have<lb/>
it if I would write it out and I did so.<lb/>
He had it typed and sent me several<lb/>
carbons of it. One of these I am sending<lb/>
to you and you may keep it with your file.<lb/>
One I have sent to Col. Phalen saying that<lb/>
he may want to have it on file in his<lb/>
office, in case some of Gen. Gorgas's<lb/>
friends may think that the first state-<lb/>
ment in my citation trespasses somewhat<lb/>
on ground sacred to Gorgas, and this<lb/>
shows that it does not, quoting Gorgas<lb/>
's own words. It also gives his defense<lb/>
against the criticism of Reed's friends<lb/>
that Gorgas was unduly slow in<lb/>
supporting Reed's published conclusions.<lb/>
As the names signed to the citation are<lb/>
Capt. <unclear>Mann's</unclear> and Col. Phalen's as Pres. &amp; Secy<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06401020"/>
4<lb/>
of the Assn. Mil. Surgeons, they should<lb/>
have this information on file.<lb/>
NOW I want you also to see Hume's letter<lb/>
to me in order that you may understand how<lb/>
he as a Vice President of the Assn and as an<lb/>
active promoter of the whole affair and one of<lb/>
the speakers, feels about it. <hi>BUT</hi> I am<lb/>
exceedingly anxious that the criticism<lb/>
of Capt. <unclear>Mann</unclear> should not get out. So please<lb/>
do not show this letter to anyone or<lb/>
mention it. I as one of the honored<lb/>
guests do not want to be a critic<lb/>
of it. I already said more than I<lb/>
should, in my letter to you of Dec. 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
and I hope that you will not mention<lb/>
that either. I would much regret<lb/>
to have either Mr. Kellogg or Capt. <unclear>Mann</unclear><lb/>
know of this. Of course Hume was on<lb/>
a different footing and as an officer<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06401021"/>
5.<lb/>
2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
of the Assn. Mil. Surg. is at liberty to<lb/>
express an opinion, as I am not.<lb/>
So will you please return Hume's letter<lb/>
to me by return mail, as soon as you<lb/>
have read it. Every one connected with<lb/>
the whole affair has been wonderfully<lb/>
kind and good to me. Among other<lb/>
things they sent me several of the citations<lb/>
beautifully engrossed and illuminated<lb/>
and signed by the officials of the A.M. Sur-<lb/>
geons. I want you to have one but will<lb/>
send it to you at Rochester to be held<lb/>
for you there. I want you to have it in<lb/>
your collections of Y.F. manuscripts.<lb/>
You said in your letter of Dec. 12 that you<lb/>
would like to have some clippings about<lb/>
the lunch. I think I sent you one in my<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06401022"/>
6<lb/>
letter of Dec. 20 but am not sure. They<lb/>
are now out of date but I have a great<lb/>
bundle which Mr. Kellogg sent to Col<lb/>
Hume and he has passed on to me. I will<lb/>
put in two or three to show the wide<lb/>
publicity which was given to this<lb/>
occasion.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for Col. Hume as I do for you<lb/>
that his post of duty is as little adapted<lb/>
to his special gifts and liking as yours<lb/>
are in your case. He <del>is</del><add>has</add> made a special<lb/>
study of preventive medicine as applied<lb/>
to armies, and as he knows half a dozen<lb/>
languages and has acquaintances in the<lb/>
medical staffs of half the countries in<lb/>
Europe one would think his name<lb/>
would be at the top for service in Europe<lb/>
or Africa. Unfortunately he was not avail-<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06401023"/>
7.<lb/>
able when we first sent over troops, as his wife<lb/>
was in the last stage of a very painful disease<lb/>
of the nervous system and he was very con-<lb/>
siderately left on duty at the Field Medical<lb/>
School at Carlisle Bks <add>where she was in the post hospital,</add> until her death last<lb/>
Sept. His duty to his wife caused him to<lb/>
lose the chances of foreign service up to<lb/>
that time, and now he has to go to the<lb/>
bleak plains of Kansas to organize a General<lb/>
Hospital, which does not appeal to him<lb/>
at all. Mrs Kean is calling me to lunch<lb/>
so I must stop here and find an envelope<lb/>
to take this letter plus the inclosures.<lb/>
Just throw away the newspaper clippings<lb/>
I have no use for these. I hope that you<lb/>
have good reports from Mrs Hench and<lb/>
will have no trouble in getting your leave<lb/>
when her time comes. I think unless<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06401024"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
8.<lb/>
the old regulations have been changed<lb/>
your post commander can give you a week<lb/>
or ten days leave which you could get<lb/>
extended if necessary from Omaha.</p>
<p>Please give her my regards and good wishes<lb/>
in which Mrs Kean joins me.</p>
