<p>JENNIE M. CARROLL AND MABEL H. LAZEAR.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>MARCH 27, 1908.--Ordered to be printed.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Mr. MCCUMBER, from the Committee on Pensions, submitted the<lb/>
following</p>
<p>REPORT.</p>
<p>[To accompany S. 6350.]</p>
<p>This bill proposes to increase the pension of Jennie M. Carroll,<lb/>
widow of James Carroll, late major and surgeon, U. S. Army, and<lb/>
also Mabel H. Lazear, widow of Dr. Jesse W. Lazear, late acting<lb/>
assistant surgeon, U. S. Army, to $125 per month each, in special<lb/>
recognition of the eminent services of the said Maj. James Carroll<lb/>
and Dr. Jesse W. Lazear in discovering and demonstrating upon<lb/>
their own persons the truth of the theory of the transmission and<lb/>
propagation of yellow-fever infection by mosquitoes, and therefore<lb/>
by reason of such discovery and demonstration it has been made pos-<lb/>
sible to practically eliminate the scourge of yellow fever that had<lb/>
heretofore ravaged the southeastern coast of the United States and<lb/>
the West Indies Archipelago, resulting in the saving of thousands of<lb/>
lives yearly that heretofore had been sacrificed to that dread disease.</p>
<p>The officers named in the bill were appointed to serve under Maj.<lb/>
Walter Reed on a commission to investigate the yellow-fever epi-<lb/>
demics in Cuba in 1900 and 1901. Major Reed was the head of the<lb/>
commission, but his duties required him to be in Washington the<lb/>
greater part of the time, and the actual work of making the experi-<lb/>
ments and demonstrating the truth of the theory was carried on in<lb/>
Cuba by Major Carroll and Doctor Lazear. The work of that com-<lb/>
mission, headed by Major Reed, is set out in detail in Senate Docu-<lb/>
ment No. 118, Fifty-seventh Congress, second session, and is in part<lb/>
as follows:</p>
<p>The first work by Major Reed bearing on the causation of yellow fever was in 1899-<lb/>
1900, when he overthrew the claim of the distinguished bacteriologist, Sanarelli, to<lb/>
have discovered the bacillus of yellow fever, by his demonstration that the <hi rend="italic">Bacillus<lb/>
icteroides</hi> (Sanarelli) was an organism widely disseminated in this country and having<lb/>
no causative relation to that disease. He began the special work, with which his name<lb/>
will always be inseparably associated as one of the benefactors of mankind, in June,<lb/>
1900, when he went to Cuba as president of a commission to study the infectious dis-<lb/>
eases of Cuba, with special reference to yellow fever. The other members of this com-</p>
