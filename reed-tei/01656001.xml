<salute>My own, precious Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>This is<lb/>
the fourth letter I have written<lb/>
since leaving dear Murfrees-<lb/>
boro, which fact, I think, be-<lb/>
tokens my complete loyalty.<lb/>
'Tis true, my darling, they were<lb/>
short, but honest &amp; earnest<lb/>
withal, and I am sure you<lb/>
will not deny that <hi>brevity</hi> is<lb/>
a very good qualification<lb/>
for many things; even a<lb/>
letter to one's sweetheart.<lb/>
Besides, after parting with<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01656002"/>
you, my own precious darling,<lb/>
I was so homesick &amp; sad,<lb/>
that I couldn't write- I could<lb/>
only sit &amp; think, &amp; revolve in<lb/>
my mind, again &amp; again, the<lb/>
scenes &amp; events of the days<lb/>
just past, the influence of<lb/>
which hung around &amp; about<lb/>
me, like the fragrance of sweet<lb/>
flowers- Oh! how memory would<lb/>
recall the happy moments<lb/>
so quickly fled! And how<lb/>
my poor heart longed to<lb/>
live them over again! To fly<lb/>
back to the dear little parlor<lb/>
&amp; sit in the arm-chair, by your<lb/>
side, &amp; hold your darling hand<lb/>
in mine! Oh! happy hours!<lb/>
Oh! blissful moments! too quick-<lb/>
ly sped! and will they never<lb/>
return to brighten our hearts<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01656003"/>
with their radiant sunshine?<lb/>
Ah! Yes! 'tis our's to recall<lb/>
them, if we will, &amp; bid them lin-<lb/>
ger, linger still! And, Oh! my<lb/>
darling, at some near future,<lb/>
will we not summon them<lb/>
back &amp; live over again those<lb/>
blessed moments! I know we<lb/>
will! Meanwhile, e're we greet<lb/>
them again, we will cherish<lb/>
in our hearts the pleasantest<lb/>
recollections-</p>
<p>Would you believe that, for sev-<lb/>
eral days, after my return, I<lb/>
was as home-sick as ever boy<lb/>
was? I could do nothing; but<lb/>
longed to return to Murfrees-<lb/>
boro. I felt as if I must go<lb/>
back -- that I could never<lb/>
endure the separation!<lb/>
But soon the thought oc-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01656004"/>
curred to me: if you would<lb/>
avoid separation, with its<lb/>
many sorrows, lose no time<lb/>
in providing a home for this<lb/>
sweet angel, &amp; when you<lb/>
have done this, invite her to<lb/>
your heart &amp; home; so shall<lb/>
you be happy! And this will<lb/>
I do. With a brave heart, I will<lb/>
face the world &amp; its tempta-<lb/>
tions, &amp; should I faint by the<lb/>
wayside, thy prayers shall bear<lb/>
me up! Oh! my own love, let<lb/>
not your soul be troubled, lest<lb/>
I may be led away by the world!<lb/>
Oh! no! I have consecrated my life<lb/>
anew to Heaven &amp; will strive to<lb/>
lead a better life thou I have<lb/>
in days gone by: to do my duty<lb/>
as a man- And this and more<lb/>
would I cheerfully do, <hi>for your sake</hi>!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01656005"/>
When the mail arrived, this mor-<lb/>
ning, I half expected a letter<lb/>
from you, but none came. I<lb/>
will not be disappointed, however,<lb/>
for I know there is one on its<lb/>
way &amp; I can afford to wait<lb/>
a day or so longer. We are<lb/>
having the most delightful<lb/>
weather, I ever saw,- Such blue<lb/>
skies &amp; bracing air as makes<lb/>
one glad of his being alive to<lb/>
enjoy it- Such falls as you<lb/>
will only see in the Empire<lb/>
state. And yet there is a<lb/>
something indescribable, <del>but</del><lb/>
<add>the absence of</add> which the heart feels, that is<lb/>
lacking -- but which is not lack-<lb/>
ing in the dear Old North State-<lb/>
&amp; especially that part of it near<lb/>
Murfreesboro. Recalling the lat-<lb/>
ter, how truly can I say:</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Thy quiet walks are dear to me,</l>
<pb n="6" id="f01656006"/>
<l>I love thy mellow skies;</l>
<l>Thy balmy zephyr's purity</l>
<l>Bids hope &amp; courage rise.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Fain would I change my present <add>lot,</add></l>
<l>And seek thy valleys now,</l>
<l>Where I might find some quiet spot</l>
<l>To rest this weary brow.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Fain stroll besides Meherrin's stream,</l>
<l>With the fairest of thy daughters,</l>
<l>And watch the moonbeams dance &amp; gleam</l>
<l>Upon its rippling waters!</l>
</lg>
<p>But I'll cease<lb/>
my sentimentality &amp; talk of<lb/>
other matters-</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, for the<lb/>
first time since my arri-<lb/>
val at Willet's Point, I went<lb/>
to Church- To be candid, I can't<lb/>
say that I was very much<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01656007"/>
edified. The services were con-<lb/>
ducted after the form of the Epis-<lb/>
copal Church- The preacher was<lb/>
of course, rob<del>b</del>ed in his gown,<lb/>
&amp; rolled his eyes &amp; jerked him-<lb/>
self about the pulpit as<lb/>
only an Episcopal Clergymen<lb/>
can do- His sermon was<lb/>
poor &amp; delivery miserable-<lb/>
Now, I know you will tell me<lb/>
that I shouldn't go to Church<lb/>
to Criticise the preacher, &amp; I<lb/>
acknowledge the justice of<lb/>
the remark- But really, I am<lb/>
so fond of a good sermon<lb/>
&amp; good delivery, that I can't<lb/>
help criticising, when I hear<lb/>
anything so very defective-<lb/>
Of course, I only say this to<lb/>
you &amp; no one else- If I can<lb/>
bear the ordeal, I will attend<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01656008"/>
every Sunday- Perhaps, when<lb/>
I become used to him, I may<lb/>
derive some good from his<lb/>
discourses. Has my dear, good<lb/>
father left your village, yet?<lb/>
Ah! my sweet little E. you little<lb/>
know what a high place you<lb/>
occupy in his estimation- I<lb/>
received a letter from my sister,<lb/>
on Saturday, &amp; in it she told me<lb/>
how highly Pa had spoken of<lb/>
you &amp; how well pleased he was<lb/>
with our engagement- She saw<lb/>
him at Old Point in Septr &amp;<lb/>
they had a long talk concerning<lb/>
you &amp; me- So you must learn<lb/>
to love him, for my sake.</p>
<p>Remember me very kindly to Mr &amp;<lb/>
Mrs. H. &amp; your mother.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, my own darling,<lb/>
As ever, your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
