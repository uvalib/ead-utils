</head>
<p>Laura Armistead Carter transcribes a conversation between Henry Rose Carter, Thayer, and Parker, which shows how Carter's data on extrinsic incubation assisted Lazear and Reed in reaching the decision to test the theory of mosquito transmission. Carter also discusses the contributions of Finlay and others to this theory.</p>

<p>Part of a talk between Drs. Carter, Thayer &amp; Parker<lb/>
on Sunday afternoon, <hi>July</hi> <del>1914</del><add><hi>1924</hi></add>, transcribed<lb/>
from short-hand notes taken at the time.<lb/>
Carter: &ldquo;Lazear was the first one to whom I showed<lb/>
my piece.&rdquo; (on extrinsic incubation) &ldquo;That was before<lb/>
Reed came down. It was abominably printed, with<lb/>
the tables strung out in a straight line, &amp; I had to<lb/>
have an extra leaf typed &amp; stuck in, to make them<lb/>
clear, after he had read it he said: &lsquo;If these dates are<lb/>
correct, if spells a living host&rsquo;. &lsquo;possibly&rsquo; I replied &lsquo;there<lb/>
are however 3 conceivable explanations for it&rsquo;, &amp; I told<lb/>
him of the conclusion of my original article, of<lb/>
which they were the summary, but which Geddings<lb/>
had advised me to omit from the printed piece,<lb/>
for fear that they might detract from the simple<lb/>
acceptance of the data. I said:</p>
<p><unclear>1.</unclear> It may be the passage through an insect <unclear>host</unclear>,<lb/>
analogous to the passage through the tick in<lb/>
Texas cattle fever. I had not get heard of Ross's<lb/>
work on malaria.</p>

</p>
<p>Carter continuing: &ldquo;Lazear was much impressed<lb/>
&amp; asked me to write it out for him. I had taken<lb/>
the original MSS. to Cuba with me &amp; next day<lb/>
I dictated it to his man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not see Lazear for some time afterward<lb/>
when Reed came down in June, I met him in<lb/>
the quarantine launch, put him through<lb/>
customs &amp; gave him breakfast. I also gave him<lb/>
a copy of my article.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Reed again on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of July.<lb/>

Three of us went out to call on him. When he<lb/>
came in I saw that he had Lazear's reprit of<lb/>
my article in his hand, to which the memo-<lb/>
randum I had written, at his request, was attached.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Carter&rsquo;, he asked, &lsquo;can you swear to <unclear>y'r</unclear> figures&rsquo;?<lb/>
&lsquo;Better than that&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;I can bet on them!&rsquo;<lb/>
&lsquo;Then&rsquo;, said he, &lsquo;if that is so, it spells an insect host!&rsquo;<lb/>
&lsquo;not <hi>necessarily</hi>&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;have you read the memoran-<lb/>
dom I gave Lazear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not answer, owing to some interruption, but<lb/>
he still held the reprint &amp; memorandum in his<lb/>
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I then asked Reed, &lsquo;you know what Finlay says<lb/>
about it being conveyed by mosquitoes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don't tell me!&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;I want to keep a perfectly<lb/>
unbiased mind on the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! ha! Doctor!&rsquo; said Carroll to me, &lsquo;how can<lb/>
that be possible, since &lsquo;it&rsquo; (yellow fever)'s conveyed<lb/>
by bedding &amp; clothing used about the sick?&rsquo;</p>

&ldquo;&lsquo;That is so &lsquo;said Reed. &lsquo;I asked Sternberg <unclear><del>about</del></unclear><lb/>
just before I sailed &amp; he said it was universally<lb/>
admitted that yellow fever was conveyed by <unclear>formites</unclear><lb/>
&ldquo;I said: &ldquo;It is generally so admitted, but not<lb/>
universally. I for one do not believe it is I told<lb/>
him why. (Large amount of bedding &amp; clothing brought<lb/>
from Havana to New York, during a period of years<lb/>
in which there was yellow fever in the former, without<lb/>
yellow fever developing in the latter among the non-<lb/>
immune maids &amp; other non-immune personel, by<lb/>
whom it was either unpacked, or who were brought<lb/>
in contact with it. Didn't get this verbatim, as Father's<lb/>
pillow slipped, &amp; I had to get up to fix it, L.A.C.<lb/>
Carter continuing: &ldquo;Reed said then that Sternberg<lb/>
had advised him to begin his investigations<lb/>
with the intestinal flora of those dying of yellow<lb/>
fever, &amp; that he had intended so doing, but some<lb/>
time after this the experiments with mosquitoes<lb/>
were began, I carrying the first of Finlay's<lb/>

they were only kept 3 days, before biting the<lb/>

meant anything; the mosquitoes <unclear>shld</unclear> be kept<lb/>
longer before the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> biting since the &lsquo;<hi>period of<lb/>
extrinsic incubation</hi>&rsquo; had been fixed by myself<lb/>
as somewhat in excess of 10 days &amp; they <unclear>cld</unclear> not<lb/>

done &amp; justified by the results-<unclear>...</unclear></p>
