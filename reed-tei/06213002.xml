<salute>My dear Colonel Gorgas</salute>
</opener>
<p>Lieutenant Alexander<lb/>
Murray of the Med. Dept. was in the Philippines<lb/>
in 1903. His wife fell sick with pulmonary<lb/>
tuberculosis in August of that year and returned to<lb/>
the U. S. She came to New Mexico and at first lodged<lb/>
with a ranchman five miles from this Hospital.<lb/>
Her surroundings there were so unsuitable for a sick<lb/>
woman that a place was made for her here. On my<lb/>
application Lieut. Murray was relieved from duty<lb/>
in the Philippines and assigned to duty here arriving<lb/>
at this Hospital June 3d 1904, and has been on duty<lb/>
here since that date. He leaves unofficially that he<lb/>
is on the roster for Philippine duty in 1907 and it is<lb/>
of course quite possible that if there is demand for<lb/>
an increased medical force in the island that he may<lb/>
be sent over during the present year <unclear>under</unclear> these<lb/>
FILE<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06213003"/>
circumstances he has naturally given much anxious<lb/>
<unclear>the night</unclear> as to what disposition he should make of his wife.<lb/>
It will be necessary for her to remain in the Southwest<lb/>
where living expenses are high. He is dependent entirely<lb/>
upon his pay and in addition to his sick wife has<lb/>
three young children to provide for. For the reasons<lb/>
that he would receive larger pay and would be somewhat<lb/>
nearer his wife he desires to be sent to Panama rather<lb/>
than to the Philippines. He is a young man in excellent<lb/>
health, of irreproachable habits<unclear>,</unclear> of good mental ability<lb/>
and <add>is</add> a zealous and efficient medical officer. He has also<lb/>
had training in a bank and is an expert accountant.<lb/>
If there are any prospective vacancies in your force<lb/>
one of which he could fill he would be willing to<lb/>
accept the detail at any time, Lieut. Murray's case is<lb/>
<unclear>Known</unclear> to the Surgeon General, who however does not know<lb/>
of this officer's desire for Panama service. I am anxious<lb/>
to help Murray and have written this personal letter<lb/>
in advance of an official application to ask if you<lb/>
think you could do anything to further that application<lb/>
or if the conditions are such that it would be of<lb/>
no use to apply for the detail.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f06213004"/>
<p>Trusting that you will pardon me for this demand<lb/>
upon the time of a busy man I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours</salute>
