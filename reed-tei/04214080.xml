<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you for your telegram advising me of the<lb/>
proper caption for the remains of Building No. 1. I know there<lb/>
are many inaccuracies in the biographies. I discovered a number<lb/>
in quotations from letters, etc.</p>
<p>When I have a good printer's proof of the program, I shall<lb/>
send it to you. I have just made up a rough dummy, with cap-<lb/>
tions, but before putting them into print and having to pay for<lb/>
&ldquo;author's corrections&rdquo; I wonder whether you would be good enough to<lb/>
bear with me while I give you the captions and courtesy lines for the<lb/>
various data I am reproducing. If they do not seem correct to you<lb/>
in any respect, please do not hesitate to say so, for now is the time,<lb/>
before they are put into type. The program set-up will be more or<lb/>
less, as follows:<lb/>

October 15, 1927. Colonel Kean was the Chief Surgeon at the<lb/>
Army Post Hospital, Department of Havana and Pina del Rio, and<lb/>

in his experiments.</p>

<p>I regret exceedingly that this letter is not more intelligible,<lb/>
but I feel certain that you will understand what I am trying to convey to<lb/>
you. It is now nearly 7:00 P.M. and I have been out of the office nearly<lb/>
all day which accounts for the haste. I am anxious to get it off to you,<lb/>
however, so that you have it over the weekend.</p>
<p>My deepest gratitude to you.</p>
