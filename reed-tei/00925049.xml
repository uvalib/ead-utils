<salute>Dear D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carter</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just returned from<lb/>
<unclear>southern</unclear> Illinois-</p>
<p>Regarding the abstracts - on anti<lb/>
malaria work - the men in the field<lb/>
have already spoken to me of them<lb/>
and the consensus of opinion is<lb/>
that the comment as now made is<lb/>
often of more value than the abstract<lb/>
itself- They now get the value of<lb/>
the abstract where formerly it merely<lb/>
kept them guessing as to what it<lb/>
<hi>really</hi> meant- I think the abstract<lb/>
with comment is worth very much<lb/>
more to us all than the abstract without<lb/>
comment-.</p>
<p>I have got one of the new young<lb/>
I. H. B engineers Mr Rector interested in<lb/>
catch basins (street corner storm water)<lb/>
&amp; he is going into it-</p>

<p>Of course we know its not anopheles<lb/>
but if the public will not pay for malaria<lb/>
control without culex nuisance removal<lb/>
then its important- Also I am convinced<lb/>
that under proper health officers the interest<lb/>
of public in results of mosquito control can<lb/>
be used in obtaining their interest in<lb/>
control of soil pollution disease operations<lb/>
where needed- It is so being done in Alabama.</p>
<p>I just had a letter from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bert<lb/>
Caldwell (formerly Bas Obispo) - now at Vera<lb/>
Cruz &amp; vicinity- He reports about 503<lb/>
cases Y. F <del>in</del><add>for</add> Mexico 1920 &amp; 115 for 1921 - &amp;<lb/>
thinks he has the situation well in<lb/>
hand at Vera Cruz - but more work<lb/>
ahead I understood in smaller places -<lb/>
probably to north or south of V. C.</p>
<p>The State H. D of Illinois expects to<lb/>
take up malaria control in Southern<lb/>
Illinois this year &amp; is putting an engr<lb/>
in the field- Carbondale will probably<lb/>
do work &amp; possibly Murpheesboro also<lb/>
both on I. C. C-. I have been up there<lb/>
&amp; got back Sunday- There is considerable<lb/>
malaria reported-</p>
<p>The quantity &amp; prevalence of cat tail<lb/>
growth near Carbondale, Herrin, etc<lb/>
is astounding - &amp; may be quite a problem.<lb/>
<unclear>Also the</unclear> washing of slack from coal at<lb/>

coal mines silts up drainage<lb/>
channels - the water pours over the<lb/>
flat lands &amp; cat tail growth is abun<lb/>

<p>On Jan 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> at 7.05 P M at Carbondale<lb/>
Illinois in the Roberts Hotel, <add>say 100 <unclear>yds</unclear> from depot</add> I was with<lb/>
State San <add><del>H. F.</del></add> Engr <add>H F</add> Fergueson- We were having<lb/>
our shoes shined in the coat room &amp; he<lb/>
slapped his cheek &amp; said a mosquito bit<lb/>
him- A<add>bout a</add> minute later it came back<lb/>
&amp; then another - we captured the second<lb/>
&amp; it was (Stegomyia)- A search in the<lb/>
coat room showed adult Stegomyia both<lb/>
male &amp; female to be present- We captured<lb/>
(4) four with a handkerchief as we catch<lb/>
anopheles- Ive never been able to get<lb/>
stegomyia before by swatting-</p>
<p>Next morning we got several more in<lb/>
the same room- Beside Fergueson Mr<lb/>
D B <unclear>Ivenck</unclear> Asst State San. Engr and Mr<lb/>
Chandler, (State Biological Division?) were in<lb/>
the <unclear>cloak</unclear> room 8 am Jan 20 &amp; we caught some<lb/>
more stegomyia- The hall boy &amp; shoe shine<lb/>
boys who sleep in this room said they were<lb/>
bitten frequently every night- I started to run<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00925052"/>

<unclear>B28</unclear><lb/>
((4<lb/>
the breeding place down (locate it)<lb/>
but changed my mind- As Mr Chandler<lb/>
lives at Carbondale he can keep in touch<lb/>
with the situation &amp; see if they (Stegomyia)<lb/>
are yet present in Feb March &amp; up to June)<lb/>
&amp; if this is one of the ways they <del><unclear></unclear></del> can &amp; do<lb/>
pass the winter in <add>So.</add> Illinois-</p>
<p>I am sending some of the captured<lb/>
Stegomyia to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howard, Wash D. C-.<lb/>
Some of them have an absence of the<lb/>
parallel lines - they look thus<lb/>
in place of but one of those I<lb/>
gave to Mr Chandler was a perfect specimen.</p>
<p>Of course I shall let you know of<lb/>
the results-</p>
<p>I was interrupted &amp; failed to explain re<lb/>
the catch basins &amp; Mr Rector- It appears<lb/>
at Providence R. I they use a porous wall</p>
<p>A<lb/>
B</p>
<p>The water goes into compart<lb/>
ment B and slaps over into<lb/>
other chamber over division<lb/>
wall A which is porous -<lb/>
after storm subsides all<lb/>
remaining water in (B)<lb/>
leaks through porous wall<lb/>
A - &amp; leaves dry weed in<lb/>
chamber B-.</p>

&amp; Im going to get Mr Rector to run<lb/>
it down &amp; we will have it checked -<lb/>
&amp; tried out it seems possible &amp; not<lb/>
expensive-.</p>

starting in S. C-</p>

so far as practical in Alabama<lb/>

<p>It is proper to do so-</p>
