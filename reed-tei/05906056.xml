Mr. George A. Kellogg<lb/>
257 Cornelison Ave.<lb/>
Jersey City, N. J.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Kellogg:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Mrs. Lazear kindly sent me a copy of her letter to you, and I am delighted<lb/>
to see that she is so interested and plans to be so cooperative. May I hasten to ask<lb/>
you a real favor. I understand you will be making photographic copies of Mrs. Lazear's<lb/>
pictures of Dr. Lazear. Some months ago I made a similar request of her, but the re-<lb/>
quest got lost in our correspondence, and I wondered if you would please have an extra<lb/>
copy made of the photographs and let me have them. I shall be glad to pay what is<lb/>
necessary. I am also delighted at General Truby's interest, and I am sure he will be<lb/>
very helpful.</p>
<p>I have just had a letter from Dr. Agramonte's daughter, Mrs. Rodriguez-Leon.<lb/>
You will remember that she is rather bitter about the whole affair because her father<lb/>
was caught between two fires. He was more or less slighted by the Americans and con-<lb/>
sidered a traitor to Finlay by the Cubans. Nevertheless, I think you should know what<lb/>
she says about the sketches. I am therefore enclosing a copy of her letter. I am sure<lb/>
that despite her present attitude she will be glad to do what she can for you. She is<lb/>
a most intelligent and charming young woman and one very well worthy of having on one's<lb/>
side.</p>
<p>I will be leaving for Florida next Friday, and from Palm Beach to Havana on<lb/>
the twenty-first. My address will be the Villa Atlantique Hotel, Palm Beach, Florida.<lb/>
I am still a little worried that I have not yet received the various data that I gave<lb/>
you. I understood you wanted them only for a short time and would have some copied,<lb/>
merely showing Mr. Cornwell the others. If you are through with them, I would certainly<lb/>
like to have them back before leaving. Also, you haven't yet sent me a signed Osler<lb/>
painting, and I wondered whether you were able to accede to my request to have the pre-<lb/>
liminary sketches (that is, the Cuban version) photographed. As I wrote you, if you<lb/>
really want me to exhibit the actual Cuban versions, I will do so, but in view of the<lb/>
fact that you aren't planning to do much with them, I wondered whether we would be adding<lb/>
insult to injury by showing them to the Cubans and then having you come out with another<lb/>
version very shortly. I think your purposes could be served by merely giving me adequate<lb/>
representations, that is, a 5 x 7 or 8 x 10 black and white photograph of the sketches.<lb/>
I could then show these to Mr. Moran, Dr. Agramonte's daughter and others who might give<lb/>
me help regarding the uniforms, size of figures, facial expressions, etc.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
