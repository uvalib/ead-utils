<salute>My dear Doctor Carter;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was and<lb/>
still am very sorry that you<lb/>
happened to be out of town at the<lb/>
time I came to Washington last<lb/>
week. However I had to good<lb/>
fortune to meet Laura, and<lb/>
had a very pleasant and profit-<lb/>
able visit with her. I now<lb/>
realize more fully how much<lb/>
you think of her. She is truly<lb/>
a wonderful girl.</p>
<p>I presume Laura has told you<lb/>
what the object of my visist to<lb/>
Washington was, and what my<lb/>
action in the matter. I am<lb/>
still a little unsettled in my<lb/>
mind as to what might be the<lb/>
proper course to pursue. I dont<lb/>
quite see why they should still<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01002014"/>
<del>are</del><add>be</add> having difficulty in controlling<lb/>
the fever in Mexico. There may<lb/>
be some conditions which I do<lb/>
not know or understand to explain<lb/>
their trouble.</p>
<p>The plan proposed by White was<lb/>
for me to go down and take charge<lb/>
of the district of Yucatan about<lb/>
Meredia, and sort of watch the<lb/>
situation, with an eventual<lb/>
possibility of taking a more gener-<lb/>
al charge of the Mexican situation.</p>
<p>The suggestion was also made that<lb/>
there might later be some work<lb/>
in Brazil and Africa, this however<lb/>
seems a little uncertain as far as<lb/>
I am concerned. Seems like there<lb/>
is too much uncertainty in the<lb/>
policy, and I dont see much use<lb/>
of my taking one of those minor<lb/>
subordinate positions, as long<lb/>
as they have a number of Physicians<lb/>
there who have been in the work<lb/>
for some time. They would no<lb/>
doubt resent it if I should<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01002015"/>
come in a supervisory capacity.</p>
<p>It appears to me that I could take<lb/>
a hold of the Mexican proposition,<lb/>
with a few of my old staff and<lb/>
assure the finish of it in a rela-<lb/>
tively short time. However the<lb/>
longer they draw that thing out the<lb/>
more impatient the people are going<lb/>
to be and the more difficult it will<lb/>
be to finish the thing up as it<lb/>
should be.</p>
<p>I told White that I could not<lb/>
very well consider going to Mexico<lb/>
for any less than I was getting while<lb/>
in charge of the Y. F. work in Peru<lb/>
which was $1000.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> per mo. One<lb/>
has a great many unavoidable ex-<lb/>
penses for the family when one<lb/>
moves about unsettled on these<lb/>
foreign details and it is a very<lb/>
different proposition for married<lb/>
men from that of the single man<lb/>
or a married man without children.</p>
<p>There are several propositions in<lb/>
this country, some pay in about<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01002016"/>
C1<lb/>
B20<lb/>
$6000.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> per year, and if a person<lb/>
could get settled, it would pay better<lb/>
to do so; - besides it would enable<lb/>
me to do a fair amount of home<lb/>
work, which I ought to be doing<lb/>
right now in connection with<lb/>
writing up several phases of the<lb/>
work in Peru.</p>
<p>I am finding <add>it</add> rather difficult to read-<lb/>
just my self to the conditions prevailing<lb/>
and am at a loss to know what I should<lb/>
decide to do and where. We used to<lb/>
talk a great deal about Peruvian poli-<lb/>
tics - <del>but</del> there are also some politics<lb/>
right here in the U. S. A., and there<lb/>
seem to be some in the Am. Pub. H. A.<lb/>
I just attended the Cleveland meeting<lb/>
but am not sure that it paid to do so.</p>
<p>What I would like most of all if it<lb/>
were possible would be to have an<lb/>
assignment to do antimalaria and<lb/>
general field sanitary work but that<lb/>
I presume is quite out of the question.</p>
<p>The climate up here does not seem<lb/>
to agree with the children. Martha<lb/>
has just had a pretty bad cold almost<lb/>
like a flu, and Virgil is quite sick<lb/>
better to day than yesterday, but shows some<lb/>
ear trouble. Will have his ear looked at.</p>
