Generals Jefferson R. Kean and<lb/>
Albert E. Truby<lb/>
<salute>My dear Friends:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Much has happened to me since I last wrote you. Our International<lb/>
Congress was an extremely busy event for me but was a most successful affair.<lb/>
For the third time I gave our paper and we received another wonderful ovation.<lb/>
Immediately after our paper five rheumatologists from all over the country, to<lb/>
whom had been given enough cortisone (Compound E) to treat at least one or two<lb/>
patients, rose one by one and confirmed our work. Nevertheless there is much<lb/>
to be done so that we can learn how to use it properly even after the supply<lb/>
is adequate.</p>
<p>We were simply amazed by the widespread interest in our work. I had<lb/>
to under-go, with Doctor Kendall at the Congress, a press conference of 25<lb/>
newspaper writers, reporters and science writers. Several of these people<lb/>
got our reprints and with these plus the questions they asked at the conference,<lb/>
they went out and wrote <unclear>articles</unclear> about our work which you may be seeing from<lb/>
time to time. There was one in the July 23rd Saturday Evening Post, one in<lb/>
the current issue of the Ladies' Home Journal, two in Canadian magazines and<lb/>
a forthcoming one in the Woman's Home Companion, I understand.</p>
<p>I feel a great obligation to you two close friends because this will<lb/>
explain in part what I have been doing and why I have had to, from time to time,<lb/>
make my hobby subsidiary to my real job. Doctors Kendall and I have been very<lb/>
pleased to receive word that we are to be given a Lasker Award for 1949. I don't<lb/>
know much about this award but it seems to be one of the better American scien-<lb/>
tific awards.</p>
<p>After our International Congress, of which I was General Chairman,<lb/>
and which kept me extremely busy, I hurried home to get ready for 70 European<lb/>
visitors on the Post-Convention Tour. As soon as they had left, (we demon-<lb/>
strated Compound E to them, showing them on Monday morning an untreated patient,<lb/>
letting them examine the patient, treating the patient and then demonstrating<lb/>
again just two days later; they were quite impressed) I went east to a committee<lb/>
meeting regarding Compound E and immediately on my return &ldquo;blew a fuse&rdquo; which<lb/>
my wife had been expecting me to do for many months, and developed a moderately<lb/>
severe intestinal hemorrhage from an unsuspected duodenal ulcer. I have been put<lb/>
to bed, in and out of the hospital and confined to the house, dictating an hour<lb/>
a day. I am much better; however I have been ordered to rest for two months and<lb/>
am taking the whole family to the Hotel Broadmoor at Colorado Springs for three<lb/>
weeks or so. I will return in mid-September.</p>
<p>I have had two recent letters from Johnny Moran. He has interested<lb/>
himself in some movement for Miss Maas. By the way, Doctor Nogueira was at the<lb/>
International Congress. I am sorry, General Truby, that your son did not meet<lb/>
either Johnny Moran or Nogueira in Cuba. I do hope that he got around to see<lb/>
Camp Lazear. It would be tragic if he did not.</p>

<p>Generals Kean and Truby</p>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>August 16, 1949</p>
<p>The Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service asked me to<lb/>
be chairman of a research committee on rheumatic disease. I accepted. This<lb/>
will carry me to Washington probably two or three times a year. The first<lb/>
meeting is September 20 which I may have to miss but, General Kean, I shall be<lb/>
going to New York City to receive the Lasker Award on October 25 and then speak<lb/>
in Philadelphia October 31. (I have received over 40 invitations to speak during<lb/>
the next few weeks, some very wonderful ones but I am turning them all down<lb/>
except those above mentioned.)</p>
<p>Is there any chance that the Walter Reed Memorial Association meeting<lb/>
could be arranged for near November 1? I doubt if it would be wise for me to<lb/>
return to Washington three weeks later. Of course they can hold the meeting<lb/>
without me just as well.</p>
<p>I received recently a letter from Blossom Reed. Her mother almost<lb/>
died some weeks or months ago but again recovered. Blossom asked rather<lb/>
anxiously whether, after her mother's death, the fund would be made available<lb/>
to her. In answering, I could of course make no promises nor could I dis-<lb/>
tinguish between the two children, Blossom and Laurence, but I did say that I<lb/>
was sure that the Walter Reed Memorial Association would consider the care of<lb/>
Walter Reed's children much more important than the erection of any memorial<lb/>
at this time.</p>
<p>I have been asked to speak at the A.M.A. in San Francisco next<lb/>
spring and have accepted, so that I will be seeing both of you within the<lb/>
next few months.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
