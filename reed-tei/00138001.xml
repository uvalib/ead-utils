<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter with papers<lb/>
came on Thursday. I have not had<lb/>
time to read all the papers yet but<lb/>
I will get them all read up<lb/>
tomorrow I enjoy the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; very<lb/>
much. It is an excellent paper.<lb/>
It makes me feel homesick for<lb/>
New York sometimes. I notice in<lb/>
it that Johns Hopkins University is<lb/>
to get <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>58000 a year from its B &amp; C<lb/>
stock. It does not say how the deal<lb/>
was arranged. Perhaps you may<lb/>
have heard something about it,</p>
<p>I have been sticking very close<lb/>
to my work and I feel that I am<lb/>
accomplishing a great deal. Every<lb/>
moments work tells now; I have<lb/>
every advantage in the way of instruction<lb/>
specimens, &amp; apparatus, <del>I</del> and I think<lb/>
the<del>y</del> best thing I can do is to put<lb/>
every moment I have unto the work.<lb/>
There is only three weeks more of it, and<lb/>
I will then get a good rest.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00138002"/>
I don't feel the need of rest at all<lb/>
and my health is as good as<lb/>
it could possibly be.</p>
<p>When I left home I thought it<lb/>
would be better for me to return<lb/>
by the first of September and get<lb/>
some practical work in a Dispensary<lb/>
for the month of September. But<lb/>
I am beginning to think now that<lb/>
I would get more good out of<lb/>
that time, if I went to Berlin<lb/>
or some place in Germany and<lb/>
tried to perfect myself somewhat<lb/>
in German. Three weeks spent<lb/>
where I would have to commun-<lb/>
icate in that language would<lb/>
do me a great deal of good. It is<lb/>
absolutely necessary that a physician<lb/>
should be able to read German<lb/>
about as well as English.</p>
<p>I do not think I would get much<lb/>
good out of the month in New York.<lb/>
Living is cheap in Germany and<lb/>
I would really be saving money<lb/>
by staying there instead of returning<lb/>
to New York. I do not like the<lb/>
idea of prolonging my stay away from<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00138003"/>
you, but now that I am over<lb/>
here. I think it is better to get<lb/>
all the advantages, I can.</p>
<p>I wrote to you a week ago where<lb/>
to direct letters in London but<lb/>
for fear that the letter may have<lb/>
miscarried I will <unclear>repeat</unclear> it now.</p>
<p>c/o. Baring Brothers &amp; Co.<lb/>
8 Bishopsgate St. within<lb/>
London. E.C.</p>
<p>Direct as above after Tuesday July 8,<lb/>
for two weeks or up to July 22.<lb/>
After Tuesday July 22 direct to<lb/>
care of.</p>
<p>Perier fr&egrave;res et Cie.<lb/>
59. Rue de Provence<lb/>
Paris.</p>
<p>I will let you know later on<lb/>
how to direct after I leave<lb/>
Paris.</p>
<p>I have seen nothing to tell<lb/>
about for the last few days.<lb/>
I will go around and see<lb/>
the sights during the last few<lb/>
days of my stay here.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00138004"/>
I see by this morning's paper that<lb/>
there has been very hot weather<lb/>
in Chicago. I hope it has<lb/>
not been so bad at Pittsburgh<lb/>
and that you are standing it<lb/>
well and taking care of yourself.<lb/>
You have not mentioned Bedford<lb/>
lately. I wish you would go<lb/>
down there during the hot<lb/>
weather. I know it would do<lb/>
you good and make you feel<lb/>
stronger. You must do everything<lb/>
you can to keep up your strength.</p>
<p>Give my love to all. I have<lb/>
been intending for a long time<lb/>
to write to Uncle Tom but I can<lb/>
hardly find time. I will soon.</p>
<p>I got some of the &ldquo;Rock&rdquo; candy.<lb/>
It is just like cream candy. It<lb/>
is very good but no better than<lb/>
ordinary cream candy.</p>
