<p>EDITORIAL NOTE</p>
<p>&para; The attached Biography has been prepared for The National Cyclopedia of American<lb/>
Biography, and in accordance with the editorial policy, is submitted for revision, addi-<lb/>
tions and corrections.</p>
<p>&para; The National Cyclopedia has been in course of publication for more than forty years.<lb/>
It is a collection of real biographies, six hundred to five thousand words in length, con-<lb/>
taining besides the details of ancestry, education, marriage and official positions, the<lb/>
professional activities and personal achievements of the individuals with a brief history of<lb/>
the Movement, Institution or Industry with which the subject is identified. The<lb/>
published volumes have attained a high place in American literature for the authenticity<lb/>
and reliability of the information presented.</p>
<p>&para; This biography should stress the subject's life work, the account of which should be<lb/>
its chief feature. It is desired particularly to give all names in full and exact dates of all<lb/>
records. The Biography need not be limited to its present length and is subject to editorial<lb/>
revisions. Its return is requested at the earliest opportunity, even if there be no corrections.</p>
<p>The Editors.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL CYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN BIOGRAPHY</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have your letter making inquiry about two cyclopedias of American biography. The one<lb/>
issued by James T. White &amp; Co. is a reputable and standard work. It has been in course of<lb/>
publication for a long while and every few years they issue a supplementary volume. We<lb/>
take it in this library and in general we have found it valuable and accurate.&rdquo;--Harvard<lb/>
College Library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been using for many years the National Cyclopedia of American Biography and<lb/>
have in our library the first edition and also the revised edition. We find these volumes not<lb/>
only useful but necessary in our historical research work. They frequently contain sketches<lb/>
of interesting men and women not found elsewhere.&rdquo;--Librarian, Ohio State Historical Society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may say that I think the biography an amazingly excellent one -- concise, accurate and<lb/>
well balanced. It is almost incredible how your biographer was able to put together these<lb/>
salient facts, the sources of which are so widely scattered. I have no criticism whatever to<lb/>
make of it, and no important additions.&rdquo;--Willard Huntington Wright (S. S. VanDine).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Osborn's biological philosophy is carefully and rather fully analyzed in the forth-<lb/>
coming volume of the National Cyclopedia of American Biography as follows:. . .&rdquo;--From<lb/>
the Bibliography of Henry Fairfield Osborn, paleontologist and president of the American<lb/>
Museum of Natural History.--Charles Scribner's Sons, 1930.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your biographical sketch is highly satisfactory. Indeed, I am much pleased with its correct-<lb/>
ness and fairness. I was wondering where you got your facts until I discovered that you<lb/>
had seen the autobiography. &ldquo;My Heresy.&rdquo; I appreciate your painstaking care.&rdquo;--Bishop<lb/>
William M. Brown.</p>
