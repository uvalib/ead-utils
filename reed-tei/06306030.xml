WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your air mail budget came at noon today<lb/>
and is replete with interest as your letters always<lb/>
are. They take me away from the terrible history<lb/>
which is being recorded day by day with such<lb/>
startling swiftness to the pleasant memories and<lb/>
records of 40 years ago. I read Dick Bullard's<lb/>
sketch with interest and tho it differs from my<lb/>
recollections in some details I think it is quite<lb/>
accurate. I have made a marginal note or<lb/>
two on it. I think the selections for the persons in<lb/>
the picture have been very fair. I cannot see<lb/>
why Dr. Henry R. Carter should be in it. Fine and<lb/>
learned man as he was, he was not in Cuba<lb/>
during the period of the Boards' mosquito experiments<lb/>
(I know this from his daughter) and had no connec-<lb/>
tion with its work. The only connection was the<lb/>
indirect one that Reed read a magazine article<lb/>
<add>send copy to Kellogg &amp; Truby</add><lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06306031"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
2<lb/>
of his and knew how to interpret the observations<lb/>
which he reported having made that a case of<lb/>
yellow fever brought into a community does not<lb/>
product secondary cases during an interval of<lb/>
<add>(2 to 3 weeks)</add>15 or 20 days where as non-immunes visiting an<lb/>
infected house come down in 3 to 6 days<add>(1 to 7)</add> after<lb/>
exposure. These observations were made in Miss in<lb/>
1898 and it is my impression that Carter did not<lb/>
know the explanation of this curious fact until<lb/>
Reeds' Boards work furnished the clue, of this how<lb/>
ever I am not sure as I never read Carters'<lb/>
article in the A. O. Med. Jour for May 1900 in which<lb/>
the observations were published. See page 70 Senate Doc. no. 822 Yellow Fever<lb/>
As to Dr. Roger Post Ames's contributions, he look-<lb/>
ed after the sick and made diagnosis of the<lb/>
yellow fever cases, but certainly made no scientific<lb/>
contribution to the work.</p>
<p>For giving names to the other figures in the picture<lb/>
I think it would be well to take men who are<lb/>
on record in the Y.F. Roll of Honor as having under-<lb/>
gone more than one experiment as:</p>
<p>Levi E. Folk who took the Infected bedding test<lb/>
&amp; then contracted yellow fever from infected mosquitos<lb/>
James E. Hanberry. Who took both &amp; whose life<lb/>
hung in the balance from his case<lb/>
Jernegan took three tests. 1. Infected bedding<lb/>
2. Infected mosquitos (which did not infect him and<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06306032"/>
3<lb/>
then 3. a blood injection from an experimental case<lb/>
which caused all attack.</p>
<p>What do you mean by Cuban volunteers? There<lb/>
were no Cuban volunteers as the Cubans were<lb/>
always supposed to be immune. I suppose<lb/>
you refer to the Spanish immigrants. But dont you<lb/>
think it confusing to call them Cubans. Reed in<lb/>
his articles is always careful to speak of Antonio<lb/>
Benigno &amp; the others as Spanish immigrants.</p>
<p>I am so glad that you have sent a carbon copy<lb/>
of this letter to Gen. Truby. I had a letter from him<lb/>
two days ago in which he said he had not heard<lb/>
from you in a long time and feared you had not<lb/>
liked the freedom with which he expressed himself in<lb/>
his comments on the Hemmeter photostats. In my<lb/>
letter to him yesterday I assured him that it was not<lb/>
so, that your attitude of mind was entirely imperson-<lb/>
al and scientific and you only wanted the truth<lb/>
and were not taking sides. As you have already<lb/>
written it may be as well not to make any refer-<lb/>
ence to this fear of his.</p>
<p>I am pleased to be informed of Dr. Albertini's<lb/>
identification of the Mariel Group. Altho. I had<lb/>
met both Dr Dominguez Roldan &amp; Dr Hugo Roberts I do<lb/>
not recall their faces at all. My memory is poor for<lb/>
both faces &amp; names. By the way is not Dr Dominguez<lb/>
Roldan's first name <hi>Francisco</hi>? That is his signature to the<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06306033"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
4<lb/>
book and letter that I had from him last spring<lb/>
Or can it be that he has a brother named Alfredo.<lb/>
I did not recall that Dr Albertini had such a long<lb/>
neck! I am returning to you the photo, and<lb/>
Bullard's sketch. You do not mark the microfilms<lb/>
of data in the Nat. Archives as to be returned so<lb/>
I am keeping them. If you want them back a<lb/>
postal request will bring them.</p>
<p>The name of the doctor who signed various<lb/>
reports on pages 2 &amp; 3 is not <hi>Hon</hi> but Horr. Capt.<lb/>
Edward F. Horr. He was I think a Vol. Med. Officer<lb/>
who was on duty at Columbia Barracks for a short<lb/>
time. I will try to get this off by air mail tonight</p>
<p>With all good wishes</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours</salute>
