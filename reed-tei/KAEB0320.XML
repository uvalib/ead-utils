<p>Reed expresses great appreciation for Kean's recommendation that he apply himself to become Surgeon General, but says he will not join the ranks of those who &ldquo;beg&rdquo; for promotion. He informs Kean of Lawrence Reed's upcoming wedding, then recommends that Camp Lazear be discontinued.

<salute>My dear Major Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>That<lb/>
I have woefully neglected<lb/>
you goes without saying, and<lb/>
it is needless for me to add<lb/>
that I am heartily ashamed<lb/>
of myself. But really, my<lb/>
dear Commandante, when yours<lb/>
of Sept. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> came, I was so<lb/>
&ldquo;balled up&rdquo; with the work<lb/>
of the board and in trying, at<lb/>
the same time, to make ready<lb/>
a paper on &ldquo;The prevention<lb/>
of yellow fever&rdquo; which Car-<lb/>
rol &amp; I wanted to present<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fKAEB0330"/>
at Buffalo on Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, that,<lb/>
be it to my very great dis-<lb/>
credit recorded, I put aside<lb/>
your letter, after enjoying its<lb/>
contents very much, and thus<lb/>
neglected the pleasures and<lb/>
fruits of friendship for the<lb/>
every day, dry and dust<add>y</add><del>ing</del><lb/>
things of this wretched, hust-<lb/>
ling world. For all of this<lb/>
I now ask your knightly<lb/>
pardon. And now as if to<lb/>
emphasize my neglect and for-<lb/>
getfulness, here comes your<lb/>
other letter of Sept. 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, which<lb/>
touches me very, very deeply,<lb/>
Commandante mio Carrissimo.<lb/>
How shall I reply to it?<lb/>
I have even slept on it<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fKAEB0340"/>
over night and yet I don't<lb/>
know what to say. To know that<lb/>
I have your friendship and<lb/>
good wishes in such a matter<lb/>
is a real and unfeigned delight.<lb/>
I cannot thank you and other<lb/>
friends sufficiently for the kind<lb/>
words that have been written<lb/>
and spoken. These repay me<lb/>
a thousand times for anything<lb/>
that I may have done to help<lb/>
along the fight against the<lb/>
common enemy - &ldquo;pallida mors&rdquo;.<lb/>
But, my commandante mio,<lb/>
when you and others ask me<lb/>
to enter into a bitter struggle<lb/>
for the Surgeon Generalcy, you<lb/>
ask me to do what my better<lb/>
sense tells me to avoid.<lb/>
Please understand that I<lb/>
have no false modesty about<lb/>
this matter, or lack of<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="fKAEB0350"/>
ambition to reach the highest<lb/>
position in the Medical Dept.<lb/>
Like my good friend, Major<lb/>
Hoff, I believe that every one<lb/>
of us should take such inter-<lb/>
est in the welfare and good<lb/>
name of his Department as to<lb/>
wish to became its head sooner<lb/>
or later; &amp; so if I said that I<lb/>
had no such ambition, I<lb/>
would not be speaking<lb/>
candidly. Then, again, I be-<lb/>
lieve that the work accom-<lb/>
plished in Cuba, which means<lb/>
more <del>to </del><add>for</add> the health and commer-<lb/>
cial interests of our country<lb/>
than we can now estimate, <add>deserves some reward</add>.<lb/>
I believe that I speak nothing<lb/>
but the truth, when I say that<lb/>
if the man who captured Agui-<lb/>
naldo deserved a Brigadier -<lb/>
Generalcy in the line, the<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="fKAEB0360"/>
WAR DEPARTMENT,<lb/>
SURGEON GENERAL'S OFFICE,<lb/>
ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM AND LIBRARY,<lb/>
WASHINGTON.<lb/>
2) man who captured &ldquo;yellow<lb/>
Jack&rdquo; deserves a similar<lb/>
promotion, at least, in the<lb/>
staff! But I only say this<lb/>
to you as one of my best<lb/>
friends. It does not mean<lb/>
that I should enter the strug-<lb/>
gle with Brown, Smart,<lb/>
Dewitt, O'Reilly, Pope, Hoff,<lb/>
etal. Indeed to do so, would<lb/>
be utterly repulsive to my<lb/>
better feelings, for I am<lb/>
so old fashioned as to be-<lb/>
lieve that the office should<lb/>
seek the man and not the<lb/>
man be compelled to beg<lb/>
for the office. So, my dear<lb/>
Commandante, if General Wood<lb/>
who is so well able to judge,<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="fKAEB0370"/>
has spoken in a most com-<lb/>
plimentary way of the value <add>of</add><lb/>
the work done in Cuba, I<lb/>
feel profoundly grateful<lb/>
to him; but for this very<lb/>
reason, I could never go<lb/>
to him and ask him to rec-<lb/>
ommend me for promotion.<lb/>
If it came from him unsolic-<lb/>
ited, then I, like any other man,<lb/>
would feel very much flat-<lb/>
tered, but I would rather<lb/>
die a thousand deaths than<lb/>
to be put in the attitude<lb/>
of a beggar! Please don't<lb/>
misunderstand me. You must<lb/>
know that I regard Gen. Wood<lb/>
as representing the very highest<lb/>
type of the American citizen<lb/>
and that I have valued &amp; still<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="fKAEB0380"/>
value his friendship very<lb/>
highly, and am proud to reckon<lb/>
<del>myself</del><add>him</add> amongst my friends. On more<lb/>
than one occasion I have had<lb/>
reason to believe that he regards<lb/>
me highly as a friend and a<lb/>
medical officer of the Army.<lb/>
Two years ago, I begged him<lb/>
to become a candidate for<lb/>
the Surgeon Generalcy, as I<lb/>
considered him as the one man<lb/>
who could do most for our Corps;<lb/>
but it doesn't follow that he<lb/>
has an equally good opinion<lb/>
of me. If he has, then I am<lb/>
sure that, at the proper time,<lb/>
he will <del>do</del><add>so</add> express him-<lb/>
self, without any suggestion<lb/>
of mine. If he does not, then<lb/>
it would show that he prefers<lb/>
some one else. I agree with<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="fKAEB0390"/>
that his influence will be very<lb/>
great with the administration.<lb/>
Indeed, I do not doubt that he<lb/>
will select the next Surgeon<lb/>
General, and for my part, just<lb/>
so he doesn't select D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pope, I<lb/>
am certain that I shall not<lb/>
be disturbed in the least.</p>
<p>Please give much love to your<lb/>
dear wife. I cannot believe<lb/>
that she is a day over eighteen!<lb/>
What a happy man you should<lb/>
be to possess such an angelic.<lb/>
creature. Kiss the dear babies.<lb/>
You will soon receive Lawrence's Wed-<lb/>
ding Cards, as he will be married<lb/>
at Fort Reno, Okla, on Oct. 28. Mar-<lb/>
ries a Georgetown girl. Miss Black-<lb/>
ford. He is now on temporary duty at<lb/>
Fort Logan H. Root, Little Rock, Ark.<lb/>
I saw dear old Gorgas at Buffalo, and<lb/>
went on a toot with him. I see no<lb/>
reason for holding on longer to Camp<lb/>
Lazear. Send Carroll home.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Always,<lb/>
very dear Commandante, affectionately,</salute>
<signed>Reed.</signed>
