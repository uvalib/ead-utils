<p>Sacrifice of G. R. Man, Comrades for Science Unsurpassed in All<lb/>
the Annals of War; Veterans, City Prepare to Honor His Memory</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>G.R. Herald Aug 26, 1928</p>
<p>By JOHN M. KELLY</p>
<p>PRIVATE X. Y., looking down from his abode in Valhalla,<lb/>
must be smiling now as he contemplates the zeal of hero-<lb/>
admiring former comrades of Spanish war days and of a<lb/>
grateful city which soon will confer upon him a post-<lb/>
humous honor he shunned while living.</p>
<p>Private X. Y. for 26 years<lb/>
was the unknown hero of<lb/>
science's battle on yellow<lb/>
fever, the deadly curse of<lb/>
Cuba, before which had fal-<lb/>
len by the thousands brave<lb/>
men who had volunteered to<lb/>
face the Spanish bullets fol-<lb/>
lowing the sinking of the<lb/>
Maine in '98--the scourge<lb/>
which had claimed two-thirds<lb/>
of the general staff of Maj.<lb/>
Gen. Wood.</p>
<p>Private X. Y. was one of the<lb/>
heroic six who had volunteered to<lb/>
permit himself to be bitten by the<lb/>
deadly stegomyia mosquito--to offer<lb/>
his life blood as a human labora-<lb/>
tory in sacrifice to his fellow man.</p>
<p>Private X. Y., an appreciative<lb/>
government learned 27 years later,<lb/>
was Pvt. William H. Dean of Grand<lb/>
Rapids, a member of Troop B,<lb/>
United States cavalry. And Sergt.<lb/>
Dean--he was promoted before<lb/>
leaving the service--for 27 years<lb/>
had suffered in silence, uncomplain-<lb/>
ing, paying the price of an act of<lb/>
heroism that will live forever as<lb/>
one of the most dramatic epics in<lb/>
the annals of medicine.</p>
<p>Grand Rapids will dedicate to this</p>
<pb n="2" id="fn3158002"/>
<p>hero the new William H. Dean<lb/>
bridge that spans the river at Ful-<lb/>
<unclear>ton</unclear> st. But had it not been almost<lb/>
<unclear>[unclear]</unclear> accident, the story of William<lb/>
<unclear>H.</unclear> Dean's heroism would never have<lb/>
been known; he would have been<lb/>
remembered only by relatives and<lb/>
close friends as an honest work-<lb/>
ingman who struggled valiantly<lb/>
for an existence despite a heart af-<lb/>
<unclear>fliction</unclear> that caused him untold<lb/>
hours of agony and physicians' and<lb/>
hospital bills for treatment of which<lb/>
proved a constant drain upon his<lb/>
income.</p>
<p>Visualize Cuba in 1901 as de-<lb/>
scribed by Dr. Wilmer Krusen, now<lb/>
director of public health for the<lb/>
city of Philadelphia, in a magazine<lb/>
article that led to first knowledge<lb/>
after 26 years that even Dean's par-<lb/>
ents had of the deed of their son.</p>
<p>Four men, medical officers of the<lb/>
American army, Dr. Krusen wrote<lb/>
in the American magazine, were<lb/>
gathered together in Quenmados on<lb/>
a hot tropical night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were seated about a table.<lb/>
It was a grim business they were<lb/>
on. Their browned faces were grave<lb/>
and set. The Spaniards had been<lb/>
routed and cleared from the land.<lb/>
Gen. Leonard Wood and his troops<lb/>
were in possession of Cuba.</p>
<p>The Hush of Death</p>
<p>&ldquo;But though banners which<lb/>
hailed this victory of American<lb/>
arms still flaunted gaily in the<lb/>
streets of New York, and Chicago<lb/>
and San Francisco, the hush of<lb/>
Death was over Cuba, and over that<lb/>
little group in the hot room at<lb/>
Quemados.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This death was an invisible yel-<lb/>
low assassin. Passing over the<lb/>
squalor of the native slums and<lb/>
leaving them almost unscathed, it<lb/>
had descended upon the American<lb/>
quarters. Indeed, it had invaded<lb/>
the very seat of American control,<lb/>
and had taken a third of the gov-<lb/>
ernor general's staff. Every hos-<lb/>
pital bed was filled by an Ameri-<lb/>
can lad whose face and chest had<lb/>
turned to the yellow of gold and<lb/>
who writhed in delirium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yellow fever--that unsolved<lb/>
mystery of four centuries--had<lb/>
Cuba in its grip!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a month these four medi-<lb/>
cal men--Walter Reed, James Car-<lb/>
roll, Jesse W. Lazear and Aristides<lb/>
Agramonte--had been at it night<lb/>
and day, seeking a chink in the<lb/>
armor of the yellow curse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reed was the directing genius.<lb/>
He had spent 14 years at the bed-<lb/>
side of the sick on the western<lb/>
plains and mountains. He had<lb/>
doctored in New York's slums. He<lb/>
had studied disease at first hand<lb/>
and under some of the best mas-<lb/>
ters that America could boast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus far, failure had stalked<lb/>
the commission in its efforts to<lb/>
determine the cause of the disease.<lb/>
<p><hi rend="italic">Medical Society<lb/>
Pays Tribute to<lb/>
Dean's Sacrifice</hi></p>
<p>The Kent County Medical society,<lb/>
in recognition of Pvt. William H.<lb/>
Dean's sacrifice in the interest of<lb/>
humanity and science, recently took<lb/>
official cognizance of his heroism<lb/>
in the form of the following letter,<lb/>
addressed to Dean's parents:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This letter is to acquaint you<lb/>
of the recent action taken by the<lb/>
Kent County Medical society upon<lb/>
the occasion of the death of your<lb/>
son, William H. Dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His courage on the battle-field<lb/>
during the Spanish-American war,<lb/>
was only <unclear>excelled</unclear> by his supreme<lb/>
bravery at its close in offering him-<lb/>
self in the great struggle of medical<lb/>
science against a mysterious and<lb/>
fatal disease, and his name will<lb/>
be historical among those martyrs<lb/>
who have given their lives in the<lb/>
interest of humanity and for the<lb/>
advancement of science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kent County Medical so-<lb/>
ciety therefore extends to you their<lb/>
sincere sympathy for the untimely<lb/>
death of your hero kin, and as-<lb/>
sures you of their hearty approval<lb/>
of the city commission's plan to</p>
commemorate his heroic deed by<lb/>
naming in his memory the new<lb/>
Fulton street bridge, &ldquo;The William<lb/>
H. Dean Bridge,&rdquo; and furthermore,<lb/>
by official action the committee has<lb/>
been instructed to write to our local<lb/>
representatives in senate and house,<lb/>
urging that suitable recognition of<lb/>
his heroism and death be taken by<lb/>
the government of the United<lb/>
States.</p>
<p>Very sincerely,<lb/>

&ldquo;Geo. L. Bond, M. D.<unclear>,</unclear><lb/>

<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>Meanwhile Havana had been<lb/>
scoured and cleaned; its houses had<lb/>
been disinfected, its streets washed<lb/>
down and its alleys fumigated.<lb/>
Seemingly the more cleanly the<lb/>
city became, the more virulent be-<lb/>
came the scourge.</p>
<p>One Chance Left</p>
<p>&ldquo;One chance only was left, a<lb/>
chance which the whole medical<lb/>
world held in ridicule. In Havana<lb/>
there was a Cuban physician, Dr.<lb/>
Carlos Finlay. For 20 years Dr.<lb/>
Finlay had been insisting that a<lb/>
certain kind of mosquito was re-<lb/>
sponsible for yellow fever. Finlay<lb/>
had made tireless experiments to<lb/>
prove his theory, but every one of<lb/>
his experiments had failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Reed, in his study, had dis-<lb/>
covered a fact that Finlay had<lb/>
overlooked. Following a case of<lb/>
yellow fever, it was invariably two<lb/>
weeks or longer before new cases<lb/>
appeared. This indicated that the<lb/>
mosquito--if it was the carrier--<lb/>
had to go days after biting a yel-<lb/>
low fever patient before it became<lb/>
dangerous to other human beings.<lb/>
Reed believed that Finlay in his<lb/>
experiments had not given the<lb/>
mosquitoes time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So in Quemados, that hot night,<lb/>
those four medical men discussed<lb/>
mosquitoes. The task confronting<lb/>
them was to prove, as Finlay con-<lb/>
tended, that yellow fever was car-<lb/>
ried by mosquitoes only, and that,<lb/>
among all the 800 varieties of mos-<lb/>
quitoes, the stegomyia mosquito<lb/>
alone was a carrier of the disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this task, as fate would<lb/>
have it, was augmented by a hide-<lb/>
ous circumstance: Animals do not<lb/>
&lsquo;take&rsquo; yellow fever. So far as was<lb/>
known, the only living creature who<lb/>
suffered yellow fever was man!</p>
<p>Father of 5 Speaks</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reed was pale as he outlined his<lb/>
theory of Finlay's failure. It was<lb/>
Carroll, the father of five children,<lb/>
who spoke out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That means&rsquo;, he queried blunt-<lb/>
ly, &lsquo;that to prove this mosquito<lb/>
theory, somebody, a man, has to<lb/>
offer himself for experiment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reed nodded. Lazear nodded, a<lb/>
gleam in his eyes. If healthy non-<lb/>
immune men, would let themselves<lb/>
be bitten by stegomyia mosquitoes<lb/>
which two weeks or more before<lb/>
had bitten yellow fever sufferers,<lb/>
the Finlay-Reed theory would be<lb/>
proved or disproved by the result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make the experiment with-<lb/>
out flaw, at least a dozen men would<lb/>
have to be bitten!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can count on me for one&rsquo;,<lb/>
said Carroll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And on me&rsquo;, said Lazear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agramonte was immune and<lb/>
therefore useless. Reed was under<lb/>
orders to return immediately to<lb/>
Washington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The meeting broke up. In a day<lb/>
or two Reed left, and Carroll and<lb/>
Lazear began their experiments, of<lb/>
which all medical history contains<lb/>
no more heroic record.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Together with the seven men<lb/>
nameless in the records, Lazear let<lb/>
the mosquitoes suck the blood of<lb/>
his arms. The days passed.<lb/>
Strangely enough, nothing devel-<lb/>
oped. The doctor and his seven<lb/>
men remained in health. After all,<lb/>
was Reed mistaken?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You tried too soon,&rsquo; Carroll<lb/>
argued. &lsquo;Now it's my turn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He waited until almost three<lb/>
weeks had gone by. By this time,<lb/>
if Reed was right, the yellow fever<lb/>
blood in the imprisoned insects had<lb/>
ripened to deadly virulence. Carroll<lb/>
then had Lazear select the most<lb/>
dangerous looking mosquito in his<lb/>
whole collection.</p>
<p>A Sublime Act</p>
<p>&ldquo;This huge insect, brave Carroll<lb/>
let alight on his wrist, on the un-<lb/>
der part where the skin was thin<lb/>
and veins near the surface, and<lb/>
watched without a tremor as it<lb/>
drank its fill of his blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If there is anything to this<lb/>
mosquito theory,&rsquo; he wrote back to<lb/>
Reed that night, &lsquo;I should get a<lb/>
good dose of yellow fever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few days the fever was up-<lb/>
on him. Lazear and Agramonte<lb/>
stood by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Friends,&rsquo; said Dr. Carroll and<lb/>
smiled, &lsquo;this is the proudest mo-<lb/>
ment of my life. I may prove some-<lb/>
thing for humanity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make sure that it wasn't<lb/>
malaria he had, Dr. Carroll him-<lb/>
self went to the laboratory, took<lb/>
a sample of his own blood and ex-<lb/>
amined it under the microscope.<lb/>
No malaria was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning, Lazear carried<lb/>
him to the yellow fever ward, and<lb/>
there, near to death, Carroll lay for<lb/>
days. Once Lazear thought his<lb/>
heart had stopped; but Carroll's<lb/>
fine constitution rallied. Eventual-<lb/>
ly, he recovered, but a serious<lb/>
heart trouble followed as a direct<lb/>
result of the fever. He died several<lb/>
years later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Following Carroll. Private Wil-<lb/>
liam H. Dean of Grand Rapids,<lb/>
Mich., let himself be bitten by four<lb/>
mosquitoes, including the one that<lb/>
had downed Carroll. Soon he, too,<lb/>
was tossing with delirium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Lazear, as he fought for the<lb/>
lives of his charges, wasn't sure yet.<lb/>
There was a possibility, he rea-<lb/>
soned, that Carroll and Dean might<lb/>
have exposed themselves to infec-<lb/>
tion in other ways. As he pondered<lb/>
over this a mosquito of the deadly<lb/>
species alighted on his wrist. He<lb/>
was about to brush off the insect,<lb/>
when deliberately he restrained his<lb/>
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All about him were yellow fever<lb/>
patients. This mosquito was living<lb/>
among them. Lazear let the insect<lb/>
drink its fill. Four days later, to-<lb/>
ward evening, he had his first<lb/>
chill. A languor came over him, but<lb/>
he fought it back. All that night<lb/>
and on to dawn he sat at his desk,<lb/>
that he might give to the world a<lb/>
written record of his investigations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steadily he noted his symptoms.<lb/>
The task done, at last, he staggered<lb/>
weakly with the manuscript to<lb/>
Carroll, placed the paper in his<lb/>
hands, and took to his bed. He died<lb/>
at the end of the sixth day.</p>
<p>Apogee of Courage</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all the chronicles of war,<lb/>
since the first war, in all the pages<lb/>
of literature, I believe there is no</p>
