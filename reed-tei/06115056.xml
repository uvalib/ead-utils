<p>Hench informs Malloch that he is very interested in the notebook which Wood examined at the New York Academy of Medicine. He wants to know how it came to the Academy and inquires about obtaining it through inter-library loan. He believes he would be able to identify the handwriting.</p>

Dr. Archibald Mallock<lb/>
Librarian, New York Academy of Medicine<lb/>
New York City<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Mallock:</salute>
</opener>
<p>For several years I have been doing some researches on the history of<lb/>
the conquest of yellow fever by Finlay, Walter Reed and their associates.<lb/>
I have visited Havana twice and have visited or corresponded with most of<lb/>
the survivors who were associated with this work in 1900. For some time<lb/>
I have been trying to find a notebook used by Dr. Lazear in Havana in<lb/>
1900. Just recently I thought I had a good clue and that it might be in<lb/>
the hands of a certain party in Washington, D. C. Now I hear from Miss<lb/>
Laura Wood of Washington, D. C. who is writing a book on Walter Reed for<lb/>
children and whom I have been trying to help, that your library has ob-<lb/>
tained a notebook, presumably of Walter Reed, but which Miss Wood thinks<lb/>
might well be the long lost notebook of Lazear. I have collected really<lb/>
quite a large amount of unpublished material much of which is of consider-<lb/>
able historical interest and have in preparation a historical monograph<lb/>
on the subject. You can imagine my excited interest at hearing about your<lb/>
notebook. Is there any possibility that you could lend this to me as an<lb/>
inter-library loan through the Mayo Clinic Library? Unfortunately, I do<lb/>
not expect to be in New York for many months. I possess original letters<lb/>
of all of the members of the U. S. Army Yellow Fever Board and could readily,<lb/>
I think, recognize, the handwriting. If the latter were not recognizable by as<lb/>
studying the contents I think I could narrow the owner down pretty closely.<lb/>
I have studied intimately the daily activities of all connected with this work.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to lend this to me could I get a photostatic copy<lb/>
of the entire notebook? About how much would this cost? Would you kindly<lb/>
tell me the dates of the first and last entry in the notebook? Are you at<lb/>
liberty to tell me the source of the notebook, that is, who sold it to you?<lb/>
Could it have come from a man in Washington related to one of those who was<lb/>
in Havana at the time? I enclose a reprint of mine which just appeared<lb/>
and the historical significance of Lazear's notebook is indicated therein.<lb/>
I have checked mention of it in red pencil. I am extremely anxious to have<lb/>
the opportunity of studying this notebook as soon as possible and would<lb/>
greatly appreciate any courtesies which you or Miss Doe could give me.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
