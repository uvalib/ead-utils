Dr. Pedro Nogueira<lb/>
Marti 219, Marianao<lb/>
Habana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Pedro:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You and I have been trying to find out where was the cemetery in which Lazear<lb/>
and other American soldiers were temporarily buried in 1900 and so on. I<lb/>
have found a clue that may be helpful. I have discussed with General Truby<lb/>
and others the old cemetery site which you pointed out to me on one of my<lb/>
recent visits there and of which I took pictures. General Truby and others<lb/>
thought it was too far away from Camp Lazear and probably on the wrong side<lb/>
of the railroad track.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;A Report of Major General Leonard Wood, U. S. V., Commanding, Department<lb/>
of Cuba, Havana Cuba, June 30, 1901,&rdquo; I find several notes regarding the<lb/>
cemetery. In one report, on page 11, I find notes about the type of caskets<lb/>
used and in another report on page 21, I find the work of disinterment of<lb/>
American soldiers was performed between December 1, 1900 and February 24,<lb/>
1901, and the remains of 102 officers and soldiers and 66 civilians were<lb/>
carried to New York on Army transports between February 14 and March 9,<lb/>
1901.</p>
<p>But most important of all, I find, in exhibit Y entitled &ldquo;Formal Contracts<lb/>
(paid from Insular Funds) For Lands and Buildings occupied for Military<lb/>
Purposes, executed by Chief Quartermaster, Department of Cuba, during Fiscal<lb/>
Year ending June 30, 1901,&rdquo; the following note: &ldquo;Major C. B. Baker, C.Q.M.,<lb/>
Vendee; name of Contractor, Ramon Gonzalez Socorro; date of Contract, April 20,<lb/>
1901; Nature of Contract, Conveyance, Government Cemetery, Columbia Barracks;<lb/>
Consideration, $300.00.</p>
<p>I would interpret this as meaning that the land temporarily rented for the<lb/>
Army cemetery was owned by Ramon Gonzalez Socorro and if we can find a<lb/>
real estate evidence as to just where in the neighborhood of Camp Columbia<lb/>
Senor Ramon Gonzalez Socorro had property, we would know where the cemetery was.</p>
<p>I have also tried to find a complete real estate map of the land rented for<lb/>
Camp Columbia. I found an incomplete map showing the boundaries of a number<lb/>
of parcels owned by various Cubans giving exact locations and sizes, but<lb/>
parcel No. 14, which was that of the military cemetery, does not happen to<lb/>
be indicated on the maps I have.</p>

<p>Dr. Pedro Nogueira &nbsp;&nbsp; - 2 - &nbsp;&nbsp; August 21, 1954</p>
<p>I wonder if the above information is enough of a clue for you to start<lb/>
your inquiries. Next time I come I will bring this book and the in-<lb/>
complete maps, and on my return from Europe I will try to locate a com-<lb/>
plete Army &ldquo;property map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Incidentally, I think that the book I have was published not in the United<lb/>
States but in Cuba. It is bound like a Cuban book. At the bottom on<lb/>
the back of the book is the name Anson Mills, Brigadier General, U. S. A.<lb/>
and since the format and binding of this book are quite different from<lb/>
somewhat similar reports of Wood and others published in Washington, I<lb/>
am almost positive that this was published in Havana. Maybe you could<lb/>
find a copy of it in some old second-hand book stores in Havana.</p>
