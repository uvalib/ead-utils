<salute>My dear Aunt</salute>

<p>Shortly after my return from<lb/>
Baltimore I commissioned Chris. to write<lb/>
you to express my appreciation of my<lb/>
visit and that I would write you<lb/>
myself in a few days. Although two<lb/>
months have past I have come to<lb/>
the conclusion, that better late than<lb/>
never, I might avail myself of<lb/>
the leisure this place affords me.<lb/>
For the first time the entirely family<lb/>
from father to John are under<lb/>
one roof for some-weeks, and while<lb/>
the crowded condition of the house<lb/>
prevents the family reunion to the<lb/>
some extent, yet father collects the<lb/>
the boys around him for instruction &amp;<lb/>
for fishing, neither of which seem to be<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00392002"/>
successful. Poor father, had extolled the<lb/>
beauties of this place all the years that<lb/>
when things - do not go well he feels the<lb/>
responsibility of a landlord and has<lb/>
an explanation for every defect. On<lb/>
the whole we are delighted with the<lb/>
place, principally as the air is so<lb/>
pure &amp; the location healthful, as a<lb/>
nerve restorer it is about the best,<lb/>
as there is nothing exciting; ever the appear-<lb/>
ance of a white starched shirt creates<lb/>
comment. In front of the hotel thousand<lb/>
of wild ducks &amp; geese can be seen floating<lb/>
in the bay, but no one seems able<lb/>
to devise a plan to get within gunshot.<lb/>
Father contracted a severe cold before<lb/>
leaving home and is having his<lb/>
trouble in getting over it, as so many<lb/>
remedies have been suggested. which<lb/>
he can not adopt as the supply of<lb/>
patent medicine on the Island is<lb/>
very limited. Mother is some what<lb/>
relieved of her asthma, but I fear<lb/>
it has become so chronic that she<lb/>
will never be entirely free of it.<lb/>
I have no doubt Thomas has been<lb/>
supply the house with fish all summer,<lb/>
tell him one of the guests brought in<lb/>
a three found brook trout which<lb/>
was a beauty but required a day's labor<lb/>

1901<lb/>
and an expenditure of above <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>20. Ann<lb/>
and her brood leave next week<lb/>
for home greatly benefitted in body &amp;<lb/>
mind. Ann is as brown as an <unclear>indian</unclear><lb/>
and her nerves are as composed as in<lb/>
anti-<unclear>twine</unclear> days. All the children are being<lb/>
spoiled by the hotel guests. It makes><lb/>
me feel old to <unclear>sell</unclear> Alice &amp; Jane <unclear>waltzing</unclear><lb/>
<del>No</del> &ldquo;two-stepping&rdquo; with young fellows every<lb/>
night. Two noted physicians from Boston<lb/>
have been at the hotel and interested us<lb/>
in expressing their views of the noble sacri-<lb/>
fice Jesse made. Dr Bowes says that<lb/>
at the annual meeting of the Massachusetts<lb/>
medical society President Eelloit of<lb/>
Harvard addressed the society and this<lb/>
theme was the martyrdom of Dr Jesse<lb/>
W. Lazear. Dr Bowes says he believes the<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00392004"/>
AC<lb/>
L<lb/>
medical profession will some day erect a<lb/>
a monument to him at Havana, and that<lb/>
in his children's life time he will be<lb/>
known as one of the greatest scientists<lb/>
of the Country. I hope Frances has enjoyed<lb/>
her vacation and is prepared for the<lb/>
winter's work. We are looking foreward<lb/>
to the pleasure of having you with us<lb/>
this fall, and I know Chris can enter-<lb/>
tain, for she believes in making the<lb/>
relatives feel at home.</p>
