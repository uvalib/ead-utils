<salute>My own sweet Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>The let-<lb/>
ter which I awaited so pa-<lb/>
tiently, knowing that it would<lb/>
surely come, came last eve-<lb/>
ning- And after perusing it, I<lb/>
thought that it was <hi>well worth</hi><lb/>
waiting for. Was my visit like<lb/>
a &ldquo;bright dream&rdquo;? Would that I<lb/>
could add another to your<lb/>
list of happy visions! If<lb/>
my pres<del>c</del>ence can, at any<lb/>
time, afford you one happy<lb/>
hour, what would I not do<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01657002"/>
to ensure this? To know that your<lb/>
hours have passed more pleas-<lb/>
antly, &amp; that your cares, for the<lb/>
moment, have been forgotten,<lb/>
ah! this it is that makes my<lb/>
heart to beat light &amp; free!<lb/>
Your happiness, my own darling<lb/>
E., is the great aim &amp; object<lb/>
of my humble existence- Gladly<lb/>
would I sacrifice all earthly<lb/>
ambition &amp; pleasures, if by this<lb/>
means, I could make your life<lb/>
happy- For myself, for my suc-<lb/>
cess, I care nothing, save in so<lb/>
far, as it would contribute<lb/>
to your joy. And Oh! my darling,<lb/>
if I can pass through life, with<lb/>
you, a happy woman, by my<lb/>
side, I shall be satisfied -- no<lb/>
matter what the obstacles,<lb/>
what the barriers, what the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01657003"/>
reverses or trials may be!<lb/>
So that when you tell me<lb/>
that my coming is like a bright<lb/>
vision, no sweeter tidings could<lb/>
fall on my ear! To me, the week<lb/>
spent, at your dear home,<lb/>
was the brightest, happiest<lb/>
reality of my life! I delight to<lb/>
look back upon <add>it</add>, &amp; in my<lb/>
mind &amp; memory to trace each<lb/>
day &amp; live it over again!<lb/>
And when each pleasant<lb/>
scene has passed in review,<lb/>
I put them back into my heart,<lb/>
each in its place, &amp; think, what-<lb/>
ever <add>else</add> may happen, these can<lb/>
never be taken from me!<lb/>
Nay! not only shall they re-<lb/>
main, but others, as bright<lb/>
&amp; pleasant, many, many others<lb/>
shall be added to them!<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01657004"/>
If it lies within my power,<lb/>
not many months will pass<lb/>
over my head, before I shall<lb/>
again look into your dar-<lb/>
ling face. From intelligence<lb/>
that has reached me, since<lb/>
my return, I will not be or-<lb/>
dered away from Willet's Point<lb/>
till next Spring; and such<lb/>
being the case, what would,<lb/>
what <hi>could</hi>, prevent me from<lb/>
appearing in the Old North<lb/>
State, about next February<lb/>
or March? Remember, my<lb/>
precious, that this is only rum-<lb/>
or, &amp; may not be true; and yet<lb/>
I place considerable confi-<lb/>
dence in it. I hope, by Nov.<lb/>
1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> to know more definitely,<lb/>
when I will lose no time<lb/>
in sending you words-<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01657005"/>
And, now, my darling, little<lb/>
Sweetheart, there is a matter<lb/>
concerning which I desire<lb/>
to ask your advice- Do<lb/>
not, please, refuse to lend an<lb/>
attentive ear, as I know you<lb/>
will not, &amp; to tell me just what<lb/>
you think of the matter- Don't<lb/>
say that you are not entitled<lb/>
to a hearing, because I consider<lb/>
that you have a right to know<lb/>
of all my plans &amp; underta-<lb/>
kings.</p>
<p>The matters, which I desire to<lb/>
speak of, is this. My Sister is<lb/>
very anxious that her little<lb/>
daughters, &amp; especially her<lb/>
oldest, Anita, should go to<lb/>
Murfreesboro, next February, &amp;<lb/>
she has written me a long,<lb/>
&amp; sweet letter, asking me<lb/>
to assume the pecuniary re-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01657006"/>
sponsibility of her education,<lb/>
till such time as she may<lb/>
graduate; provided I consid-<lb/>
er myself able to do so. Her<lb/>
husband, being enrolled in<lb/>
the category of Methodist Preach-<lb/>
ers, out of his abundance, is<lb/>
not able to educate all of his<lb/>
children, &amp; hence Sis seeks her<lb/>
brother's assistance. What shall<lb/>
I do, my darling? Shall I not<lb/>
respond? Is there a better<lb/>
deed that I can do, than to<lb/>
educate my own Sister's<lb/>
daughter? Could anything speak<lb/>
more forcibly to my heart than<lb/>
this request from a darling<lb/>
sister? Tis true that my<lb/>
means are limited, yet can<lb/>
I, can <hi>we</hi>, not spare a few<lb/>
hundred dollars towards the<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01657007"/>
education of this dear child?<lb/>
I have not answered her letter<lb/>
yet, but, with your consent,<lb/>
I will write &amp; take upon<lb/>
myself the responsibility of<lb/>
her expenses at Murfreesboro.<lb/>
Let me know, my precious,<lb/>
just what you think of the<lb/>
plan I propose, and do not<lb/>
hesitate to state your opin-<lb/>
ion &amp; wishes fully- I shall<lb/>
gladly listen to anything you<lb/>
may have to say, &amp; shall feel<lb/>
that whatever course you<lb/>
endorse is the right one-<lb/>
Bless your darling heart, I<lb/>
never propose to embark<lb/>
into any undertaking, with-<lb/>
out first seeking <hi>your</hi><lb/>
advice &amp; approval, which<lb/>
I value more highly than all<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01657008"/>
that others may have to say.<lb/>
Before closing my letter, one<lb/>
thing I will say <del>bef</del>e're it<lb/>
escapes my memory -- I refer<lb/>
to my address. Hereafter, my<lb/>
darling, please direct your<lb/>
letters, Whitestone Post Of-<lb/>
fice, Willet's Point, N.Y. Harbor-<lb/>
Very often the Post Master or<lb/>
Mail Agent makes the mistake<lb/>
of sending my letters to Flushing<lb/>
instead of Whitestone, &amp; hence<lb/>
<del>my letters</del><add>they</add> are detained two or<lb/>
three days- Your last, which<lb/>
I should have received on Mon-<lb/>
day, did not reach me till Wednes-<lb/>
day night,- &amp; thus, I was kept two<lb/>
days &amp; night from its precious<lb/>
contents.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Adieu, my darling,<lb/>
Believe me, as ever,<lb/>
Your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
