<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> is very interesting and<lb/>
I am really terribly sorry that I won't have the <unclear>privilge</unclear><lb/>
of meeting you and the others at W &amp; J but my<lb/>
duties here as Health Officer make it impossible for me<lb/>
to come- I was much interested to know that you now<lb/>
located one of the experimental buildings and am<del><unclear></unclear></del><lb/>
trying to remember the details you ask for- The location<lb/>
of the <unclear>stove</unclear> I think was on the left as you enter<lb/>
and as I recall, the roof was the ordinary type<lb/>
(triangular) with a moderate angle- I think Agramontes<lb/>
drawing is substantially correct - The details didnt make<lb/>
much impression on me at the time and its been a<lb/>
long time ago. I do recall that I slept on the cot<lb/>
to the right of the door and I think there was only one window<lb/>

but am not certain. There was no fence around the camp<lb/>
as I remember but the buildings were enclosed.<lb/>
The inside construction was tongue and groove I am<lb/>
fairly certain. I am sorry to say I have no <unclear>[?]</unclear><lb/>
of the buildings as of those at Columbia Bks.<lb/>
I have a <unclear>letter</unclear> from Agramonte written about 1902<lb/>
enclosing articles dealing with phases of Reeds<lb/>
work and his part in it which I will gladly<lb/>
send you if you would care to see them.</p>
<p>It would give me real pleasure <unclear>doctor</unclear> to meet<lb/>
you should you be in Virginia at any time-<lb/>
I ought to be able to remember more <unclear>details</unclear> of <unclear>this</unclear> ex<lb/>
perience I don't <unclear>think</unclear> we had much idea, at the time<lb/>
that anyone would be particularly interested. I dont think<lb/>
there was a ceiling to the room in bldg 1 just rafters but<lb/>
of this I am not certain, wishing I could be of more help<lb/>
in recalling what you want to know and with cordial<lb/>
regards</p>
