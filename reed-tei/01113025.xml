<p>Connor discusses his paper on yellow fever, including the use of scrubbed versus unscrubbed water barrels. He believes that the areas of North and Central America should be considered one unit because of modern transportation.</p>

<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your memorandum and my MSS. arrived<lb/>
here two days ago.</p>
<p>a. I am going to answer your questions<lb/>
by numbers: Memo. page 2 par.5- I understand that<lb/>
the aedes egypti are to be found in certain sections<lb/>
of M&eacute;xico city where the people are conserving their<lb/>
water in receptacles in the home, in these places they<lb/>
are fairly numerous. A case of yellow fever was<lb/>
imported into Mexico City in 1921, the case was<lb/>
still in the infective period but no further devolopments<lb/>
were noted. Dr. Scannell had not received your letter up<lb/>
to the time he left here.</p>
<p>b. From memorandum marked &ldquo;For Dr. Connor<lb/>
(To accompany MSS) page 2-8:P <unclear>2:&rdquo;</unclear> by &lsquo;cycle period&rsquo;<lb/>
I was trying to express the observation that an area<lb/>
or better still a region will more likly experience an<lb/>
invasion of yellow fever after a free interval of many<lb/>
years than if the comunity had been more recently<lb/>
infected., for instance P&aacute;nuco reported its last case<lb/>
of yellow fever previous to the epidemic of last year,<lb/>
in 1903. The interval from 1903 to 1922 had seemingly been<lb/>
free of the infection and therefore the city had a large<lb/>
non-immune population (native). Now, it seems to me that <unclear>i</unclear><lb/>
if we had in mind the fact that from the time of the<lb/>
last case of yellow fever (reported) 1903 to 1921 when<lb/>
the first cases began to appear in Tampico that P&aacute;nuco, due<lb/>
solely to the natural increase of its population, was<lb/>
easily infected territory that work would have been<lb/>
undertaken there. Yellow fever literature does not call<lb/>
attention to this observation in a forceful way and I<lb/>
am trying to express the thought.</p>
<p>c. page 3-16: P: <unclear>4:&rdquo;</unclear> True, many inmigrants come<lb/>
to friends and many of these friends live in stegomyiae<lb/>
free homes or all members of these home may be immunes.<lb/>
In Guayaquil I personally followed the arrivals into that<lb/>
city as the infection lessened and about 80% of new<lb/>
arrivals sought and found lodging in the cheap boarding<lb/>
houses. In bringing out such points would you not consider<lb/>
that a service is being made in pointing out that phase<lb/>
of a factor which if not stressed might be overlooked <add>and<lb/>
possibly lead to fatal</add> results?</p>
<p>page 4- par.19: P: 6' We have some expe-<lb/>
riements underway in <unclear>Vuaghansarea</unclear> to note the difference<lb/>

in the barrels of the rate of aedes egypti<lb/>
breeding, first where the barrels have been<lb/>
scrubbed and second in barrels not so treated.<lb/>
It seems to me that if this mosquito does de-<lb/>
posit her eggs above the water line as a regular<lb/>
procedure that there should be a marked diffe-<lb/>
rence in the containers reported having larvae<lb/>
that have been scrubbed.</p>
<p>page 4- par. 20: P.: 6' My understanding<lb/>
of the term &lsquo;sporadic&rsquo; is a case of a disease<lb/>
appearing at irregular intervals without any<lb/>
known preceeding case of the same infection<lb/>
in the community, in other words only infections,<lb/>
the causative organism of which maintains its vitality<lb/>
in the human host and may or may not give rise in<lb/>
the &lsquo;carrier&rsquo; to the symptom-complex attributed to<lb/>
the particular organism or may not become active until<lb/>
transferred to another person, the resulting illness<lb/>
is spoken of as a &lsquo;sporadic case&rsquo;. The reason<lb/>
that I emphasized the point that there can be no<lb/>
'sporadic case of yellow fever in the MSS. is for<lb/>
the sole purpose of bringing this fact home to<lb/>
the Mexican physician, the majority of whom &lsquo;love&rsquo;<lb/>
the term and use it whenever convienent. I feel that<lb/>
our efforts here will be more successful if we<lb/>
correct certain false impressions which the average<lb/>
physician here entertains regarding yellow fever.,<lb/>
than if we leave him to continue the old ideas.<lb/>
One good result of our articles on yellow fever and<lb/>
the campaign has been <add><unclear>that</unclear></add> more physicians/to-day in<lb/>
Mexico are reading up than ever before and the reason<lb/>
for this is that we have upset some of their old<lb/>
theories and in their efforts to prove that their<lb/>
ideas were right and ours wrong they have been obliged<lb/>
to read and then they see the light, this explains<lb/>
why I have stressed &lsquo;ssporadic case&rsquo;</p>
<p>Page 4- par.21-P-6' My thought here is<lb/>
that the aedes egypti infested areas of North America<lb/>
and Central America especially, must be considered as<lb/>
one unit in the control of yellow fever due to the<lb/>
excellent means of communications, land, water and air<lb/>
The air traffic is not generally as yet but is beco-<lb/>
ming more so each day and if we neglect to keep posted<lb/>
on the conditions in Central Ameriaca it would be<lb/>
possible to have a focus of infection there from<lb/>
which the disease could pass later into Mexico and be<lb/>
the nucleus of an epidemic, this assuming of course<lb/>
that the present campaign had termitated.</p>
<p>Thanking you for your generous and frank<lb/>
criticism of my MSS,</p>

<salute>I am, very sincerely yours.</salute>
