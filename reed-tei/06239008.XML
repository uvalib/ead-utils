Dr. Aristides Agramonte,<lb/>
Calle K, Entre 15 Y 17,<lb/>
Vedado, Habana, Cuba.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of August 4th was duly received and I was glad to<lb/>
hear from you. With regard to the republication of the Reed papers,<lb/>
I am very sorry that the publication of one of yours was not included.<lb/>
This collection was made and edited by Capt. Love, one of the Surgeon<lb/>
General's assistants, and although he consulted me about it I am afraid<lb/>
I did not give the matter as much attention as I should have or I would<lb/>
have seen to it that the statement made in the former memorandum from<lb/>
the office as to your share in the work was offset by an extract from<lb/>
your letter to the Surgeon General, <hi>which is on file here</hi>. I was very<lb/>
much occupied, however, by other matters and it was not brought to my<lb/>
attention. I think if we had had on file any of your own publications<lb/>
that Capt. Love would have put them in, but Capt. Love tells me that<lb/>
he did not find any separate paper of yours in our files. If you have<lb/>
copies of such I would be glad to have you sent them so that we shall<lb/>
have them for reference and for future use in case of republication.<lb/>
There really seems to be a fatality about your getting a proper state-<lb/>
ment of your share in this work clearly before the public, though of<lb/>
course your name appears in all the publications of the board and you<lb/>
will observe that we have not failed to include your photograph with<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06239009"/>
K 2.<lb/>
the others. When the time comes, however, for a monument to Walter Reed I<lb/>
will see, if I am alive, that full justice is done you and I have put your<lb/>
letter on file in connection with the publications.</p>
<p>I am going to sail on Sept. 30th on the White Star Line &ldquo;Olympic&rdquo; for<lb/>
Paris to attend the Sanitary Conference which was originally called for the<lb/>
26th of May. I understood that you were to be one of the Cuban representa-<lb/>
tives and I hope to meet you in Paris, that is, unless you can manage to go<lb/>
on the Olympic. Please sit down on the receipt of this letter and let me<lb/>
know by return mail if you are going and, if so, where I will find you.<lb/>
You should certainly be there to help see that proper action is taken with<lb/>
regard to yellow fever. Please let me know what other representatives, if<lb/>
any, will come from Cuba.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>(sgd) J.R.K.</signed>
Lieut.-Colonel, Medical Corps, U.S.A.<lb/>
