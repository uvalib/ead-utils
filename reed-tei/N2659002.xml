<p>MOSQUITO CONTROL<lb/>
ENDS FATAL PLAGUE<lb/>
OF YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Dr. Walter Reed Who Served<lb/>
as Brooklyn Health Officer<lb/>
Found Carrier of Germ.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>By H. B. MAUER.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great pestilence of Virginia&rdquo;<lb/>
as it is historically known, was the<lb/>
yellow fever plague, which almost<lb/>
wiped out the entire population of<lb/>
Portsmouth and Norfolk in 1855--a<lb/>
time of general consternation, sud-<lb/>
den death and hasty burials. Thou-<lb/>
sands fled from their loved<unclear>,</unclear> peaceful<lb/>
and previously happy and healthy<lb/>
homes to escape a scourge which<lb/>
annihilated whole families in the<lb/>
palatial mansion as well as the<lb/>
humblest hut. As compared with<lb/>
the great scourage of London, with<lb/>
its 100,000 fatalities, the ratio being<lb/>
one death to seventeen survivors<unclear>,</unclear><lb/>
<unclear>the</unclear> death loss in Portsmouth and<lb/>
<unclear>Norfolk</unclear> was one in three.</p>
<p>Omitting all harrowing details,<lb/>
<unclear>this</unclear> brief reference to Virginia's<lb/>
<unclear>plague</unclear>, it might be said that a de-<lb/>
<unclear>scription</unclear> of it would be a descrip-<lb/>
<unclear>tion</unclear> of the 90 other plagues which<lb/>
had invaded the United States; one<lb/>
in 1793 which took 10 percent of<lb/>
Philadelphia's population: that of<lb/>
New Orleans in <unclear>1853</unclear> with its 8,000<lb/>
fatalities and with others in that<lb/>
year which caused a loss of $15,335,-<lb/>
000, when a dollar meant some-<lb/>
thing; those of Memphis, Charles-<lb/>
ton, Galveston, Baltimore and New<lb/>
York even and the most outstand-<lb/>
ing of them all, Panama, where De<lb/>
<unclear>Lesseps</unclear> lost 22,000 of his men. The<lb/>
<unclear>purpose</unclear> of this recital, however, is<lb/>
to throw out in bold relief the<lb/>
transcendentally splendid services of<lb/>
Walter Reed and his colleagues.</p>
<p>On the western hemisphere, at<lb/>
least<unclear>,</unclear> no longer does yellow fever lay<lb/>
its victims low by thousands or to<lb/>
any extent, for it has all but passed<lb/>
into history and to Walter Reed,<lb/>
more than to any other, is the credit<lb/>
due for that colossal achievement.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Health Official.</p>
<p>Walter Reed was born at <unclear>Belroi,<lb/>
Gloucester</unclear> County, Virginia, on<lb/>
<unclear>13, 1851</unclear>. He began the study<lb/>
<unclear>of medicine</unclear> at the University of<lb/>
<unclear>Virginia</unclear>, graduating as an M. D. at<lb/>
<unclear>the age</unclear> of 17. A second degree was<lb/>
<unclear>rred</unclear> upon him by the Bellevue<lb/>
<unclear>Medical</unclear> College of the City of New<lb/>
<unclear>after</unclear> which he served in the<lb/>
Brooklyn City Hospital and on<lb/>
Blackwell's Island, now called Wel-<lb/>
fare Island. Before he was 21 he<lb/>
was a district physician in New<lb/>
York City and at 22 was one of the<lb/>
health inspectors of the Board of<lb/>
Health of Brooklyn. He entered the<lb/>
army as an assistant surgeon in<lb/>
1875, ranking as first lieutenant, and<lb/>
served in Arizona, Nebraska, Dakota<lb/>
and in southern and western states.<lb/>
In 1893 he was promoted surgeon<lb/>
with the rank of major, when he<lb/>
was detailed in Washington as<lb/>
curator of the Army Medical Mu-<lb/>
seum and professor of Bacteriology<lb/>
in the Army Medical School.</p>
<p>During the Spanish - American<lb/>
War, when yellow fever spread de-<lb/>
vastation among American troops,<lb/>
he was selected as the head of a<lb/>
board to study the causes and<lb/>
spread of the disease and afterwards<lb/>
was sent to Cuba for the same pur-<lb/>
pose. With him three other army<lb/>
surgeons were associated, James<lb/>
Carroll, Jesse W. Lazear and Aris-<lb/>
tides Agramonte, who constituted a<lb/>
Yellow Fever Commission.</p>
<p>About this time much work was<lb/>
done by the American authorities<lb/>
to diminish disease and mortality<lb/>
in Cuba, and while these operations<lb/>
produced a marked improvement<lb/>
along some lines, they had no effect<lb/>
whatever on yellow fever. It was<lb/>
now that Reed suspected that the<lb/>
transmission of the disease was due<lb/>
to an insect, since all well estab-<lb/>
lished sanitary measures proved<lb/>
futile.</p>
<p>In <unclear>1881</unclear>, Dr. Carlos <unclear>Finley</unclear>, of<lb/>
Havana, advanced the theory that<lb/>
a mosquito was the essential agent<lb/>
for yellow fever transmission and<lb/>
this claim now engaged the atten-<lb/>
tion of Walter Reed. He also at<lb/>
the same time effectually set at<lb/>
rest another generally accepted<lb/>
theory.</p>
<p>Supplies with ample funds to con-<lb/>
duct experiments and volunteers<lb/>
offering themselves <unclear>aplenty</unclear> from<lb/>
among the American soldiers, this<lb/>
experimentation now proceeded.</p>
<p>The first tests were negative. Men<lb/>
of sound health were placed in beds<lb/>
in which yellow fever patients had<lb/>
died, without change of bedding;<lb/>
they were clothed in unlaundered<lb/>
garments which such victims had<lb/>
worn and ate from their dishes, un-<lb/>
washed; in fact, every possible test<lb/>
was employed and no yellow fever<lb/>
resulted. After exhausting every<lb/>
possible means along these lines,<lb/>
the experimenters were convinced<lb/>
that yellow fever was not a con-<lb/>
tagious disease. Positive tests were<lb/>
now made by resorting to the mos-<lb/>
quito transmission theory, but the<lb/>
tests were first made on the mem-<lb/>
bers of the <unclear>commission</unclear> themselves<lb/>
since they <unclear>were</unclear> firmly convinced<lb/>
that the means now to be <unclear>employed</unclear><lb/>
would produce the expected results,<lb/>
they would not place the health and<lb/>
lives of others in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll allowed himself to<lb/>
be bitten by a mosquito which was<lb/>
known to have previously bitten a<lb/>
yellow fever patient and the disease<lb/>
resulted. He recovered, however, and<lb/>
then Dr. Lazear made a like experi-<lb/>
ment. At first, no ill effects came of<lb/>
this, but a subsequent test proved<lb/>
fatal and Dr. Lazear died. There<lb/>
is a tablet placed to his memory<lb/>
in the Johns Hopkins Hospital at<lb/>
Baltimore, the inscription of which<lb/>
was composed by Dr. Eliot, presi-<lb/>
dent of Harvard University.</p>
<p>Many more experiments were<lb/>
made chiefly on American soldiers,<lb/>
who had first, however, been made<lb/>
cognizant of Lazear's fate but this<lb/>
did not deter them and on one<lb/>
occasion, when two of these <unclear>humble</unclear><lb/>
obscure heroes presented themselves.<lb/>
Kissinger and Moran by name, and<lb/>
insisted that they would submit to<lb/>
the tests for the good of humanity<lb/>
and the advancement of science<unclear>,</unclear><lb/>
and disdained to take the <unclear>$200</unclear><lb/>
reward offered, as did also every<lb/>
other volunteer, Major Reed said:<lb/>
&ldquo;Gentlemen, I salute you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed's claims were now so well<lb/>
established that they received uni-<lb/>
versal acceptance and thereafter all<lb/>
efforts to stamp out yellow fever<lb/>
were directed toward the mosquito,<lb/>
scientifically known as stegomyia<lb/>
calipus and whose guilt was beyond</p>
