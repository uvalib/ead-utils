<salute>Dear Doctor:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter received<lb/>
some few days ago and all so<lb/>
the beautiful book, whitch<lb/>
I appreciate very highly words<lb/>
could not express my thanks</p>
<p>I have neglected writing<lb/>
this season as you mentioned<lb/>
my picture at the tub help-<lb/>
-ing my wife. Dr Kelly Mr.<lb/>
Kissinger being so Nervious he<lb/>
Insists on my finishing this<lb/>
letter. he has been rather slow<lb/>
to respond but we were short<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02926004"/>
2<lb/>
of money It <unclear>hinched us</unclear> but<lb/>
we found a Gentleman with a<lb/>
camera he called at the House<lb/>
took one in wheel chair one at<lb/>
the tub after Seeing Mr. Kissinger<lb/>
condition he only charged him <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>1.00<lb/>
Mr. Kissinger <unclear>I sent</unclear> as well as<lb/>
he was for a while and the Dr.<lb/>
has forbidden him to do a thing<lb/>
he has helped all that was in<lb/>
his Power to do but It been but<lb/>
little the Dr Said he was loosing<lb/>
in Vitality. but our circumstances<lb/>
<unclear>madke</unclear>. It nessary for us to work.<lb/>
and he is so Nervious he will<lb/>
not sit by and watch me work.<lb/>
without trying to help. his Dr.<lb/>
Is E. K Dean and Is doing all he<lb/>
can for Mr. Kissinger. I will enclose<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02926005"/>
3<lb/>
one of the Dr Cards- the Photo<lb/>
was returned to us we received<lb/>
It today but did not get your<lb/>
Photo, but would be very glad<lb/>
to get one; Mr. Kissinger thinks<lb/>
lots of the Book you sent and<lb/>
says you have done splendid in<lb/>
getting the Details as well as you<lb/>
have of Dr. Major Reeds experiment<lb/>
for yellow fever: and expresses<lb/>
his Sorrow that Major Reed had<lb/>
to give up his life just when he<lb/>
should Reaped the Reward, from his<lb/>
Great Work: he had done.-<lb/>
Mr. Kissinger has been somewhat<lb/>
disapoited, he was in hope to<lb/>
get some Pension that he could<lb/>
go away to Hot Springs or some<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02926006"/>
4<lb/>
Place for a change of climate<lb/>
thinking that might Improve his<lb/>
health Congressman Brick. took<lb/>
the matter up through Mr. Kissinger<lb/>
friends here and Put bill in<lb/>
Congress for <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>.50 but It dropped to<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>12. the last we heard of it and<lb/>
was yet to have the Presidents Sig-<lb/>
nature so we have heard nothing<lb/>
further from It Mr. Kissinger<lb/>
has been very backward about applying<lb/>
for a Pension as he had offerd<lb/>
himself for the experiment and felt<lb/>
as though. People would think he<lb/>
wanted to Reap a benefit from<lb/>
It. he would like to have John<lb/>
J. Moran's Address: if you have<lb/>
It I do washings for others and<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02926007"/>
5<lb/>
Its a very hard way and a slow<lb/>
way but an Honest way of making<lb/>
money my Hands are so stiff from<lb/>
having them in water so much<lb/>
you must excuse this writing</p>
<p>Wishing to hear from you<lb/>
when convenient and thanking<lb/>
you for the Interest you have<lb/>
shown will bid you Goodnight</p>
