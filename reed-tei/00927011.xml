<salute>My dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am returning, enclosed, your notes on the<lb/>
efficacy of vaccination against yellow fever, which<lb/>
answered my question as fully and precisely as questions<lb/>
are always answered by you. I am very much obliged<lb/>
to you for remembering and taking the trouble to send<lb/>
me the notes.</p>
<p>Under separate cover I am returning to you<lb/>
your copy of the Scientific Monthly containing the ar-<lb/>
ticle &ldquo;Adventures in Stupidity&rdquo; which is most enter-<lb/>
taining and I think instructive.</p>
<p>I am indebted to you again for your copy of<lb/>
the report on pneumonia in Panama which I will return<lb/>
to you later, after I have taken advantage of your per-<lb/>
mission to have it copied. Three points in the report<lb/>
are of very special interest to me, the association of<lb/>
influenza with the pneumonia epidemic, the high prevalence<lb/>
of pneumonia among the new-comers which corresponds<lb/>
exactly to the experience reported by Opie, Freeman, et al<lb/>
at Camp Funston and Camp Pike in 1918, and finally the<lb/>
fact that the two periods of highest prevalence of<lb/>
pneumonia in August-September, 1906 and March-April, 1907<lb/>
are separated by an interval of approximately eight months,<lb/>
which is very interesting and suggestive in connection<lb/>
with Brownlee's observation upon the tendency of influ-<lb/>
enza epidemics to recur at intervals or multiples of eight<lb/>
months (33 weeks). It seems to me that we are accumulat-<lb/>
ing considerable evidence (as you would say, &ldquo;not proof&rdquo;)<lb/>
that <hi>epidemics</hi> of pneumonia are apt to be, perhaps always,<lb/>
associated with epidemics of influenza, which may be un-<lb/>
recognized or at least unreported. I wish you would pub-<lb/>
lish your Panama report, or at least a note giving its<lb/>

Dr. Carter<lb/>

substance for I think the observations are of real value.</p>
<p>I cannot adequately thank you for your three lec-<lb/>
tures which were a delight to all who heard them, and<lb/>
which, with all due respect to other lecturers, were easily<lb/>
the best lectures that we have had here. The check for<lb/>
your small honorarium should be received within a week or<lb/>
two. I am sorry that it will hardly more than pay your<lb/>
traveling expenses, and hope that you will <del>think</del><add>understand</add> that it<lb/>
does not in any sense measure our appreciation of your<lb/>
lectures.</p>
<p>With sincere regards to yourself and Miss Carter,<lb/>
and hoping that we may see something of both of you in<lb/>
the future,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
