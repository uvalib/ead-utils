Miss Mary A. Benjamin<lb/>
c/o Walter R. Benjamin<lb/>
655 Fifth Avenue<lb/>
New York, New York<lb/>
<salute>My dear Miss Benjamin:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Through the years I have had considerable satisfaction<lb/>
from practically everything I ever bought from you. However,<lb/>
in 1939 I slipped. I bought from you the collection of letters of<lb/>
&ldquo;famous scientists, chemists, writers, et cetera&rdquo; written in connection<lb/>
with Madam Curie's visit to America. Regarding this collection, <unclear>see</unclear><lb/>
the enclosed letter. (Will you kindly return the letter to me?)<lb/>
Although I had some doubts in my mind at the time, I bought the letters<lb/>
almost exclusively in order to get the one or two Curie items which<lb/>
were therein. Each time I looked over my collection, I found this bunch<lb/>
of letters which have never interested me in the slightest and which,<lb/>
as the years passed, I found more annoying. They may be of some value<lb/>
to somebody, but they are of no interest to me. I have been tempted<lb/>
to throw them away, but realized that what may not interest me may be<lb/>
of interest to someone else. I am therefore returning them all to you<lb/>
and you can do any one of the following things with them. 1. Throw<lb/>
them away if they are of no value to anyone. 2. Give them to someone<lb/>
with my compliments if you know anyone who really wants them. 3. Accept<lb/>
them and sell them for what they are worth and either (a) keep the<lb/>
entire proceeds for yourself with my compliments or (b) apply on my<lb/>
account whatever token payment or value those letters might have if<lb/>
you were to buy them from a stranger now. If, without the Curie items,<lb/>
these letters are really worth anything and you want them, I am glad<lb/>
to let you have them and I have every confidence in the way you will<lb/>
handle the matter.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
