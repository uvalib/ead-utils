<hi>COPY FOR COL. TRUBY</hi><lb/>
FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
Draft only, submitted for signature of Secretary of War - March 18, 1932.<lb/>
Re <hi>Pinto</hi><lb/>
<dateline>
WAR DEPARTMENT<lb/>
Washington<lb/>
</dateline>
Honorable David A. Reed,<lb/>
Chairman, Committee on Military Affairs,<lb/>
United States Senate,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Senator:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Careful consideration has been given to the Senate bill No. 206,<lb/>
Seventy-second Congress, first session, &ldquo;to recognize the high public<lb/>
service rendered by <hi>Doctor A. S. Pinto</hi>, and the bravery displayed by him<lb/>
in connection with the discovery of the cause and means of transmission<lb/>
of yellow fever,&rdquo; upon which the views of the War Department were re-<lb/>
quested by your indorsement of reference dated February 24, 1932.</p>
<p>By act of Congress approved February 28, 1929, the Secretary of<lb/>
War is authorized and directed &ldquo;In special recognition of the high pub-<lb/>
lic services rendered and disabilities contracted in the interests of<lb/>
humanity and science as voluntary subjects for the experimentations dur-<lb/>
ing the yellow fever investigations in Cuba&rdquo; to publish annually in the<lb/>
Army Register a roll of honor, and the officers and men whose names were<lb/>
to be placed on the said roll were specifically stated in that act. The<lb/>
part taken by them in the experiments is fully set forth in the reports<lb/>
of the Yellow Fever Board which are published in Senate Document <unclear>822,</unclear><lb/>
Sixty-first Congress, third session.</p>
<p>Dr. Alva S. Pinto served as Contract Surgeon in the Army from<lb/>
October 3, 1898, to April 4, 1901. He was stationed at Columbia Barracks,<lb/>
near Havana, Cuba, from December 2, 1898, to October 10, 1900. He had<lb/>
no other service in Cuba. When he left Cuba he went to the Philippines<lb/>
for duty, and served there as Captain and Assistant Surgeon, U. S. Volun-<lb/>
teers, until February 1, 1903.</p>
<p>The investigations referred to in the act of February 26, 1929,<lb/>
were made by a board of which Major Walter Reed, Surgeon, U.S.A., was<lb/>
president, appointed by the Secretary of War May 24, 1900 (SO No. 122,<lb/>
<unclear>AGO</unclear> that date). The board assembled in Cuba in June 1900, and conducted<lb/>
several series of experiments to discover the agency for the transmission<lb/>
of the disease. The first series was conducted during the period August 2<lb/>
to some time in October, 1900, while Major Reed was necessarily absent in<lb/>
the United States. Upon his return to Cuba he instituted a second and<lb/>
more elaborate series which began November 20, 1900, at an experimental<lb/>
case called Camp Lazear. A third series was instituted the following<lb/>
fall (1901).</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03273002"/>
<p>FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>Prior to the investigations by this board various theories had<lb/>
been suggested as to the means by which yellow fever is communicated from<lb/>
man to man, among them whether by bodily contact, by contact with the<lb/>
excreta of the sick, or by the bite of an infected mosquito. Dr. Carlos<lb/>
Finlay, of Havana, had several years before advanced the postulate that<lb/>
the mosquito was at least one agency of transmission; but numerous ex-<lb/>
periments made by him on that line had been entirely negative and his<lb/>
theory in August 1900 was generally discredited by the profession. Never-<lb/>
theless, there was sufficient speculative or conjectural basis to warrant<lb/>
further experiments either to confirm it on the one hand, or to exclude it<lb/>
from further consideration on the other. To that end, on August 11, 1900,<lb/>
Dr. Lazear, a member of the board, made the first experiment, consisting<lb/>
of mosquito bites on 9 persons, including himself and Dr. Pinto. The names<lb/>
of the other 7 are not shown on the records and are now unknown. All of<lb/>
those, like the Finlay tests, were unsuccessful (see page 18, Senate<lb/>
Document 822, above), as no adequate measures had then been taken to<lb/>
assure the conditions, which were later discovered, necessary for mosquito<lb/>
transmission of this disease. <hi>In other words, at the time these tests<lb/>
were made they were under a theory not generally believed, and those who<lb/>
submitted to them had no serious apprehension of danger therefrom</hi>. But<lb/>
within the next four weeks three cases of the disease followed subsequent<lb/>
mosquito bites under conditions which convinced Major Reed that the mos-<lb/>
quito was a transmitting agent, and led to the second series of more<lb/>
rigorous experiments beginning November 20, 1900, which left no doubt in<lb/>
the premises.</p>
<p><hi>Dr. Pinto took no part in those later experiments, having left Cuba<lb/>
on October 10.</hi> What he did was to allow himself on August 11 to be bitten<lb/>
by a mosquito, when mosquito transmission was a discredited theory and the<lb/>
bite thereof was believed by most to offer no hazard. In point of fact,<lb/>
the mosquito which bit him was perfectly harmless, and as shown by his<lb/>
medical history he suffered no disability whatever from the bite. The<lb/>
words of the bill referring to his &ldquo;high public service&rdquo; and &ldquo;the bravery<lb/>
displayed by him <unclear>in</unclear> incurring disabilities in the interest of humanity&rdquo;<lb/>
are unsupported by any facts of record in the Department.</p>
<p>Those who took part in the experiments of November 20 and later, by<lb/>
submitting themselves to the bites of infected mosquitoes, after the theory<lb/>
of mosquito transmission under certain conditions had been practically<lb/>
determined as outlined in Major Reed's preliminary report, did, however,<lb/>
consciously and most heroically put their lives in hazard, and in the view<lb/>
of the Department stand on an entirely different <unclear>festing</unclear>. The act of<lb/>
February 28, 1929, was intended to honor them for their bravery and re-<lb/>
ward them for the suffering consequent thereon. To include others within<lb/>
its scope whose bravery was in no sense conspicuous and who incurred no<lb/>
suffering and no disabilities whatever would be to disparage and <unclear>cheapon</unclear><lb/>
the honors and rewards heretofore conferred in this regard.</p>
<p><hi>Dr. Pinto's share in the experiments</hi> which have been of such great<lb/>
benefit to mankind was, for the reasons hereinbefore indicated, <hi>of little<lb/>
or no value</hi>. Certainly it was of no greater value than that of each of<lb/>
the 7 unknown who were also bitten by harmless mosquitoes on August 11.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f03273003"/>
-3-<lb/>
To pass this law, singling him out for special recognition, would at once<lb/>
pave the way for similar measures in behalf of the other 7, without any<lb/>
means of identifying or limiting the persons claiming to be among them.<lb/>
Nor would it be unlikely, considering how these things go, for a whole<lb/>
multitude to spring up, claiming similar recognition who, by reason of<lb/>
service in Cuba at the time the experiments were going on, were bitten by<lb/>
mosquitoes, or had yellow fever, or perhaps attended yellow fever patients,<lb/>
but who contributed in no real sense to the <unclear>epoch</unclear>-making experiments which<lb/>
have brought this dread disease under control.</p>
<p>In the Department's view the door to those extraordinary honors<lb/>
should not be opened to those who rendered no extraordinary service and<lb/>
made no measurable contribution to the work, but should admit only the<lb/>
three categories of persons covered in the existing law (or their depend-<lb/>
ents) namely, First, Members of the Yellow Fever Board; Second, Those who<lb/>
offered themselves for experiment by mosquito or blood inoculation and<lb/>
suffered attacks of yellow fever in consequence; Third, Those who took part<lb/>
in the infected bedding experiments.</p>
<p>Doctor Pinto's services as a contract surgeon and medical officer<lb/>
were wholly creditable to him, but, as in the case of thousands of others,<lb/>
in no wise beyond the call of duty, and do not entitle him in the opinion<lb/>
of the Department to the distinction and annuity proposed by S. 206. It<lb/>
is recommended, therefore, that that bill be not favorably considered.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Secretary of War</signed>.
