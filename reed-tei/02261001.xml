<p>What<lb/>
a dear, sweet Christmas<lb/>
letter came, yesterday, from<lb/>
the dearest woman in<lb/>
all the world! It did make<lb/>
me so happy to know that<lb/>
you, like a sweet, sensible,<lb/>
woman, were enjoying<lb/>
yourself in a quiet, peace-<lb/>
ful way, with the bird,<lb/>
&amp; the flowers &amp; <hi>the cat</hi>, al-<lb/>
though everybody was away<lb/>
from home, including even<lb/>
fat little scholar! You<lb/>
were right, my joy, in stop-<lb/>
ping<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02261002"/>
at the market to buy you<lb/>
some pretty flowers for your<lb/>
darling room- I know that<lb/>
the latter, under your deft<lb/>
fingers, looked beautiful<lb/>
and inviting. I wish that<lb/>
I could have peeped in<lb/>
upon my sweet Miss Gouty<lb/>
and her companions! What<lb/>
will you do, sweetheart,<lb/>
when I come back &amp; in-<lb/>
trude myself and my &ldquo;traps&rdquo;<lb/>
into your quiet habitation?<lb/>
I am very much afraid that<lb/>
my darling wifie will be<lb/>
too much crowded and made<lb/>
very uncomfortable- I will<lb/>
try, however, to make myself<lb/>
&ldquo;small&rdquo; and not take up too<lb/>
much room. If I get in<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02261003"/>
the way, you must tell<lb/>
me so, and I promise to do<lb/>
whatever you say! Dear<lb/>
aunt Jane, I was so sorry<lb/>
to hear that she was sick,<lb/>
and trust that it is only a<lb/>
slight indisposition of the<lb/>
&ldquo;liver&rdquo;! Do pray, give her much<lb/>
love for me when you<lb/>
write to her. Isn't it simply<lb/>
lovely that you, my precious<lb/>
joy, can <unclear>jet</unclear> about so well<lb/>
again, after so much lame-<lb/>
ness! Did you really walk<lb/>
to Lafayette Square and return?<lb/>
That <hi>was</hi> too far, sweet-<lb/>
heart! You should have<lb/>
ridden back- I can sympa-<lb/>
thize with you, sweetheart,<lb/>
for I have had <hi>two</hi> horrid,<lb/>
growling, grumbling, <hi>painful</hi><lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02261004"/>
C1<lb/>
B9<lb/>
<hi>teeth</hi> that have made me<lb/>
so mad &amp; disgusted during<lb/>
these last 3 or 4 days that I<lb/>
could hardly do any thing -- one<lb/>
of them is that horrid, nasty<lb/>
lower incisor tooth that I have<lb/>
been nursing for these last<lb/>
five years- I shan't be in<lb/>
Washington <hi>one day</hi> before<lb/>
I will have it &ldquo;yanked<lb/>
out&rdquo; nolens, rolens! You<lb/>
know how very trying, lovie, dear,<lb/>
that <hi>continual</hi> aching becomes,<lb/>
after it has kept up for<lb/>
half a week! I may have<lb/>
both of the &ldquo;growlers&rdquo; extracted<lb/>
before many days go by-<lb/>
Is there any thing so trying to one's<lb/>
disposition as an everlasting,<lb/>
never-ceasing pain? How my<lb/>
precious wife must enjoy<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02261005"/>
being rid of hers! Am so glad<lb/>
that auntie and the girls re-<lb/>
membered you with some-<lb/>
thing for your room- So you<lb/>
really haven't had much of<lb/>
a winter yet? I do hope,<lb/>
for the sake of all people who<lb/>
dislike cold weather, that <hi>this</hi><lb/>
winter will be a mild one.<lb/>
December here has been much<lb/>
warmer than November was.<lb/>
A temperature of 85&deg; is quite<lb/>
an ordinary one, these latter<lb/>
days. To-day, a hot southern<lb/>
wind has blown all day.<lb/>
So Johnnie Moore has sent<lb/>
in his last <del>check</del><add>bill</add> for 1900?<lb/>
Well, I, too, am very glad of<lb/>
it- Next year he will have<lb/>
to rest satisfied with less<lb/>
of an income.<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02261006"/>
I find, upon looking over my<lb/>
book of expenses, that we have<lb/>
expended on our dear Keewaydin,<lb/>
during 1900, the sum of <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>963.<hi rend="superscript">72</hi><lb/>
of this amount <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>212.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> was a<lb/>
second payment on the land<lb/>
purchased from Wastler- So that<lb/>
we really expended on im-<lb/>
provements during the year<lb/>
just <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>751.72 -- of this sum, we<lb/>
paid to Johnnie Moore for labor<lb/>
on house, stone fences, wood-<lb/>
land &amp; C <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>434.68- I find that<lb/>
to clear up that rear lot cost<lb/>
two hundred and seventeen<lb/>
dollars &amp; eight cents (<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>217.<hi rend="superscript">08</hi>).<lb/>
Well, there is one satisfac-<lb/>
tion, lovie, dear, it won't have<lb/>
to be cleared again! Aside<lb/>
from our house, we won't<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02261007"/>
have to expend much for im-<lb/>
provements here after- I think<lb/>
that one hundred or one hun-<lb/>
dred &amp; fifty dollars should cover<lb/>
expenses, the coming year, if<lb/>
we don't build our stable.<lb/>
I don't however begrude any<lb/>
money spent on our little home<lb/>
since I know how much pleas-<lb/>
ure my sweet wifie has ex-<lb/>
tracted out of the days spent<lb/>
there. If our precious little<lb/>
daughter would learn to<lb/>
love it as you and I do, then<lb/>
I should feel that there was<lb/>
no such sweet home in<lb/>
all the world! Never mind,<lb/>
I shall hope to see her busy<lb/>
digging in her flower-bed<lb/>
next year- I am quite sure<lb/>
that my sweet wifie will not<lb/>
fail to dig daily in <hi>her</hi> beds!<lb/>
And <hi>such</hi> flowers as she will have!<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02261008"/>

Monday morning. <hi>Dec. 31, 1900-</hi><lb/>
Good-morning my precious wifie<lb/>
and good morning, my dear little<lb/>
Annapolis Visitor! How are my<lb/>
precious girls on this the last<lb/>
day of the year and of the<lb/>
Century? Papa hopes that they<lb/>
are both well &amp; happy and<lb/>
thinking of him- Dear Me! Papa<lb/>
forgot that it <del>was</del><add>is</add> not yet<lb/>
<hi>seven</hi> o'clock &amp; that his joys<lb/>
snooze &amp; snooze <hi>long after that</hi><lb/>
hour! I guess the precious dears<lb/>
have just turned over for another<lb/>
hour's nap! Our last case, lovie<lb/>
dear, has no fever this morning<lb/>
&amp; is therefore practically convales-<lb/>
cent. He has been quite sick-<lb/>
Get up! Get up! and be smart<lb/>
girls for the new century! May<lb/>
the new year bring to my precious<lb/>
darlings much happiness and<lb/>
<hi>no gout</hi>! Love &amp; kisses for my sweet,<lb/>
sweet girls,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Devotedly,</salute>
<signed>Papa.</signed>
