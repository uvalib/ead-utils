<title>Letter from Jefferson Randolph Kean to Philip Showalter Hench, November 25, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Kean is excited about the discovery of the notebook at the New York Academy of Medicine. He was immune to yellow fever - after having it in June of 1900 - so was not bitten as part of Lazear's experiments. He is pleased with the memoir of Andrus, and lauds him for submitting to inoculation as Reed had determined to inoculate himself if Andrus had not volunteered.</p>

<salute>My dear Dr Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter which came last<lb/>
evening while we were sitting down<lb/>
to dinner bears all the evidences<lb/>
of your generosity and goodness of<lb/>
heart- It was written on Sunday<lb/>
and in long hand and was mailed<lb/>
with all the frills - air mail and<lb/>
special delivery- It offers me an<lb/>
increased abundance of Xmas gifts<lb/>
and gives me suggestions for pull-<lb/>
ing friend Kellogg's leg for more<lb/>
of the big copies of the Conquerors etc.<lb/>
Now as you reprints are from<lb/>
Kellogg &amp; so doubtless charged to the<lb/>
the Adv<unclear><hi rend="superscript">mt</hi></unclear> fund of John Wyeth &amp; Bro.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06307084"/>
Ac<lb/>
2<lb/>
I am going to demonstrate my vanity<lb/>
by asking for 40 more of your reprints<lb/>
I will have lots of fun sending them<lb/>
off a month hence-</p>
<p>I am much excited over Miss Wood's<lb/>
discovery of the notebook at the N. Y,<lb/>
Academy of Medicine- If it should<lb/>
be in very truth <hi>the</hi> notebook by Lazear<lb/>
and that George Carroll (the surly son)<lb/>
had sold it we would have verifications<lb/>
for a lot of things- What is this about<lb/>
electrozone? My diary, Vol. IV, the one I sent<lb/>
out to you to see shows that Reed was sent<lb/>
down from wash, to investigate the Electrozone<lb/>
plant which the U. S. Engineers had installed<lb/>
to make a disinfecting solution out of<lb/>
sea-water- He arrived March 10, 1900<lb/>
It was a patented process &amp; the royalty was<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06307085"/>
3<lb/>
heavy- The Engineers wanted to pay for it<lb/>
out of the medical appropriation &amp; the Med<lb/>
Dept objected- It was mildly disinfectant<lb/>
but the Med Dept had not been consulted<lb/>
about putting it in, and as the efficiency of the<lb/>
cesspool system depended on bacterial action<lb/>
(septic tanks) we did not believe in its use for<lb/>
<unclear>these</unclear> or for sprinkling streets where it was wast-<lb/>
ful expense- Now Lazear was on duty at<lb/>
Columbia Bks at this time and Reed may<lb/>
have asked his help- I dont remember about<lb/>
this-</p>
<p>As to Pinto's idea that I was bitten as one<lb/>
of Lazear's experiments he certainly was<lb/>
off the track- I was made an <hi>immune</hi> by my<lb/>
attack of Y. F. in June and Lazear would<lb/>
not waste his efforts on me <add>in August</add> my record<lb/>
for immunity was much more definite<lb/>
than Agramonte's. He told me that he<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06307086"/>
4<lb/>
left Cuba so young, that he was never<lb/>
sure of his immunity- It just shows<lb/>
how prone people are after many years<lb/>
to remember things that never happened.</p>
<p>John A. Andrus has sent me his Tale<lb/>
of a Guinea Pig with a very nice sensible<lb/>
letter- I am much pleased with it<lb/>
and will go over it for errors tomorrow<lb/>
It is natural straight-forward and<lb/>
modest. I have written him that we<lb/>
are all indebted to him for coming for-<lb/>
ward at the time when the volunteer<lb/>
in hand backed out and Reed had<lb/>
determined to use his own person for<lb/>
the experiment- What disaster for human<lb/>
ity it would have been if Reed had<lb/>
taken the blood injection and died!</p>
<p>With many thanks for your letter I am</p>

<salute>Ever yours sincerely</salute>
