<p>CAMP FATHER MATHEW,<lb/>
IN MEMPHIS, TENN., DURING THE YEL-<lb/>
LOW FEVER EPIDEMIC.</p>
<p>AT the outbreak of the yellow fever in Mem-<lb/>
phis, Tenn., in August last, Father Wil-<lb/>
liam Walsh, President of the Father Mathew<lb/>
Total Abstinence and Benevolent Association<lb/>
of that city, conceived the idea of establishing<lb/>
a camp in the suburbs where the members<lb/>
of the Society, with their families, could find<lb/>
refuge from the pestilence. A suitable loca-<lb/>
tion was found, and the camp was established.<lb/>
Hundreds soon flocked thither to escape the<lb/>
ravages of the fever in the city, the poor of<lb/>
all denominations being cordially admitted;<lb/>
and Father Mathew's Camp was the means of<lb/>
saving the lives of between four and five hun-<lb/>
dred people.</p>
<p>The camp was beautifully situated on a no-<lb/>
ble plateau, embosomed amidst lovely sylvan<lb/>
scenery. On one side it was shaded by a<lb/>
forest of stately trees, and on the opposite<lb/>
side ran a crystal stream, with a bubbling<lb/>
spring of pure fresh water close by. The<lb/>
camp represented a miniature city, with its<lb/>
streets and avenues crossing and intersecting<lb/>
each other. The two principal streets run-<lb/>
ning parallel with each other were known as<lb/>
&ldquo;Father Mathew Street&rdquo; and &ldquo;Father Wil-<lb/>
liam Street.&rdquo; These streets were about two<lb/>
hundred yards in length, and tents to the num-<lb/>
ber of nearly three hundred, furnished by the<lb/>
Government, were arranged on each side. In<lb/>
addition to an immense commissariat depart-<lb/>
ment--capable of meeting the demands of be-<lb/>
tween four and five hundred people daily--with<lb/>
the necessary kitchens, dining-halls, etc., there<lb/>
were hospitals, drug - stores, reading - rooms,<lb/>
schools, and a small church established in con-<lb/>
nection with the camp--all showing the most<lb/>
admirable thoughtfulness and excellent judg-<lb/>
ment on the part of the president and mana-<lb/>
gers. The schools were under the charge of<lb/>
the Sisters of St. Joseph, who divided their<lb/>
time between the children and the old folks,<lb/>
instructing the former and ministering to the<lb/>
comfort and happiness of the latter. At the<lb/>
northern end of &ldquo;Father Mathew Street&rdquo; was<lb/>
a little chapel of the Sacred Heart, with a<lb/>
sacristy on one side and confessional on the<lb/>
other. This miniature chapel was named<lb/>
&ldquo;The Ark.&rdquo; There Father Walsh celebrated<lb/>
Mass every morning, after which he went into<lb/>
the plague-stricken city to minister to the<lb/>
temporal as well as spiritual wants of the sick<lb/>
and dying, returning to the camp again at<lb/>
night. His return was anxiously awaited every<lb/>
night by the poor people, who feared that he,<lb/>
like so many of his associate priests, might be<lb/>
stricken with the disease while in the city. On<lb/>
his safe return their joy was great; they flocked<lb/>
around the little &ldquo;Ark&rdquo; to hear his words of<lb/>
consolation and instruction, to recite their<lb/>
rosary, and to receive, on bended knees, ere<lb/>
they retired to rest, the benediction of the<lb/>
Blessed Sacrament.</p>
<p>We publish two illustrations of the camp:<lb/>
one, the Thanksgiving Mass (the last celebra-<lb/>
ted at the camp), which shows the people in a<lb/>
kneeling attitude in front of &ldquo;The Ark,&rdquo; and<lb/>
the priest, Father William Walsh, in the act of<lb/>
turning round and saluting them with the final<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Dominus vobiscum</hi>--&ldquo;The Lord be with you&rdquo;;<lb/>
the other scene represents one of the main<lb/>
streets, just after Mass, as the campers were<lb/>
preparing to &ldquo;pull up stakes&rdquo; and return to<lb/>
the homes from which they had been driven<lb/>
by the dread pestilence a few months before.</p>

<p>In a couple of hours after the photographs were<lb/>
taken the camp was in marching order, and with<lb/>
the &ldquo;Ark&rdquo; in front, filled with little innocents<lb/>
dressed in white, and guarded by stalwart Father<lb/>
Mathew men, proceeded down the principal street<lb/>
of Memphis, towards St. Bridget's Church, where<lb/>
the Thanksgiving was brought to a close with the<lb/>
solemn chanting of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Te Deum</hi>.&rdquo; The little<lb/>
&ldquo;Ark&rdquo; is to be preserved as a Memorial Chapel in<lb/>
St. Bridget's Church.</p>
<p>It was remarkable that while the fever raged<lb/>
everywhere around the camp, a single case did not<lb/>
originate in it. Of eight or nine who died in the<lb/>
camp each case was contracted in the city. The<lb/>
camp was a continual source of charity during the<lb/>
fever, and its benevolence knew no creed or race.<lb/>
Father Walsh disbursed over twenty-seven thou-<lb/>
sand dollars independently of generous aid from the<lb/>
&ldquo;Citizens' Relief&rdquo; of Memphis.</p>
<p>Our illustrations are from photographs, copies of<lb/>
which our readers may order of R. M. Mansford,<lb/>
Jefferson and Second Streets, Memphis, Tenn., who<lb/>
has prepared a large number of each, size 8 &times; 10,<lb/>
which will be sold at seventy-five cents each for the<lb/>
benefit of the sufferers, the destitute and orphans,<lb/>
by the great epidemic.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>SCENES IN HAVANA.</p>
 <p>OUR first illustration represents the parlor in the<lb/>
Hotel Pasage, Havana. The sun can gain no<lb/>
admittance here, but the breeze comes from almost<lb/>
every direction, caressing the cheek of se&ntilde;or and<lb/>
se&ntilde;ora, caballero and se&ntilde;orita. Everything is<lb/>
deliciously cool, from<lb/>
the marble-paved floor<lb/>
to the cane rocking-<lb/>
chairs; from the sub-<lb/>
dued light to the open<lb/>
windows, through which<lb/>
comes stealing that pe-<lb/>
culiar, perfume only to<lb/>
be inhaled in the tropics.<lb/>
The parlor is crowded<lb/>
almost at every hour.<lb/>
Dark - eyed se&ntilde;oritas,<lb/>
such as Byron raved<lb/>
about, attired after the<lb/>
fashion of old Spain, in<lb/>
high comb and black<lb/>
lace, languidly fan them-<lb/>
selves with genuine Se-<lb/>
ville fans, with sails like<lb/>
miniature windmills;<lb/>
black satin, decorated<lb/>
with pictures represent-<lb/>
ing a <hi rend="italic">corrida de toros</hi>,<lb/>
or bull fight, from the<lb/>
first rush of the mad-<lb/>
dened bull into the<lb/>
arena to the last stroke<lb/>
of the graceful and her-<lb/>
culean <hi rend="italic">matador</hi>. Stately<lb/>
se&ntilde;oras, watchful as<lb/>
the traditional due&ntilde;a--<lb/>
haughty hidalgos, strong<lb/>
in lineage and manifold<lb/>
in name--all lounge,<lb/>
lean, sit, stand, walk<lb/>
and gossip in this fra-<lb/>
grant apartment. A<lb/>
piano is not wanting,<lb/>
at which some descend-<lb/>
ant of the Lady Dulcinea<lb/>
del Toboso will warble<lb/>
one of those quaint yet<lb/>
all melodious ballads so<lb/>
charmingly adapted to<lb/>
the guitar and casta-<lb/>
nets, that measure in<lb/>
three so marked in poor<lb/>
Bizet's opera of &ldquo;Car-<lb/>
men.&rdquo; Planters talk<lb/>
sugarcane, and planters'<lb/>
wives talk Worth; the<lb/>
hum of the grand,<lb/>
prayerful language of Spain drones musically,<lb/>
while gorgeous tropical flowers add color to a<lb/>
scene unique, charming, and all-satisfying.</p>
<p>THE EXTERIOR OF THE HOTEL PASAGE.</p>
<p>The exterior of the Hotel Pasage is particularly<lb/>
striking. The <hi rend="italic">fa&ccedil;ade</hi> is rich in plate-glass and bal-<lb/>
conies, while statues adorn the coping over the en-<lb/>
trance. An <hi rend="italic">alameda</hi>, or walk, shaded by trees,<lb/>
stands opposite, beneath which chairs and benches<lb/>
are placed for the accommodation of the public.<lb/>
The state apartments are in front and jealously<lb/>
guarded by closely drawn blinds during the reign<lb/>
of old King Sol; but in the early morning and at<lb/>
dewy eve these are thrown open, while the guests,<lb/>
in the coolest of possible toilets, lounge on the<lb/>
balconies, chatting, smoking and inhaling the per-<lb/>
fume-laden breeze, The <hi rend="italic">alameda</hi>, too, is thronged<lb/>
by a gay and animated crowd, which passes like a<lb/>
living, moving wave. The gilded youth of the<lb/>
island affect the Pasage, and, standing at its por-<lb/>
tals, pay the tribute of a stare to the charms of the<lb/>
Cuban belles.</p>
<p>THE TOMANDO CAFE.</p>
<p>This <hi rend="italic">caf&eacute;</hi> is much frequented by the upper tendom<lb/>
of the island, who stroll in for a gossip, a cigarette,<lb/>
an ice and a cooling drink. Its open doors are<lb/>
guarded by sentinels in the shape of prickly cacti,<lb/>
the pineapple &ldquo;on its native heath,&rdquo; or the dwarf<lb/>
palm, American rocking chairs are placed &ldquo;all in a<lb/>
row&rdquo; opposite the doorways, and their occupants<lb/>
rock to a measure that almost amounts to a lullaby,<lb/>
or a cradle-song. The swarthy attendants, attired in<lb/>
the snowiest of white,<lb/>
anticipate every want;<lb/>
while the <hi rend="italic">habitu&eacute;s</hi> have<lb/>
no necessity to issue<lb/>
orders, their wishes<lb/>
being forestalled. A<lb/>
cooler apartment than<lb/>
this does not exist on<lb/>
the island, while its<lb/>
&ldquo;fixins&rdquo; actually sug-<lb/>
gest, say a temperature<lb/>
of sixty degrees. Here<lb/>
is to be found the much<lb/>
coveted, much sought<lb/>
for <hi rend="italic">Diario de la Ma-<lb/>
rina</hi>, a newspaper<lb/>
which is to the Cubans<lb/>
what the Koran is to<lb/>
the followers of the Pro-<lb/>
phet, with many other<lb/>
journals, FRANK LESLIE'S<lb/>
ILLUSTRATED NEWSPA-<lb/>
PER included, and pe-<lb/>
riodicals. Every visitor<lb/>
to Havana &ldquo;does&rdquo; the<lb/>
Tomando <hi rend="italic">caf&eacute;</hi>, and does<lb/>
well.</p>
