DR. CHARLES H. SLOCUMB<lb/>
Gen. Jefferson R. Kean<lb/>
2804 N Street N. W.<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Although I am leaving for my first assignment this next Thursday,<lb/>
I have taken a little time for my yellow fever hobby. The biblical instruction,<lb/>
&ldquo;Seek and you shall find,&rdquo; has certainly proven true in my case. As you know,<lb/>
long search on my part failed to uncover the original fever charts on the<lb/>
experimental yellow fever cases in the Surgeon General's office, the National<lb/>
Archives, and elsewhere. Recently I saw a letter from Doctor Ames to the Surgeon<lb/>
General written in 1905, requesting that the charts be sent him for study as he<lb/>
had planned to write a book. There was no record of this letter in the files in<lb/>
Washington. Acting on this hunch, I wrote Mrs. Ames and lo and behold she had<lb/>
a large envelope with twenty-two original fever charts therein. Among them were<lb/>
those of Carroll, Lazear, Dean, Moran, Kissinger, etc., also your own fever chart<lb/>
and one of Doctor Ames himself. Mrs. Ames graciously (on my none to<add>o</add> subtle<lb/>
request) contributed these fever charts to our yellow fever museum. I had photo-<lb/>
stats made of them for her and herewith send you a photostat of your own fever<lb/>
chart and four sheets of clinical notes about you. Please note how neatly the<lb/>
fever charts are made out. That is true of practically all of them. The neatness<lb/>
of these fever charts had made me suspect that they were not really the &ldquo;originals&rdquo;<lb/>
but were copied during the patient's recovery and convalescence, either from the<lb/>
original fever charts which having been made out from day to day may have appeared<lb/>
rather sloppy or perhaps from merely clinical notes like those of yours which<lb/>
I enclose. I assume that these notes about you are in Lambert's handwriting. Is<lb/>
this true? Do you think that he made out a fever graph from day to day which<lb/>
original was destroyed, or has not yet been recovered, or do you think Ames'<lb/>
comment on the envelope that these are the original charts is correct?</p>
<p>I enclose the photostatic copy of the outside of the large manila<lb/>
envelope containing all these charts. The first and last paragraphs are in<lb/>
Doctor Ames' handwriting. The paragraph in the middle was written later by<lb/>
Mrs. Ames. Please note Doctor Ames' comments on the back of Dean's fever graph.<lb/>
His expression, &ldquo;the manner of taking poison,&rdquo; intrigues me greatly. At first<lb/>
I wondered if here wasn't another human interest story but never having heard any<lb/>
hints that Dean tried to take poison I have decided Ames was talking about the<lb/>
poison of yellow fever and that he meant the manner of his receiving the yellow<lb/>
fever inoculation. Is this your interpretation? Please keep all these charts<lb/>
for yourself except Ames' note about Dean. I would appreciate it if you would<lb/>
return this with your comment and interpretation written on the back.</p>

<p>August 1, 1942</p>
<p>The men in the Surgeon General's office, General Hillman, Colonel<lb/>
Lull and Major Durward Hall have been extremely kind to me. In all things so far<lb/>
they have kept their promises to me. I was delighted to hear from Major Hall<lb/>
this week that they consider the unit which I worked up an unusually good one.<lb/>
Major Hall's letter says, &ldquo;I believe that you should know that in all our<lb/>
experience in processing such cases for specific unit duty at specific stations,<lb/>
I have not come across a group so well worked up and projected as your proposed<lb/>
group.&rdquo; Maybe this praise is a little too fulsome, but none the less it is<lb/>
encouraging. I could have sent them twice the number of excellent applications<lb/>
that I sent. Already our group are being assigned to Camp Carson Station Hospital,<lb/>
Colorado Springs and a few are enroute there now. I leave this Thursday night,<lb/>
August 6, for some preliminary training at the Station Hospital, Fort Custer,<lb/>
Michigan. I understand that Lt. Col. Richman is the commanding officer of the<lb/>
Station Hospital at Fort Custer and Col. Clyde Oatman is the chief surgeon at<lb/>
Fort Custer, also that Col. Floyd Hunter is the chief surgeon at Camp Carson.<lb/>
Do you happen to know any of these men?</p>
<p>Permit me to drop you a note from time to time and please give<lb/>
Mrs. Kean our kindest regards.</p>
