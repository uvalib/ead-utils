<title>Letter from Laura Wood to Philip Showalter Hench, March 16, 1942</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Wood thanks Hench for comments on her manuscript - responding to some of them - and discusses her work. She used Ashburn's history of the Army Medical Corps for some statistics. Wood insists that Hench write his book on Reed because she feels it will be definitive.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thanks so much for your nice and painstaking letter,<lb/>
which I will answer in detail when I get back to<lb/>
Washington. Now I have to get on the train for<lb/>
Philadelphia in an hour or so.</p>
<p>First: after I broke my neck to get in by March<lb/>
15 they decided to put it over to Fall. What keeps<lb/>
me from being enraged is that it will give me a<lb/>
chance to <del><unclear>ans</unclear></del> check a couple more things - like who<lb/>
got sick during the fomites experiment (I don't know<lb/>
now where I got the idea it was Cooke) - and give<lb/>
Lazear more of a break. I hadn't known until I got<lb/>
these photostats that it was Lazear who caught on<lb/>
to Carter's tables and not Reed.</p>
<p>You absolutely <hi>must</hi> do your book on this - it will<lb/>
be final and definitive and neither General Truby's<lb/>
nor mine pretends to be - his is personal recollections<lb/>
and mine is about Reed only and fictionalized a bit<lb/>
as to conversations, etc. and neither covers the<lb/>
ground that yours will.</p>
<p>It is amusing that some of my conversations sound<lb/>
like Yellow Jack, because I didn't read it - only<lb/>
the first couple of scenes, that is. It seemed so<lb/>
lousy that i didn't bother to finish it since I al-<lb/>
ready knew it was inaccurate.</p>
<p>It was meant to be 1600, not 1000 soldiers and I<lb/>
used the rather poor expression stopped bullets be-<lb/>
cause I couldn't find out whether that many had been<lb/>
killed or killed and wounded, from the book I took<lb/>
it out of - it was <unclear>Ashburn'snhistory</unclear> of the Army<lb/>
Medical Corps. Those S-A War statistics are the<lb/>
dickens, anyway - I couldn't make head or tail of<lb/>
them and every book says something different. Neither<lb/>
did I especially care. The $20, 000 for the <unclear>MD</unclear> to<lb/>
spend came out of Ashburn, too.</p>
<p>The publisher shares your thought that it sounds a<lb/>
bit adult for kids. Unfortunately, it begins like<lb/>
a children's book, only somehow as the subject got<lb/>
tougher the kiddies got older. Also, General Kean<lb/>
says that Reed didn't tell him his suspicions about<lb/>
Lazear.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06115109"/>
<p><unclear>Ac<lb/>
Va</unclear></p>
<p>I'm afraid I've been pretty remiss not to see George<lb/>
Carroll - I heard about your adventures with him, and<lb/>
they were <unclear>noteencouraging</unclear>, however, so maybe I won't<lb/>
anyway.</p>
<p>Fitz Lee was rather a close friend of Kean's father,<lb/>
but Gen. Kean says he didn't call him that, so that's<lb/>
already changed. They knew each other in the Civil<lb/>
War, I guess.</p>
<p>Now I have to go catch my train.</p>
<p>I'll see if I can piece together a whole copy to send<lb/>
you, although I don't think I can right now - when the<lb/>
artist gets through maybe I can get his back. I was<lb/>
furious to see that he did the inside cover with an<lb/>
underclad nifty kneeling in the street beside a prone<lb/>
gent stricken presumably by yellow fever. I haven't<lb/>
any control over the illustrations, which will be a<lb/>
lesson to me if I ever do another book. However, they<lb/>
are pretty good on the whole, <unclear>what<del>'</del></unclear> I've seen.</p>
<p>Now I <hi>do</hi> have to go for the train.</p>
<p>I'm glad it was such a clean copy of Kelly - I didn't<lb/>
think you were hinting.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely</salute>
<signed><unclear>Laura <del>Wood></del>!</unclear><lb/>
