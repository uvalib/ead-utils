<p>Rojas thanks Hench for arranging Rath's visit and is sure he will be able to advise them on preserving the Finca San Jose. Rath felt that the restoration of Building No. 1 would be very expensive, and Saladrigas informed her that the Cuban government would not add to the $25,000 supplied by the previous administration. Rojas discusses the political situation involving Nogueira and the present government.</p>

Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>
Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Above all, I want to thank you for having introduced me to Mr. Frederick L. Raft,<lb/>
Jr. He is a charming person and very well qualified in intelligence in his field.<lb/>
We showed him a sufficient part of the &ldquo;old Havana&rdquo; in order that he might be able<lb/>
to appreciate the state of lamentable abandon in which our old monuments exist and<lb/>
the absolute lack of interest and in comprehension which exists for these things<lb/>
in Cuba. We talked a long time about our problems - the general ones as well as<lb/>
the private ones and I think that he will be able to help us in some way although<lb/>
it may be only with his advice.</p>
<p>In regard to Camp Lazear, we took him to visit the house and he was a little dis-<lb/>
couraged with the place because it seemed to him from his experience in these<lb/>
matters it would cost a great deal of money to put that all in good condition.<lb/>
He told me that he would write to you giving you his opinion. We also presented<lb/>
him to the Minister of Health but we were able to talk only a little about this<lb/>
matter because Doctor Saladrigas had not been informed about anything. After<lb/>
Mr. Raft left, I verified the condition in which the affairs are now in order to<lb/>
inform you of it. As you know, the previous government gave $25,000 to the<lb/>
guardianship then is that which has the money and the obligation of carrying<lb/>
out the project with which you are familiar. We spoke again with Doctor Saladrigas<lb/>
and he confirmed to us that this matter is in the hands of the guardianship - that<lb/>
he, for his part, is not interested in carrying out or raising any monument to<lb/>
Finlay in this place, since he is planning to do it in the Finlay Institute itself,<lb/>
intending to inaugurate it in the month of next September on the occasion of a<lb/>
congress of hygiene which will take place in Havana and where homage will be<lb/>
rendered to Finlay. At the same time he offered to help us in any way that we<lb/>
desire except by giving us money since he says that the official government left<lb/>
the money boxes empty.</p>
<p>That is how things were when I was getting ready to write to you. There appeared<lb/>
in the Diario de la Marina of <hi>the 18th of May the</hi> clipping which I hastened to<lb/>
send to you. Tomorrow I will pass by the place to see if they have begun the<lb/>
works, but it will be interesting to ask Dr. Nogueira if the park is not to be<lb/>
called Finlay why do they wish to inaugurate it co-inciding with the Congress<lb/>
where homage will be rendered to Finlay. And, incidentally, concerning Dr. Nogueira,<lb/>
I can tell you confidentially that he is not on good terms with the present<lb/>
government.</p>
<p>With affectionate greetings for Mary and regards from Lydia for both, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Affectionately yours,</salute>
