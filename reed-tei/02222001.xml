<p>Your<lb/>
dear letter of the 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Came<lb/>
on Wednesday, and yesterday<lb/>
being Thanksgiving &amp; your<lb/>
old Mr Mantee being very<lb/>
much occupied with nu-<lb/>
merous matters, he hasn't<lb/>
had time to write until<lb/>
this morning- I declare<lb/>
lovie, dear; I do sympathize<lb/>
so with you over your<lb/>
long confinement to the<lb/>
house, when I know how<lb/>
very irksome it must be</p>
<pb n="2" id="f02222002"/>
<p>Deliver me from an at-<lb/>
tack of the gout! I have<lb/>
had acute rheumatism<lb/>
twice and I know how very<lb/>
annoying that was- Bless<lb/>
your precious heart! to be<lb/>
sick and confined to your<lb/>
room, and no Mr Mantee to<lb/>
pet and care for you! It<lb/>
is perfectly dreadful!<lb/>
But it might be worse.<lb/>
You have a good bed to<lb/>
lie on and a sweet little<lb/>
daughter to nurse you<lb/>
and kind friends and a<lb/>
good doctor- If you had<lb/>
none of these, and the<lb/>
gout in <hi>both</hi> big toes,<lb/>
how much worse it<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02222003"/>
would be! Now do you<lb/>
see how well off you<lb/>
are? I know that you<lb/>
are uncomplaining and<lb/>
as patient as you can<lb/>
be, but it is tiresome to<lb/>
be shut in, especially when<lb/>
the weather is so warm<lb/>
and pleasant- Never mind,<lb/>
the gout will not last<lb/>
much longer and then you<lb/>
will able to take the fresh<lb/>
air once more- Just<lb/>
to think that this is the<lb/>
last day of November!<lb/>
To you the month has seemed<lb/>
long, I know, but to me<lb/>
it has fairly flown away!<lb/>
I never saw this pass<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02222004"/>
so rapidly- The day is gone<lb/>
before I can realize it.<lb/>
The finishing touches are<lb/>
now being put to our second<lb/>
house in the camp and I<lb/>
am so anxious to see it<lb/>
completed and everything<lb/>
in good shape for our<lb/>
work-</p>
<p><hi>Friday night</hi>- Dr Stark has just<lb/>
been in and chatted with me<lb/>
for an hour- He is fond<lb/>
of dropping in and discussing<lb/>
the mosquito theory with<lb/>
me and talking over profes-<lb/>
sional things general- Mrs.<lb/>
Stark is very sociable and<lb/>
often invites me over, to<lb/>
tea or dinner- Every morn-<lb/>
ing, one of her dear little<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02222005"/>
boys -- Alec -- the older one --<lb/>
comes over to see me; and<lb/>
if on questioning him, he<lb/>
says that he has been<lb/>
&ldquo;a good boy&rdquo;, I then give<lb/>
him a good <hi>hug</hi>, at<lb/>
which he seems to be<lb/>
very <add>much</add> amused and happy.<lb/>
Tell me, dearest, what did<lb/>
my precious wifie have<lb/>
for her thanksgiving dinner?<lb/>
I declare that I should<lb/>
have enjoyed my dinner<lb/>
more, had I not thought<lb/>
of my poor miss Gouty<lb/>
who was being deprived<lb/>
of hers! I do hope that<lb/>
Dr Nash gave my sweet<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02222006"/>
Farmer-lady permission<lb/>
to digest a little piece of<lb/>
the white meat of the Tur-<lb/>
key- If he didn't, I shall<lb/>
be real mad with him<lb/>
for being a cruel, cruel<lb/>
doctor! We really had<lb/>
in our mess a very ex-<lb/>
cellent dinner, winding<lb/>
up with Plum pudding<lb/>
and Mince-pie! Think<lb/>
of Mince-pie in Cuba<lb/>
when the weather is<lb/>
almost like Summer!<lb/>
I took the P.P., but left<lb/>
the others to consume<lb/>
the Mince! This afternoon,<lb/>
Col. Burton, the Inspector<lb/>
General of the Department,<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02222007"/>
came to call on me-<lb/>
you will remember him<lb/>
as a Captain at Fort<lb/>
Sydney- He has changed<lb/>
very little during these<lb/>
16 years, since I last<lb/>
saw him- His wife and<lb/>
daughters remain in<lb/>
the U.S.- This morning,<lb/>
Dr Truby left us for Cien-<lb/>
fuegos, Cuba, Darboy's<lb/>
station- He belongs to the<lb/>
medical corps, and is<lb/>
such a splendid young<lb/>
fellow &amp; good companion,<lb/>
that we all hated to<lb/>
see him go- He will be<lb/>
such an improvement on<lb/>
the medical officers now<lb/>
on duty at Cienfuegos<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02222008"/>
<hi>Saturday morning</hi> -- <hi>Dec. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi></hi>- what<lb/>
has become with Papa's daugh-<lb/>
ter that she doesn't write to<lb/>
him any more? Is the precious<lb/>
child too busy with her lessons<lb/>
and that pretty dress? or will<lb/>
Papa find a letter in to-day's<lb/>
mail from her? That would<lb/>
be a very great joy to her<lb/>
darling father- The morning<lb/>
is just a bit <hi>chilly</hi> and as<lb/>
father sits &amp; writes, clothed<lb/>
only in his beautiful <hi>pajam-<lb/>
as</hi>, he doesn't find himself any<lb/>
too warm- He <hi>so much</hi> hopes<lb/>
that to-day's letter will tell of his<lb/>
sweet, sweet wifie's great im-<lb/>
provement- That would make<lb/>
him very happy. Boo! Boo!<lb/>
kisses and love and love &amp; kisses<lb/>
for his precious girls-</p>
