<salute>My darling little E.;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Is it<lb/>
possible that the dearest,<lb/>
darlingest, sweetest, smar-<lb/>
test woman, in the world <add>has</add> hied<lb/>
herself to the beautiful City<lb/>
of Norfolk? I am informed<lb/>
that such is the case, by<lb/>
your postal received on<lb/>
Saturday, &amp; your letter<lb/>
to-day- Tell Miss Annie<lb/>
that I will never forgive<lb/>
her for not allowing you<lb/>
to finish your letter, ex-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01660002"/>
cept on one condition, (and that<lb/>
is a very easy one to comply<lb/>
with,) viz: that <add>she acknowledge that</add> there has not<lb/>
been such a sensible &amp; sweet<lb/>
woman in Norfolk during the<lb/>
past year. If she will agree<lb/>
to this, I'll relent &amp; say no<lb/>
more about it. Tell her, for<lb/>
me, that she now has the<lb/>
<hi>only angel</hi>, in this world, un-<lb/>
der her roof, &amp; that I beg<lb/>
of her to watch over this<lb/>
angelic being very tenderly<lb/>
for should aught occur to<lb/>
frighten or harm her, <hi>I</hi> should,<lb/>
at once, cease to exist!<lb/>
How could you, my little dar-<lb/>
ling, make up your mind<lb/>
to leave dear little Murfrees-<lb/>
boro, with all of its fasci-<lb/>
nating quietness &amp; fly to<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01660003"/>
a boisterous &amp; turbelent City<lb/>
like Norfolk? Ah! I forgot<lb/>
you said 'twas to visit your<lb/>
sister- Well, having had the<lb/>
pleasure of making the ac-<lb/>
quaintance of that sister, I<lb/>
do not wonder at your de-<lb/>
sire to clasp her to your<lb/>
heart. To you<del>r</del>, Emilie darling,<lb/>
I can say that she is a<lb/>
sweet lady, &amp; if she appears<lb/>
thus to me, what must she<lb/>
be to you, who calls her<lb/>
<hi>sister</hi>- That I may be able<lb/>
to thus address <add>her</add>, one of these<lb/>
days, is my earnest desire.<lb/>
However, I am afraid that<lb/>
one or two events which<lb/>
occurred, while I was at<lb/>
home, did not tend to elevate<lb/>
me in Miss Annie's estima-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01660004"/>
tion: such as the little &ldquo;breeze&rdquo;<lb/>
between Mrs. Douglas &amp; myself-<lb/>
But as I did the &ldquo;honorable&rdquo; by<lb/>
apologizing, I shall try to forget<lb/>
the matter, &amp; trust that Miss A.<lb/>
will not judge me too severely.<lb/>
I know how apt a person is<lb/>
to form an opinion of another's<lb/>
disposition by just these triv-<lb/>
ial happenings, &amp; when once<lb/>
formed, it is a difficult matter<lb/>
to dislodge it from one's mind-<lb/>
But, as I have often told you,<lb/>
my little E., I have much temper<lb/>
&amp; many shortcomings, &amp; hence<lb/>
you will not be disappointed.<lb/>
Still, I should regret very<lb/>
much to descend, in the estim-<lb/>
ation of so charming a lady<lb/>
as your sister- (All of this by<lb/>
the way however-)<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01660005"/>
Being in so large and gay<lb/>
a City as Norfolk, of course,<lb/>
there will be no lack of<lb/>
exciting events to put in<lb/>
your letters; and hence I<lb/>
shall expect the most start-<lb/>
ling incidents. I am very<lb/>
glad that you have gone<lb/>
to Norfolk, since I know you<lb/>
will experience much pleas-<lb/>
ure from your visit; but<lb/>
after all of this, I am sad &amp;<lb/>
solicitous. I'm so afraid that<lb/>
some of those fascinating lit-<lb/>
tle beaux of N. will steal<lb/>
your heart, leaving me so<lb/>
desolate &amp; forlorn- What<lb/>
if you should meet with<lb/>
one, from whose lips flow<lb/>
words of wisdom - whose<lb/>
eyes vie<del>s</del> with the Gazelle's<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01660006"/>
in brilliancy &amp; loveliness, and<lb/>
whose <del>form</del> commanding form<lb/>
surpasses the rising sun,<lb/>
(see description of Prof. M., by Miss E.B.L.).<lb/>
would you not forget the<lb/>
awkward youth, who ever<lb/>
walks too fast, who can't<lb/>
make a fire, or drive a horse,<lb/>
or gather flowers by the way-<lb/>
side &amp; <hi>who quarrels</hi> at the<lb/>
slightest provocation, &amp; own<lb/>
your heart enchanted by this<lb/>
City gentleman? Please, my dar-<lb/>
ling E. turn a deaf ear to them,<lb/>
when they prostrate themselves<lb/>
at your feet. Don't believe a<lb/>
word they say, for, I assure<lb/>
you, they are telling stories.</p>
<p>How long will you<lb/>
remain in N.? How nice it<lb/>
would have been for me<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01660007"/>
if I had only postponed<lb/>
my visit till the present.<lb/>
I could have <del>thus</del> saved one<lb/>
day, which was otherwise spent<lb/>
in travelling. If you will only<lb/>
promise to remain till next<lb/>
February, I will make a second<lb/>
attempt to come, &amp; then we can<lb/>
ride around (provided you<lb/>
would not object) &amp; see all the<lb/>
sights together.</p>
<p>I was down, last week, to see<lb/>
Dr Cuyler; but since, I believe, I<lb/>
told you of this, in my last let-<lb/>
ter, I'll not refer to it in this<lb/>
one. By the way, has my brother<lb/>
James called on you, since<lb/>
your arrival? I must write<lb/>
to him &amp; tell him to pay you<lb/>
a call, in order that he may<lb/>
see what the Old North<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01660008"/>
State can boast of. Now<lb/>
don't get frightened, for I am<lb/>
not going to tell him for some<lb/>
time yet-not till he comes to New<lb/>
York, which will be about<lb/>
the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of <del>this</del> Novr. You need not<lb/>
be disappointed at not receiv-<lb/>
ing very long letters, while he<lb/>
is with me, because I will be<lb/>
so busy showing him the sights<lb/>
&amp; talking over old times, that my<lb/>
opportunities of writing will be<lb/>
limited. For this miserably discon-<lb/>
nected letter, I must ask your in-<lb/>
dulgence- I could do better, as there<lb/>
were 5 officers sitting in the same<lb/>
room with me &amp; conversing on<lb/>
as many topics- Remember me<lb/>
very kindly to your sisters-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, as ever,<lb/>
Your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
