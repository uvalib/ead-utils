Dr. Henry R. Carter,<lb/>
2121 California Street, N.W.,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am trying this year to establish in<lb/>
addition to the course in epidemiology which I have<lb/>
heretofore given, a second course consisting of about<lb/>
twenty lectures in descriptive epidemiology, and am<lb/>
writing to ask if you would be willint to undertake<lb/>
two lectures in the course.</p>
<p>What I am trying to do is to present a<lb/>
fairly full discussion of the epidemiology of some eight<lb/>
or ten of the more important infectious diseases, select-<lb/>
ing at least one from each of the major epidemiological<lb/>
groups.</p>
<p>I have tentatively allotted two lectures<lb/>
each to typhoid fever, diphtheria, influenza, tuberculosis,<lb/>
yellow fever and plague, with one lecture each on small-<lb/>
pox, scarlet fever, measles and cerebrospinal meningitis;<lb/>
the remaining hours in the course to be devoted to intro-<lb/>
ductory and concluding lectures on epidemiological features<lb/>
in general and some comparisons of the various diseases<lb/>
discussed.</p>
<p>It has seemed to me essential that the<lb/>
lectures on the major or type diseases should be given<lb/>
so far as possible by men who have had rather extensive<lb/>
personal experience in studying them. In this department,<lb/>
between Dr. Preeman, Dr. Doull and myself we can take the<lb/>
lectures on typhoid fever, diphtheria, influenza and most<lb/>
of the minor subjects, but I am trying to find lecturers<lb/>
who have a real command of their subjects to give the<lb/>
lectures on yellow fever, plague and tuberculosis, and as<lb/>
to yellow fever there is no one but yourself to be<lb/>
considered.</p>
<p>Provided the course can be organized as<lb/>
now planned the lectures will be given on Tuesday and<lb/>
Thursday afternoons from 2 to 3 o'clock, beginning January<lb/>
2nd and extending to March 13th; and according to my<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01003027"/>
Dr. Carter<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
11-8-22<lb/>
tentative schedule the lectures on yellow fever, if<lb/>
we can find a lecturer, will come on February 6th<lb/>
and 8th.</p>
<p>Would you be willing to give these two lectures<lb/>
either on the dates suggested or on any other Tuesday<lb/>
and Thursday which might be more convenient to you? It<lb/>
is, I know, imposing upon your generosity to ask it, but<lb/>
I am very anxious to have yellow fever included in the<lb/>
course because it seems to me one of the most instructive<lb/>
of all diseases, and am even more anxious to have you<lb/>
included in it because we can offer nothing else in the<lb/>
course at all comparable to the discussion which you<lb/>
would give on yellow fever.</p>
<p>The honorarium which can be offered is very small,<lb/>
amounting only to $50 for the two lectures, with repayment,<lb/>
of course, of the travel expense-not enough to represent<lb/>
any return for the service but all that our very limited<lb/>
budget will permit.</p>
<p>If you can see your way to agree even tentatively<lb/>
to help us out to this extent I shall be very glad to<lb/>
come to see you sometime when I am in Washington, within<lb/>
the next few weeks, to outline to you somewhat more fully<lb/>
what I have in mind as to the scope of the course as<lb/>
a whole and to ask your advice about it.</p>
<p>With cordial regards to yourself and Miss Laura,<lb/>
and hoping that you can add this to your other burdens<lb/>
without unduly taxing yourself, I am,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>W. H. Frost</signed>.
