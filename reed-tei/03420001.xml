Mrs. Jessie Daniel Ames<lb/>
<salute>Dear Madam:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It has taken me a long time to get anything to show for my<lb/>
labor but now it seems to come in a bunch. The enclosed<lb/>
letters I have just received from Andrus. I'll send just<lb/>
as I received them so you can see why they have taken so<lb/>
long to get here.</p>
<p>From Miss Lewis, I haven't heard. I suppose her Congressmen<lb/>
haven't given her any reply.</p>
<p>I wrote Andrus asking him to formulate a letter demanding<lb/>
recognition for Dr. Ames and nurse, and get it signed by all<lb/>
the men who are still living that took part in the experiment<lb/>
and present the same to the chairman of the Military Affairs<lb/>
Committee. That's all I have been able to do where both bills<lb/>
have been directly concerned. But in all my efforts the bill<lb/>
to <unclear>recognise</unclear> Dr. Ames has always been put first and I don't<lb/>
think Congress would pass one and not the other. I think they<lb/>
will pass at the same time or not pass at all. If i'm called<lb/>
to Washington, I promise to do more talking for the Ames' bill<lb/>
than for mine.</p>
<p>At the State Convention in Moline the U.S.W.V. passed a reso-<lb/>
lution demanding that all Congressmen from this State use their<lb/>
best efforts to get my bill passed. Every camp in the state<lb/>
(131 in number) will contact their individual congressmen urging<lb/>
the passage of H.R. 4602 (my bill). The Commander of my V.F.W.<lb/>
Post who returned from the State Convention last night called<lb/>
and told me resolutions has been passed there, and that over<lb/>
300 posts would demand passage of H.R. 4602. But best of all<lb/>
National Commander Kearney who was at the Convention promised<lb/>
that every Congressman in the House would be contacted through<lb/>
the National Department of the V.F.W. and asked to pass H.R. 4602.</p>
<p>As it has already passed the Senate twice, I can't help thinking<lb/>
that our bills will pass at this session.</p>
