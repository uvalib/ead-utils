<salute>Dear Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Had an easy trip down rather hot<lb/>
from Greenville down -Cool enough to be pleas-<lb/>
ant on my arrival. Was met at the station<lb/>
by a note from Acker- saying that his family<lb/>
had gone to Canada &amp; asking me to stay with<lb/>
him. I was just getting into a bus to go to the<lb/>
<unclear>Gruenewald</unclear> when his messenger reached me.<lb/>
I accepted - as it prevents the nuisance of<lb/>
walking back and forth between hotel &amp;<lb/>
street cars. <unclear>Carput</unclear> is absent-gone to open one<lb/>
of the hospitals left us by the Army near-<lb/>
Jacksonville Florida, so Acker &amp; myself<lb/>
are the only medical men sleeping at the reser-<lb/>
vation- He has <hi>2</hi> new acting assistant<lb/>
surgeons.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00818059"/>
surgeons: No internes of 34 patients.<lb/>
I then keep him from getting lonesome,<lb/>
&amp; feel no hesitation at staying at his quar-<lb/>
ters, <del>I am n</del> Have finished with van <unclear>Hoven'g</unclear><lb/>
&amp; he left last night. Am now awaiting<lb/>
answer from Bureau to <hi>two</hi> wires-one sent<lb/>
(night letter) Monday &amp; one day message, yes-<lb/>
terday about noon- We recommended <hi>Frank</hi>-<lb/>
now at Gulfport- for van Hovenberg. <del>Pre</del> and asked<lb/>
if he is available- He will not be. I think, Allen,<lb/>
at Hattiesburg &amp; Jackson Miss., is next choice<lb/>
He will be. Then Ropes: then Gorman then<lb/>
Pincus.<lb/>
Everything is fixed- between <unclear>Vault</unclear> &amp; LeP.,<lb/>
so that we can present alternative names,<lb/>
until one will be available - so that matter<lb/>
so far as my part is concerned is finished<lb/>
It would have taken 6 weeks of writing<lb/>
from<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00818060"/>
from Baltimore. Le P. is in Montgomery to<lb/>
be back- Friday morning. On Friday morning<lb/>
the File on Roads O R. R., which you mailed<lb/>
either last night or this morning- will be<lb/>
in- If mailed even up to the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> mail<lb/>
(afternoon) they will be delivered by Friday<lb/>
<del>1.30</del><add>2</add> P. M. He &amp; I will do some thing with<lb/>
them &amp; then I will leave for Memphis,<lb/>
should be back next week latter part.</p>
<p>I am sorry not to go to church with you<lb/>
Good Friday &amp; on Easter. I still thank God<lb/>
for the Good Friday of 1917, which made Novem-<lb/>
ber 11 possible.</p>
<p>What of Dorothy, I hope she was not sick<lb/>
much- S. F: is a treacherous disease - <del>at dive</del><lb/>
at times very mild &amp; at times deadly. sometimes<lb/>
too it has ugly sequelae - suppuration of mid-<lb/>
dle ear- (Edmond Fontaine) &amp; Brights' Disease-<lb/>
of Kidneys- <unclear>wih</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00818061"/>
which, unlike Y. F. - does <del>frequently</del><add>at times</add> leave<lb/>
permanent injury- Attacks a different<lb/>
tissue. I am sorry for her sake for her many<lb/>
troubles-as well as for our own-</p>
<p>What of Gertrude &amp; <unclear>Louis</unclear>? Doubtless the latter<lb/>
has left for Charleston &amp; the former saw Hamman<lb/>
yesterday- Did she enter Hospital-<del>or will</del><lb/>
yesterday? I do not accept St. Theresa's dic-<lb/>
tum- that &ldquo;the vapors&rdquo; (<del>nenartha</del> hysleria) &ldquo;is mainly<lb/>
selfishness&rdquo;- but it does mainly occur in<lb/>
people who think too much <hi>about</hi> themselves<lb/>
i. e. who are self-centered - but of course frequently<lb/>
not selfish</p>
<p>Have you seen Clare Jenkins. yet? I hope you got<lb/>
a chance to do so.</p>
<p>Have not written to Henry- as until <del>this</del><lb/>
last night when I was dead tired- it was hot- I did<lb/>
not know when I would leave- &amp; now he could<lb/>
scarcely get down by Friday morning.</p>
<p>Love to your Mother &amp; Mary &amp; Jennie- <hi>Cool</hi>- almost <hi>cold</hi>- this<lb/>
morning, &amp; clear &amp; windy.</p>
