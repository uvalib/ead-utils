<salute>My dear <hi>Hutch:</hi></salute>

<p>After I added that P.S. on my last note to you, I thought it<lb/>
was rather childish. I asked Miss Hough to write to the two men if the<lb/>
photographs were lost. I was afraid that it would appear that I wasn't<lb/>
brave enough to face them myself. However, my point was that they would<lb/>
feel that I was careless with their photographs, and didn't deserve another<lb/>
one.</p>
<p>After rechecking and double checking, every possible place here<lb/>
they could have been, I find that they simply aren't here, and everything<lb/>
points to the fact that they were sent with the other photographs. But<lb/>
that is water over the dam and I am awfully sorry to have caused you so<lb/>
much trouble. I hate like the devil to have the college pay for these<lb/>
photographs. I suspect that they won't ask the college to do it, but if<lb/>
they do, won't you please let me do it? I can assure you I had so much<lb/>
fun and so much satisfaction out of the whole affair that I will always<lb/>
be indebted to you and the college.</p>
<p>Being a photographic fiend, I am really sorry that it so happened<lb/>
that I was the only one not having a photograph taken when you presented the<lb/>
degree. Did you by any chance tell the photographer, &ldquo;For Heaven's sake,<lb/>
don't photograph Hench. We don't want any permanent record of that!&rdquo;?</p>
<p>I have received the duplicate photographs, but not the others which<lb/>
Mr. Brewer mentioned (the ones I have not seen). Please be sure to send me<lb/>
if you can a few copies of the souvenir booklet which you are planning to<lb/>
get up on the Lazear Memorial. Also did you remember my request that if for<lb/>
any reason my citation should be published anywhere in your records, please<lb/>
demote me from president of the All-universe, All-world, All-hemisphere<lb/>
Rheumatism Association to merely the president of the American Rheumatism<lb/>
Association.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>

P. S. How about joining us for a West Indies vacation, or at least<lb/>
a Havana vacation in March?<lb/>
