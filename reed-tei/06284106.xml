<salute>My dear Gen. Kean-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am at home without a<lb/>
secretary &amp; want to write you tonight, but as I want to keep a<lb/>
copy as a memorandum I am taking the liberty of writing it<lb/>
<unclear>on</unclear> pencil. I have been so busy the past 2 weeks I don't know<lb/>
what I've written whom &amp; dont know how much I've told you of<lb/>
our more recent investigations- I should say, those of Moran &amp;<lb/>
Pogolotti although I have been in it all &amp; in correspondence with<lb/>
Moran <unclear>practically</unclear> day of <unclear>annail</unclear>. <del>I</del> think I told you that<lb/>
when we first visited Mrs Rojas I asked her if she recalled any<lb/>
contract, paper etc she might have seen written from or to Dr<lb/>
Reed of her husband but she said no. <unclear>Mrs</unclear> I sent her my long<lb/>
memorandum <unclear>apparent the panel</unclear> got inspired &amp; started <unclear>hunting</unclear><lb/>
around - found the day books just 2 weeks ago &amp; learned that<lb/>
contrary to them on <unclear>grand</unclear> recollection the 2 buildings were <hi>Not</hi><lb/>
to be destroyed but to be &ldquo;delivered to the original owner &amp; leasee.&rdquo;<lb/>
Well that leant authority to what a <unclear>Mr</unclear> 2 <unclear>ungunagui</unclear> had<lb/>
told us about a shock which <unclear>Moros</unclear> &amp; I first tried to<lb/>
visualize as either Bldg 1 or 2 but we decided against it<lb/>
for various reasons (See my memorandum). But with this<lb/>
<unclear>depute evidence</unclear> Moran &amp; Pogolotti re-opened then<lb/>
search &amp; concluded that the shock we'd looked over was<lb/>
Bldg #1 altered of having at that time 3 <unclear>lean</unclear>-too's<lb/>
attached to it. I have so wanted to behave it but felt<lb/>
that I had the critical so have been <unclear>firing</unclear> questions<lb/>
&amp; demanding certain special investigations. They've done<lb/>
then all (<unclear>fine</unclear> fellows, those!) and after examining<lb/>
the day book records (which came yesterday) I've<lb/>
convinced myself. The last possible conflict I think was<lb/>
ironed out just this afternoon. They found the bldg.<lb/>
facing the right way, the right size etc, with &ldquo;<unclear>tonghed</unclear><lb/>
&amp; <unclear>groved boards</unclear>&rdquo;, as Reed said. There was only one<lb/>
<unclear>hetch</unclear>- Agramonte's drawings of the bldg (&amp; I dont know<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06284107"/>
(2<lb/>
whether the drawing was made from memory in 1915 when the paper<lb/>
appeared or was copied from an original authentic one made<lb/>
STOVE<lb/>
in 1900) shows a stove on the right as one enters the<lb/>
bldg. In our bldg there was a hole (long unused) for<lb/>
a stove pipe but it was on the <hi>left</hi> side. I wrote Dr<lb/>
Cooke &amp; have just heard from him this afternoon He<lb/>
said that despite Agramontes' drawing he (Cooke)<lb/>
remember it as having been on the left! So (altho I will not be<lb/>
finally convinced until I can examine it myself this spring-<lb/>
I will go down again) there <unclear>seems</unclear> little doubt about it.<lb/>
At least I have already taken steps to purchase it for<lb/>
immediate protection. Even <unclear>since</unclear> I was there they have<lb/>
<unclear>torn</unclear> down one of the additions (fortunately not the<lb/>
original part). I have no ulterior motive I can assure you.<lb/>
You are aware that I stepped into the <unclear>ma'al</unclear> of the<lb/>
Finlay versus Reed <unclear>Common</unclear> controvercy &amp; vowed<lb/>
Id do what I could to stay the feud <unclear>with</unclear> honor for<lb/>
all. The Cubans want (?) to <unclear>visualize</unclear> Lazear &amp;<lb/>
we wasn't <unclear>imitate</unclear> them by stressing their mistake in<lb/>
the Camp Site. I had hoped to keep most of this<lb/>
secret (or at least confidential) from Dr Ramos until<lb/>
I had the plan all fool-proof &amp; the bldg absolutely<lb/>
certified to my satisfaction. I was going to called<lb/>
some money to restore it, paying for the bldg and/or<lb/>
its replacement myself as my own <unclear>constutution</unclear> to start<lb/>
the ball rolling. <hi>Then</hi> &amp; not till then I was going to<lb/>
make certain specific suggestions to Ramos &amp;<lb/>
offer to <hi>give</hi> her the bldg restored etc to be used<lb/>
perhaps as part of their &ldquo;Lazear memorial&rdquo; on the<lb/>
site of their choice (perhaps) - that is, on the site where<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06284108"/>
3<lb/>
Lazear died. However that matter was to be decided later. I hope<lb/>
that Moran won't push the matter <hi>any more</hi>, yet. Please discuss<lb/>
it with him at U of Va of you <unclear>Y Fer fo.</unclear>. I thought this was a<lb/>
most fortunate discovery &amp; that a group of <hi>Americans</hi><lb/>
could work the thing up &amp; give it to Cuba as a token<lb/>
of appreciation 1) as the place where the <hi>concept of<lb/>
Finlay</hi> was <hi>proved correct</hi> of the work of the U S<lb/>
<unclear>any common</unclear> 2) as a token of our appreciation<lb/>
that Cuba thought so much of Lazear et al.<lb/>
He could have an appropriate love feast using<lb/>
the shack etc as a viable token &amp; symbol &amp; all<lb/>
bury the <unclear>batchet</unclear>. It was my idea to get the bldg<lb/>
legally (tentatively) protected in my hands now,<lb/>
then form a small advisory committee (you among<lb/>
them) to investigate our findings &amp; approve our plan,<lb/>
to keep <unclear>us out aduse</unclear> &amp; prestige - &amp; then when<lb/>
all was set I'd write some friends here &amp; there, friends of mine,<lb/>
friends of Reeds, Lazear et al, and the Deans of the<lb/>
various medical schools &amp; hospital <add>(including the Rockefeller)</add> which pride themselves<lb/>
on them having educated <unclear>there over</unclear>. If we couldn't<lb/>
raise 2 or 3000 or so <unclear>of</unclear> private subscription (letters &amp;<lb/>
some interviews) I <unclear>miss</unclear> my guess. If we could get enough<lb/>
not <unclear>only</unclear> to restore it (&amp; move it perhaps) but also to build a nice<lb/>
small one &amp; 1/2 <unclear>storey</unclear> spanish type of bungalow to<lb/>
enclose the bldg &amp; protect it, with perhaps a small<lb/>
museum on one side &amp; rest rooms (?) on one side<lb/>
&amp; have it placed in an appropriate part of the<lb/>
Cuban <unclear>memorial</unclear> group I think that would be<lb/>
very nice.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f06284109"/>
<p>4</p>
<p>In the museum we could slowly get souvenirs of Finlay, Reed<lb/>
Lazear et al., perhaps an appropriate bronze tablet or<lb/>
painting etc; photographs, photostats of Rojas day book,<lb/>
maps identifying original location, copies of the old<lb/>
any photos, <unclear>replace</unclear> of the Finlay medal, the<lb/>
Congressional medal etc.</p>
<p>I should think the whole thing could be done quietly<lb/>
&amp; semi-privately with the names of a half dozen<lb/>
of you who have loved Reed et al &amp; know the value of<lb/>
their work, your names but to us as an <unclear>advisory<lb/>
committee</unclear> &amp; to assure those we or I approach of<lb/>
my sincerity &amp; interest &amp; the authenticity of our<lb/>
investigations (of which you would have to assure<lb/>
yourselves just to your complete satisfaction.<lb/>
Perhaps Gen Truby &amp; you, <del>Gen Reed, Mrs</del>. If the<lb/>
collections were small &amp; slow I'd merely have an<lb/>
account here in a separate <unclear>bank</unclear>. If we really got<lb/>
somewhere - enough even as an <unclear>answer</unclear> contribution<lb/>
toward <unclear>their</unclear> memorial we'd have a bonded Treasurer<lb/>
etc. Perhaps I am away ahead of myself - in fact<lb/>
I know I am. Im merely thinking out loud<lb/>
&amp; putting <hi>confidentially</hi> on paper what I'd not meant<lb/>
to discuss until the property was <hi>S A F E</hi> in interested<lb/>
hands. Id appreciate hearing your comments at<lb/>
your leisure either before or after you see Moran.<lb/>
(<unclear>Wed</unclear> certainly let Dr Cooke, Mrs Lazear, Gen Reed etc<lb/>
know what were up to let I think theyd applaud<lb/>
our efforts don't you?</p>
