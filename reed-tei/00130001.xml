<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>You see I have reached<lb/>
my destination. Our steamer got to<lb/>
Moville at 10 A.M. on Wednesday and<lb/>
reached Glasgow at 11.P.M. We<lb/>
stayed at Glasgow over night and<lb/>
came over to Edinburgh yesterday<lb/>
morning. Yesterday afternoon we called<lb/>
at the University and made our<lb/>
arrangements, and to-day we went<lb/>
regularly to work. I have been<lb/>
dissecting all afternoon.</p>
<p>The University buildings are very fine.<lb/>

I will tell you more about them<lb/>
later on.</p>
<p>The trip along the north coast of Ireland<lb/>
and up the Clyde was magnificent.<lb/>
The beauty of the scenery was much<lb/>
beyond what I had expected. There<lb/>
were bold headlands with sometimes<lb/>
a green slope. I shall not attempt<lb/>
to describe it at all. Throughout the<lb/>
whole day this grand panorama lasted.<lb/>
When we reached Glasgow at 11 P.M. it<lb/>
was just getting dusk. I have not yet<lb/>
had time to see much of Edinburgh. It is<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00130002"/>
certainly a very odd old town, but I am<lb/>
getting used to the foreign ways already.<lb/>
The girls here all have a very peculiar<lb/>
ruddy complexion, and they are all<lb/>
rather robust. Woman do all sorts<lb/>
of heavy work, they actually carried<lb/>
one of our trunks upstairs as though<lb/>
they were used to that sort of thing<lb/>
Women walk through the streets delivering<lb/>
milk; they wear short dresses and have<lb/>
their arms bare. We see men<lb/>
dressed in plaid and kilts quite often<lb/>
and Scotch caps are very often seen.<lb/>
It is very cold and has been raining<lb/>
off and on ever since I got here.<lb/>
The arrangement here at Mrs Magills<lb/>
is not just what we expected She<lb/>
has given us a large front room<lb/>
on the second story <del><unclear></unclear></del> one end<lb/>
of which is screened off for a bed-<lb/>
room for Norris and Nicoll while<lb/>
Waring and I occupy a room in<lb/>
the third story. We have our meals<lb/>
together in the large second story room.<lb/>
The rest of the boys seem entirely<lb/>
satisfied with the arrangement.<lb/>
But I am not used to having any one<lb/>
else in the room and I think I shall<lb/>
withdraw from the arrangement in a<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00130003"/>
few days. I can get a room to myself<lb/>
easily in some other house. I think<lb/>
I can do better by myself than with<lb/>
the party. Mrs. Magill gives us a very good<lb/>
table.</p>
<p>I have met several of the demon-<lb/>
strators at the University and they<lb/>
are very kind to us. One of them, to<lb/>
whom Norris had a letter showed<lb/>
us around the Anatomy department<lb/>
and told us how to find the matricula-<lb/>
tion office and everything, and offered<lb/>
to give us any information we<lb/>
wanted about things outside the<lb/>
University. I have not told you<lb/>
how glad I was to get your letter<lb/>
and paper when I arrived. I found<lb/>
them lying on my table, and I sat<lb/>
right down and read them. The feeling<lb/>
of having been out of communication<lb/>
with the world for eleven days is very<lb/>
peculiar, I cannot realize that,<lb/>
the world has gone on as usual during<lb/>
that time. We seem to commence<lb/>
just where we left off on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of<lb/>
May. I know I have forgotten lots of things<lb/>
that I wanted to say, but I will say them again.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
