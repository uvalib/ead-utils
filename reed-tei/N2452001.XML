<p>THE QUESTIONS<lb/>
OF THE DAY</p>
<p>The following is from the<lb/>
New York <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> of the 21st.<lb/>
inst:</p>
<p>An uncommonly significant docu-<lb/>
ment is the official report of the chief<lb/>
sanitary officer in Cuba for the last<lb/>
month. Briefly, it shows that, instead<lb/>
of being as of old plague infested,<lb/>
that island is becoming salubrious, as<lb/>
nature intended it to be, and that<lb/>
Havana, instead of being a perennial<lb/>
lazaretto, is taking rank among the<lb/>
most healthful cities of its size in the<lb/>
world. The midwinter month is, of<lb/>
course, the time in which the lowest<lb/>
death rate is naturally to be looked<lb/>
for in a semi-tropical city. But there<lb/>
is unmistakable significance in com-<lb/>
parisons of last month's rate in<lb/>
Havana with that in the same month<lb/>
three years ago, and with that of the<lb/>
same month in other cities not dis-<lb/>
similarly situated. In February, 1898,<lb/>
under Spanish rule, the death rate<lb/>
was 82.32 in the thousand, and in<lb/>
February, 1901, under American rule,<lb/>
it was 19.32. In Havana the death<lb/>
rate was 19.32 in the thousand, while<lb/>
at practically the same time in New<lb/>
Orleans it was 28.26; in Mobile it<lb/>
was 29.73, and in Jacksonville it was<lb/>
48.37. In New-York, Boston, Newark,<lb/>
Washington, Baltimore and other<lb/>
Northern cities the death rate was<lb/>
and doubtless is to-day higher than<lb/>
in Havana.</p>
<p>We need not enter into discussion<lb/>
of the administrative details by means<lb/>
of which this most admirable change<lb/>
has been effected. Whitewashing and<lb/>
disinfecting houses, asphalting streets,<lb/>
segregating fever patients, waging war<lb/>
against the infection carrying mosqui-<lb/>
toes--all these things are to be<lb/>
summed up in the one word sanita-<lb/>
tion. That sanitation, too, has, been<lb/>
effected under American control and<lb/>
direction.</p>
<p>It has been done by the American<lb/>
administration of insular affairs.<lb/>
Whether it would or could have been<lb/>
done by the Cubans unaided is an<lb/>
open question, which may be an-<lb/>
swered in the negative. At any rate,<lb/>
the work as thus far done is an<lb/>
American work, and it is one of the<lb/>
most beneficial works that could have<lb/>
been done for Cuba itself and for<lb/>
every community and country in the<lb/>
world that has or expects to have<lb/>
relations with Cuba. In the terms<lb/>
prescribed by Congress for the turning<lb/>
over of insular affairs to the Cubans<lb/>
themselves it is stipulated that that<lb/>
beneficent work shall be maintained.<lb/>
The stipulation is not only a reason-<lb/>
able and just one, but is, by virtue<lb/>
of such facts as those presented in<lb/>
the report we have quoted, made ab-<lb/>
solutely incumbent and imperative.<lb/>
After the gain that has been made<lb/>
for human health and life, to let the<lb/>
island relapse, or to risk its relapsing,<lb/>
into the old conditions of disease and<lb/>
death would be an unspeakable wrong<lb/>
and shame.</p>
<p>Whether it could or would<lb/>
have been done by the Cubans<lb/>
is an open question, which may<lb/>
be answered in the negative, is<lb/>
a fair example of the usual tone<lb/>
of American Administration or-<lb/>
gans when discussing the island<lb/>
which for its own good, the<lb/>
horde of McKinley followers is<lb/>
attempting to take unto itself.</p>
<p>What grounds has anyone for<lb/>
supposing that Cubans would<lb/>
prove less desirous of preserving<lb/>
cleanliness and health than are<lb/>
the authorities who have been<lb/>
in control for two years?</p>
<p>Havana was filthy before<lb/>
American occupation, but that<lb/>
filth was due to corrupt Span-<lb/>
ish officials who applied public<lb/>
funds to amelioration of private<lb/>
needs. Not a Cuban had a voice<lb/>
in affairs of state or municipality.</p>
<p>Why, then, should the Ameri-<lb/>
can anti-independence press in-<lb/>
dulge in such easily exposed<lb/>
sophism?</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that<lb/>
Cubans, had they been in power,<lb/>
would have had the paving and<lb/>
sewering of Havana half finished<lb/>
by this time.</p>
<p>The American military auth-<lb/>
orities have, for over two years,<lb/>
managed to cause delay which<lb/>
has resulted in leaving us with-<lb/>
out sewers at the beginning of<lb/>
our third summer under Ameri-<lb/>
can rule.</p>
