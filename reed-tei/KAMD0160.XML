To the<lb/>
CHIEF SURGEON,<lb/>

<salute>SIR:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have the honor to make the following report of a consultation<lb/>
held by the board appointed to examine cases suspected of being Yellow<lb/>
Fever.</p>
<p>The consultation was held at the Isolation Camp on June 4, 1900,<lb/>
the following members of the board being present: Drs. Herrera, Angles,<lb/>
Ames and Lazear.</p>
<p>Histories of Cases and Findings.</p>

Admitted May 23, 1900. <add>Malarial fever in Dec. '99</add> Patient had not been in Havana lately. Was at<lb/>
Guanajay for one night just before onset of present trou<del>o</del><add>b</add>le. Onset was<lb/>
rather gradual, beginning four days before admission to hospital. No<lb/>
chill. Became worse suddenly on day before admission. Vomited once.<lb/>
Headache and malaise. Great weakness. On admission temperature was<lb/>

moderate jaundice developed. Albumen increased in urine until on May<lb/>
27, the coagulum on boiling filled 9&sol;10 of the tube. Bile stained<lb/>
granular and epithelial casts were very abundant. After May 28th the<lb/>

albumen slowly diminished. Widel reactions were tried daily up to the<lb/>
8th day. with constantly negative result. The temperature fell gradu-<lb/>
ally making one sudden drop on May 25. Patient is now convalescent.<lb/>
All members agree that this case was undoubtedly Yellow Fever.</p>

not enlarged. Urine contained a great deal of albumen and a few gran-<lb/>
ular casts. The blood contained no malarial parasites and gave no re-<lb/>
action for typhoid fever. The albumen increased until on May 29th <add>the</add><lb/>
coagulum filled half the tube. On June 1st it had to 1&sol;10. On<lb/>
May 26, temperature was 100.3 F. pulse 63. Vomiting and jaundice developed<lb/>
but patient on the whole was fairly comfortable. Diagnosis: Yellow<lb/>

r<lb/>

result. Temperature fell to 100 on 2nd day and then rose to 103.<lb/>
After that there was a gradual decline to normal. All were of opinion <del>th</del><lb/>
that this case was suspicious but that a positive diagnosis of <del>y</del><add>Y</add>ellow<lb/>
Fever could not be made.</p>
<p><add>4</add> Albert Teeter, Priv., Hospl Corps. Living at #102, Real St.<lb/>
Born in Nebraska. Onset gradual beginning five days before admission<lb/>
with malaise and headache. On admission temperature 102.5, pulse 108.<lb/>
Face flushed. Conjunctivae congested. Headache. No jaundice.<lb/>
Urine showed a good trace of albumen with a few granular casts. Blood<lb/>
contained no malarial parasites and gave no Widal reaction for typhoid.<lb/>
Members of the board with the exception of Dr. Ames considered the case<lb/>
one of Yellow Fever. <add>(Dr Ames afterward concurred in diagnosis J.R.K)</add></p>
<p><add>5</add> Richard Crane, Pvt. Troop &ldquo;B&rdquo;, 7th Cavalry,. Born in Maine.<lb/>
Sudden onset with chill two days before admission. Slight headache.<lb/>
No vomiting. Cough with rusty spu<del>r</del>ta. On admission temperature 104.2<lb/>
pulse 99. Tongue coated, -- a little red on edges. <add>No jaundice</add> Conjunctivae<lb/>
much injected. There was a slight dullnes at left apex with crepatent<lb/>
and moist rales. Typical sputum of pneumonia Spleen not enlarged.<lb/>
Urine con<del>y</del><add>t</add>ained a trace of albumen and a few finely granular casts<del>.</del><lb/>
Pulse has ranged from 84 to 103. Drs. Herrera and Angles consider this<lb/>
case Yellow Fever. Dr. Ames tinks it is simple pneumonia. Dr. Lazear<lb/>
thinks it suspicious.</p>
<p><add>6</add> Mrs. Sherwood, 20, General Lee St., Quemados. Born in Norway.<lb/>
Widow of Sergt. Sherwood who died of Yellow Fever at this camp on the day<lb/>
the patient was admitted<add>,</add> May 31. She had been feeling out of sorts for<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="fKAMD0190"/>
Page 4.<lb/>
several days. Tempera ture 99. On January 2 temperature rose sud-<lb/>
denly to 104.6, pulse 107. January 3, temperature 101, pulse 106<del>.</del><lb/>
Slight hacking cough. Skin is a dusky yellow with small darker blotches.<lb/>
Tongue coated -- red at margin. Gums bleeding. Urine contained a<lb/>
distinct trace of albumen. No microscopic examination made. Blood<lb/>
contained no malarial parasites. Diagnosis: Yellow Fever.</p>
<p><add>7.</add> Marie Bertha Sherwood, child of Sergt. Sherwood, was admitted on<lb/>
on May 31. Temperature 102.4, pulse 100. Temperature gradually fell<lb/>
to normal. No albumen or casts were found in the urine at first but<lb/>
on J<add>u</add>n<del>y</del><add>e</add> 3rd a very faint trace of albumen was demonstrated. Slight head-<lb/>
ache and malaise. At <del>the</del><add>time of</add> consultation the child was perfectly well.<lb/>
Drs. Herrera and Angles were of the opinion that the case was one of<lb/>
&ldquo;Infectious Fever&rdquo;. Drs. Ames and Lazear considered that as the child<lb/>
lived in an infected house and in the same room with her father and<lb/>
mother both of whom had Yellow Fever, she had had a mild case of Yellow<lb/>
Fever.</p>
<p>In the examination of these cases Drs. Herrera and Angeles laid<lb/>
great stress on the characteristic odor of the breath and on the red-<lb/>
ness about the scrotum and neighboring parts in the males.</p>
