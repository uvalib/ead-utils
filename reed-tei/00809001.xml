<salute>My Dear Mrs Carter &amp; All:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter<lb/>
was such a pleasure to get, and<lb/>
am going to try &amp; send a few lines<lb/>
in Return at <hi>once</hi>. Am sorry to hear<lb/>
you are not very well. I sincerely<lb/>
hope when the weather warms<lb/>
up that you will be <hi>better</hi>, It sure<lb/>
is lonesome to have Dr. Carter &amp;<lb/>
Miss Laura so far away from<lb/>
<hi>you</hi>. But oh my Dear Mrs Carter you<lb/>
have such look <hi>Care</hi> &amp; <hi>Company</hi> having<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00809002"/>
<hi>2</hi><lb/>
Dr. Carter Jr. &amp; Miss Mary Carter with<lb/>
<hi>you</hi>, I sure shall never forget the<lb/>
Kindness you all did for me during<lb/>
my spell of <hi>illness</hi> there,</p>
<p>My Mother is here with me which<lb/>
has been lovely for <hi>me</hi> as I have<lb/>
not be so very <hi>well</hi> But glad to<lb/>
say I am feeling real good <hi>now</hi>.<lb/>
Have been doing quite a bit of<lb/>
<hi>sewing</hi> &amp; been out planting<lb/>
flowers &amp; some <hi>Veg</hi>,. Sewing This<lb/>
spring has been lightened a great<lb/>
deal, by we getting a New Machine<lb/>
and an Electric Motor to run<lb/>
<hi>same</hi>, and I have found same<lb/>
a Wanderful help to <hi>me</hi>, Being<lb/>
Mamma &amp; Little Bernice are here<lb/>
I have extra sewing as I want<lb/>
to have their sewing all done before<lb/>

<hi>3</hi><lb/>
They leave for Wisconsin, I find it a<lb/>
great pleasure to think I am given<lb/>
strenght to be able to do same,<lb/>
Mamma has not been well at all of<lb/>
late, And of course Life has been<lb/>
made very Lonely for <hi>her</hi>.</p>
<p>But how sad &amp; dark it is made for<lb/>
us, we must try and think it<lb/>
is all done for the <hi>best</hi>,<lb/>
Mr Heplers Mother Died the first<lb/>
of <hi>Mar</hi>, so he was home for a week<lb/>
and I sure was glad my Mother was<lb/>
<hi>here</hi> at the <hi>time</hi>. so I was not <hi>alone</hi><lb/>
For it was so very cold in Wisconsin<lb/>
Mr Hepler thought best for me not to<lb/>
go with <hi>him</hi>, <add>not</add> being very well at that<lb/>
<hi>time</hi>, Well we are having a real cool<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00809004"/>
4<lb/>
<hi>Spring</hi>, I have planted sweet peas &amp; they<lb/>
are up But don't grow very fast being<lb/>
so <hi>cool</hi>. We have a lot of <hi>Beds for</hi> flowers<lb/>
<hi>here</hi>, next is what to plant in <hi>them</hi>.<lb/>
Dr. Holt &amp; Family do not live @ Hospital<lb/>
So the flower planting is left to Mr:-<lb/>
Hepler &amp; myself, and we are going to<lb/>
do the best we <hi>can</hi>. We have set out<lb/>
quite a few &ldquo;Rose bushes only hope<lb/>
they will do <hi>well</hi>. And we have planted<lb/>
Choice dwarf Nasturtimus as a border<lb/>
around the Building, and have<lb/>
ordered Started Cannas for two<lb/>
large beds, and I have planted<lb/>
several different Kinds of flower<lb/>
seed in Hot house beds to be transplanted<lb/>
and I have a Bed of Choice Pancies<lb/>
which we were in town &amp; got a<del>bout</del><lb/>
couple of weeks ago. But have had to<lb/>
keep them covered <del>the</del> most of the time<lb/>
so they wouldn't get <hi>chilled</hi>, <hi>Oh</hi> I watch<lb/>
the seeds &amp; all every day to see if they<lb/>

<hi>5</hi><lb/>
show any signs of growing. We are<lb/>
in hope that they will grow so we can<lb/>
have a nice display of flowers,<lb/>
We have a nice Cottage with front<lb/>
and back porch which makes it<lb/>
fine as I get out <hi>doors</hi> a lot,<lb/>
and plenty of <hi>room</hi>, and we can<lb/>
watch boats go &amp; come as the <hi>Pier</hi><lb/>
is right near Hospital, If it were<lb/>
not for the &ldquo;Noisy trains&rdquo; running<lb/>
right back of Hospital this would<lb/>
be a Beautiful <hi>place</hi>, But of course<lb/>
the noise &amp; smoke from the trains<lb/>
make it a little disagreeable, But<lb/>
We try and make the best of <hi>it</hi>,<lb/>
This is a very dreary rainy day<lb/>
so very gloomy out,</p>
<pb n="6" id="f00809006"/>
<p>I <hi>do</hi> hope this will find you<lb/>
and all quite <hi>well</hi>, With Kind<lb/>
Regards &amp; Love, I Remain</p>
