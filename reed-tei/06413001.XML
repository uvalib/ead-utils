<p>Truby tries to figure out from a photograph the exact room in which Reed died in Washington, D.C. Knowing that the Lazear notebook would answer very important questions regarding Reed's Preliminary Report, he also discusses various ways to get it from the Carroll family.</p>

<salute>Dear Col. Hench.</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am sorry I have been so<lb/>
long in answering your letter of Dec. 19,<lb/>
but I could not get the info. you<lb/>
wanted from Mrs Gilhus until she had<lb/>
time to get her affairs partly settled.</p>
<p>I had a nice phone conversation<lb/>
with her yesterday and she will look<lb/>
for the photos Gilhus showed me a couple<lb/>
of days before his death. They are more important<lb/>
to you than the small album. The letter you<lb/>
can keep. I will return it soon with<lb/>
comments on things I know about.</p>
<p>We have been busy &amp; very gay throughout<lb/>
the holiday season. My son Jack flew in<lb/>
from Honolulu. Mrs Truby, Elizabeth and I<lb/>
were going out to a New Year's eve party<lb/>
and were going down in our Elevator<lb/>
to take a taxi. At the lobby floor I opened<lb/>
the door and there stood Jack. Of course<lb/>
he was astounded to see us going out and<lb/>
we were just as much surprised. After<lb/>
leaving his baggage in our apt. he went with<lb/>
us to the party and after that he was<lb/>
taken by some of his friends to a big deb.<lb/>
affair at the St. Frances. Home at 4 a.m.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06413002"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
That is the way it went while he<lb/>
was here. He was in Honolulu on<lb/>
the Tokyo swimming team and made<lb/>
a 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> place, which pleased him greatly<lb/>
as he was not in training. When the races<lb/>
were over he hopped a clipper for home here.<lb/>
He should <del>be</del><add>now be</add>, in Tokyo <del>about now</del> <add>again</add>.</p>
<p>Thanks for the photos of the W. R. Memorial<lb/>
Bd. They are good, but you should have<lb/>
been included. I guess that I am the only<lb/>
Ex. member living. I consider you<lb/>
a first class choice for membership<lb/>
as nearly all the others are getting quite<lb/>
feeble and many changes will occur<lb/>
in the next few yrs.</p>
<p>I can't give you any info. re the<lb/>
apt. house on 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>st. where Reed &amp; Kean<lb/>
lived in 1902. But the Reed's are probably<lb/>
right in their statment about which<lb/>
apt they occupied.</p>
<p>The photo of the former &ldquo;U.S.A. General<lb/>
Hospital&rdquo; at Washington Bks. is confusing<lb/>
in that the porches have been screened and it is<lb/>
not a front view. Besides I can't understand<lb/>
the building at the far end. See photo incl.<lb/>
I could show you the exact room if I were<lb/>
there. I may go east to way 50<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> med. Runion<lb/>
of my Class in June. Prehaps you can be there<lb/>
at that time too and we could investigate various<lb/>
things. By the way I have written Kean &amp; Ireland<lb/>
and suggested that the S.G. try to get Carroll<lb/>
to give Dr. Carroll's books &amp; papers to the Library.<lb/>
George Carroll may be having delusions of<lb/>
<del>possible</del> persecution because his father had<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06413003"/>
3<lb/>
things that belonged to the Govt. If he<lb/>
were properly approached, and all fear<lb/>
driven out of his head, he might consent<lb/>
to give the things to the Library. Of course<lb/>
it should be stressed that they would be in<lb/>
Dr Carroll's special space and displayed<lb/>
in his honor. He might even be bribed to do<lb/>
this with his estimate of the value of the things.<lb/>
In the first talk with Carroll, Lazear's notebook<lb/>
would not have to be mentioned and he might<lb/>
be off guard and amenable to reason.</p>
<p>I am especially anxious for you to get<lb/>
that notebook for I am so certain that<lb/>
my statements about it are correct. Reed<lb/>
depended so much on the dates in it<lb/>
when writing the preliminary report; and<lb/>
of all the things in my book I am most<lb/>
anxious to have my notebook story confirmed.</p>
<p>Have you read M.B. Grosvenor's article<lb/>
on Cuba in the Jan. number of the National<lb/>
Geographic Mag.? I was much interested<lb/>
since I have been over most of that ground.<lb/>
He shows pictures of some of the places in<lb/>
Trinadad which I visited. They <hi>were all deserted</hi><lb/>
in 1900 but he did not mention that.</p>
<p>I think that plate XVII P.40 shows the one<lb/>
that I went through. It still looks badly<lb/>
worn &amp; weather beaten. <hi>Soleded</hi> (p. 30) was<lb/>
about 12 miles from Rowell Bks. and Mr Atkins<lb/>
used to have us over there frequently for week<lb/>
ends. He was a principal stockholder of the sugar<lb/>

AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
<del>Albert E. Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco 18, California</del><lb/>
Central at Soledad and spent his winters<lb/>
there. He appreciated the value of U.S. troops<lb/>
so near him and did his best to<lb/>
show his <del>appreciation</del> gratitude. We<lb/>
were royally entertained. It was just<lb/>
a nice horseback ride from our post.</p>
<p>What a great amount of time you must<lb/>
have put on the <hi>Lazear family history</hi>.<lb/>
It is fine but I can't add a thing except<lb/>
about the funeral of Lazear <add>which</add> took place<lb/>
&ldquo;the next day&rdquo; (Sept. 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, p.m.) I am<lb/>
returning <del>it herewith</del>, under separate cover</p>
<p>I have had a letter from Lampson and<lb/>
he promises to stop in here when it<lb/>
is possible to do so.</p>
<p>You asked for Col Richard La Garde's<lb/>
address. Here it is.</p>
<p>Highlandstone Farm<lb/>
Rockville</p>
<p>Route 2. Md.</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>I don't know where his office is now.</p>
<p>Can't you find out from Admiral Stitt<lb/>
where Dr. Carter's old papers &amp; letters are?<lb/>
Some from Reed might be important.</p>
<p>Muscles in my arm are still quite<lb/>
spastic at times and that accounts for<lb/>
the messy places in this letter.</p>
<p>Hope you are all well Best wishes<lb/>
from all the Trubys.</p>
