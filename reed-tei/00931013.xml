<salute>My dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is some time since I last wrote you, and if<lb/>
I am not mistaken I have two unanswered letters since that time. One<lb/>
is the one you wrote in which you enclosed copy of the letter to Miss<lb/>
Read about the Chanchamayo Valley and the outside zone for our campa-<lb/>
ign. As things are now it is too late to discuss what further we are<lb/>
to do because yesterday I stopped all work in the field in all De-<lb/>
partments, and we now consider our task finished, with the exception<lb/>
of compiling our data. This I assume is good news to you. I feel cer-<lb/>
tain that the thing is done and I believe well done. It is a great<lb/>
relief to be able to think and feel that way after almost three<lb/>
years of struggle with the pesky thing. Naturally if I had known as<lb/>
much about it when I commenced as I do now we probably would have<lb/>
gotten through very much sooner.</p>
<p>I expect to keep Mr. Guldstarnd and two of the clerks at<lb/>
work until about the 15th of June getting all the accounts well<lb/>
worked up and a resume of statistical data on the work in such<lb/>
shape that I can write up the report in proper manner. From all<lb/>
indications our figures on the different lines of our work all<lb/>
pass the one million mark. The total number of house visits seems to<lb/>
be somewhere about a million and a half, the container inspections<lb/>
about twice that number and the total number of fish distributed<lb/>
will also pass the one million mark. I think it will be work while<lb/>
for the historical records of this campaign to get all this properly<lb/>

tabulated. I have a curiosity to know the unit cost in the work<lb/>
done in this campaign.</p>
<p>The total amount of funds from the International Health<lb/>
Board is a little less than $110,000.00, and that from the Govern-<lb/>
ment about Lp. 4000.00. I expect to have all returns in by the end<lb/>
of the month of May when in a few days we<del>l</del> will get up the final<lb/>
statement for the Comptroller of the Rockefeller Foundation and for<lb/>
the Government of Peru. In all I have drawn chekcs for about $115,000,<lb/>
but I have a balance on hand in pounds and some in dollars from what<lb/>
the Government recently paid me, which brings the total down to less<lb/>
than $110,000,</p>
<p>And in speaking of money I wish to say that they other <unclear><del>a</del></unclear><lb/>
day I cabled to the New York Office for Miss Read to inform you that<lb/>
the exchange was rising and for you to turn your receipts over to the<lb/>
bank in New York with authotity for me to convert the money your have<lb/>
here at such a time as we shall find the exchange favourable, which<lb/>
I think may come soon. The bankers expect the exchange to go up to<lb/>
about four soon and if it does that would be the time to convert what<lb/>
you have on deposit here. The present rise in the exchange is due to<lb/>
the renewed cotton shipping, and as the shipping will be only a tem-<lb/>
porary measure it is also thought that the rise in the exchange will<lb/>
only last for a short time, hence your money should be converted as<lb/>
soon as one can be sure that you are not going to lose on what you<lb/>
originally deposited.</p>
<p>May 23.</p>
<p>I started this letter Sunday but was interrupted.<lb/>
Today I have cabled the International Health Board that I closed<lb/>
all Campaign work on the 20th, and that I expected to have all the<lb/>
statistical data collected by June 15, and that I was making an<lb/>
announcement in the daily press. I thought that the matter of</p>
