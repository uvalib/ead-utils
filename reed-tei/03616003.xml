<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Dr. Armstrong has asked me to reply to your letter of<lb/>
August 28th since I am one of the authors of the Health Heroes booklet on<lb/>
Walter Reed and also of <hi>Health Through the Ages</hi>. Moreover, I had quite a<lb/>
little to do with the preparation of the filmstrip on Walter Reed. In<lb/>
the preparation of the filmstrip we had considerable assistance from Mrs.<lb/>
Walter Reed who loaned us the photographs in her collection. Since this<lb/>
filmstrip was made in 1927, I do not remember exactly which of the pic-<lb/>
tures came from Mrs. Reed. I presume, however, that the ones showing Dr.<lb/>
Reed in boyhood came originally from her. I have not seen or heard from<lb/>
Mrs. Reed for a long time. Her summer address used to be Blue Ridge Summit,<lb/>
Pa., and in the winter she resided at The Burlington, Vermont Avenue at<lb/>
Thomas Circle, Washington, D. C. It is possible that you may already be<lb/>
in touch with Mrs. Reed if she is still alive. I have never seen a notice<lb/>
of her death.</p>
<p>I do not believe that an author may be permitted a little<lb/>
license when teaching the public, if this license includes the use of cir-<lb/>
cumstantial inaccuracies. With no thought of self-vindication, but only<lb/>
because I believe you would like to know my sources, I am going to take up<lb/>
the points you describe as &ldquo;historical errors.&rdquo; The drawing of Camp Lazear<lb/>
on page 15 is an actual tracing of the photograph facing page 154 of Kelly's<lb/>
<hi>Walter Reed and Yellow Fever</hi>. What you have taken to be high mountains is<lb/>
our artist's conception of clouds. The dots to the left perhaps might be<lb/>
construed as a flight of birds, although I am not sure of this. I suppose<lb/>
the artist added these touches to dress up what seemed to him to be a par-<lb/>
ticularly flat and drab-looking picture. What you have taken to be a river<lb/>
is a path. I offer the same explanation for what appears to be a river in<lb/>
the drawing on page 17. This is an exact tracing of the photograph facing<lb/>
page 164 of Kelly's book. If you will examine the latter again, you will<lb/>
notice a path which appears to go slightly uphill behind the fomites building.<lb/>
This path in our drawing is colored yellow and we have a man walking along it.<lb/>
The yellow strip in the background was put in, I presume, to add a touch of<lb/>
color. I, too, have visited the <hi>site of Camp Lazear</hi> and can add my testimony<lb/>
to the fact that it is definitely flat.</p>
<p>She<lb/>
isnt<lb/>
talking<lb/>
about the<lb/>
same photos<lb/>
I am<lb/>
I referred<lb/>

<p>Dr. Philip S. Hench</p>
<p>September 5, 1940</p>
<p>In regard to the diagram on page 21 and the accompanying<lb/>
text on pages 19 and 20, the facts on which they are based are to be found<lb/>
in an article by W. C. Gorgas, then Colonel of the Medical Corps, U. S.<lb/>
Army, entitled &ldquo;A Few General Directions with Regard to Destroying<lb/>
Mosquitoes, Particularly the Yellow Fever Mosquito.&rdquo; This article is<lb/>
Part V (the last section) in <hi>Yellow Fever - A Compilation of Various<lb/>
Publications</hi>, Senate Document #822. From your letter I presume that you<lb/>
have this compilation. The passage from the Gorgas article is on page 243,<lb/>
a copy of which I am enclosing for ready reference. It is true that this<lb/>
account of the experiment differs in some of the details from that given<lb/>
by Dr. Reed in his address, entitled &ldquo;The Propagation of Yellow Fever -<lb/>
Observations Based on Recent Researches,&rdquo; pages 99-100 in the Senate<lb/>
Document cited above, and also the account given by Dr. Carroll in &ldquo;Yellow<lb/>
Fever: A Popular Lecture,&rdquo; on pages 210 and 211 of that Document. The<lb/>
Gorgas account was, however, checked with those of Dr. Reed and Dr. Carroll<lb/>
and one or two seeming discrepancies rectified, for example, you will<lb/>
remember that Dr. Reed states (on page 99) that on the opposite side of<lb/>
the screen (from Moran) were <hi>two &ldquo;controls&rdquo; and one other non-immune</hi>. This<lb/>
accounts for the fact that there are <hi>three figures in the left box</hi> of the<lb/>
second part of the diagram on page 21 of the <hi>Walter Reed</hi> booklet. The<lb/>
Gorgas story was so clear cut that I used it for the sake of clarity. It<lb/>
is possible, of course, that he was going on hearsay evidence and it might<lb/>
have been better for me to have stuck to the Reed documents exclusively.</p>
<p>But on p 10, 86 &amp; 100 it says<lb/>
2 controls</p>
<p>But <unclear>Gorgas any<lb/>
[?]</unclear> of 2 <unclear>on its</unclear><lb/>
one side<lb/>
Why does she accept<lb/>
Gorgas in the one matter<lb/>
&amp; not the other.</p>
<p>It has been a great pleasure to us to supply you with material<lb/>
for your address and I sincerely hope that you will call on us again if we can<lb/>
be of service.</p>
