<salute>My dear Ladies:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Please permit me to send you my sincerest Christmas wishes.</p>
<p>When I visited you last year, you had run out of the Walter<lb/>
Reed stamps and regretted that you did not have more. You may remember<lb/>
that my mother, 79 years old, has gotten considerable pleasure in recent<lb/>
years in collecting American stamps. Thinking that you might like to<lb/>
have some more of the Walter Reed stamps, she and I have been collecting<lb/>
a few, which we send you with our best wishes. I must, regretfully, in-<lb/>
form you that about a week ago mother became seriously ill and is now in<lb/>
a critical condition. In all likelihood, I will leave here tomorrow to<lb/>
go to Rochester to be with her.</p>
<p>I enclose a picture of my little boy. Don't you admit that he<lb/>
is very cute and very sturdy? I have only seen him about three times in<lb/>
his life and it is very distressing to me to be away from my family so<lb/>
much. As the wife and mother <del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> of a soldier, you know exactly<lb/>
what that means.</p>
<p>When I visited you, you were very kind to lend me a collection<lb/>
of letters and photographs of Major Reed. I have been studying them very<lb/>
carefully in the limited time at my disposal. I have guarded them very<lb/>
carefully and at the times when I have left town. I have placed them in<lb/>
a safety deposit box of the bank vault. One of the photographs which you<lb/>
loaned me, I had copied in order to send copies to some of the yellow<lb/>
fever survivors, in the hope that we might identify them more clearly in<lb/>
the photograph. General Truby seems to think that Major Reed may be the<lb/>
figure in the back row, second from the right. He is not in uniform; he<lb/>
has on a derby hat, dark coat and vest, and white pants. I enclose a copy<lb/>
of General Truby's letter and would be most grateful if you would tell me<lb/>
if Major Reed is this figure. I don't expect to be home more than a<lb/>
couple of weeks. My home address is 517 Fourth Street, S. W., Rochester,<lb/>
Minnesota, but I have no doubt that in your Christmas rush, you would<lb/>
probably prefer to write me here after I return.</p>
