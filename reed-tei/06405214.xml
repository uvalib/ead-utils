Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your very nice letter of July 29th was duly received, and<lb/>
I was pleased that the old photo of 2nd Div. Hosp. 7th Army<lb/>
Corps was received with such enthsiasm.</p>
<p>I regret to have to admit that my personal recollections<lb/>
in connection with the fight on yellow fever at the time<lb/>
amounts to practically nothing; I only remember a few hos-<lb/>
pital corps men bragging about being &ldquo;immunes&rdquo;; they were<lb/>
detailed to nurse yellow fever patients accross the road<lb/>
and considered themselves somewhat superior.</p>
<p>General Truby insisted the other night (at Gen. Hillman's<lb/>
farewell party at LGH) that I should give you any clue-<lb/>
no matter how insignificant it might appear to me- that<lb/>
might assist you in your work. As I returned to the States<lb/>
late in April, 1899, they are very slim. However, during the<lb/>
past few years I have met people who served there during<lb/>
the period in question. Firstly, there is Dr. Ira C. Brown,<lb/>
who as major of Volunteers served as commanding officer of<lb/>
the hospital while I was stationed there. He told me that<lb/>
he had been sanitary inspector of schools in Seattle since<lb/>
- oh, many years anyway. If he is still alive he should<lb/>
be able to furnish much light on the subject.</p>
<p>Then there were a couple nurses, wh<del>l</del><add>o</add>se names I do not recol-<lb/>
lect but might be traced. One was chief nurse at the Ancon<lb/>
(now Gorgas) Hospital. Wh<del>a</del><add>e</add>n I left there in 1927 she told<lb/>
me that she was to retire soon and expected to spend the rest<lb/>
of her days in Jamaica, BWI.--- The other one I met in<lb/>
Washington D.C. 1934 or 5; she had just been elected presi-<lb/>
dent of the Daughters of the Confederacy. Both had served<lb/>
at the 2nd Div. Hosp.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clarence Manly gave me a book of snaps from Cuba (98-99)<lb/>
when the colonel passed on a few years ago. He was a dashing<lb/>
young contract doctor at that time, but I had the provilege<lb/>
of serving under him at Fort Benning and later here in SF.<lb/>
I note that there are some pictures of the hospital in the<lb/>
middle of the book. I am sending them to you for what they<lb/>
may be worth.</p>
<p>Colonel Alexander Stark died many years ago, but his wife is<lb/>
still living in Washington, DC. She must have been down there<lb/>
at the time. General Truby's book has a picture of her sons<lb/>
in a goat cart tied underneath a tree outside the administr-<lb/>
tion tent. The elder one, Alec, was recently retired as B.G.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06405215"/>
Dr. Hench &nbsp;&nbsp; -2- &nbsp;&nbsp; 20 Nov. 46<lb/>
Young Col. Tom is still with Gen. Mc.Arthur, or maybe in<lb/>
the P.I's. Incidentally, they were both born the same year.</p>
<p>Those nice wooden buildings in the foreground were built by<lb/>
the 2nd Engineers. There were some choice sleeping quarters <unclear>u</unclear><lb/>
underneath some of them for which we fought before we got<lb/>
<del>y</del><add>t</add>ents to sleep in. A tall wooden scaffold was erected<lb/>
for the purpose of taking the Picture. Messes and sinks<lb/>
were farther down the hill. and we passed the wooden build-<lb/>
ings several times a day. The SURGERY shack shows only the<lb/>
back side in the picture. The main sign was on the other<lb/>
side and proclaimed it to be &ldquo;surgery.&rdquo; The first patient,<lb/>
I believe, was a corps-man, who had been caught in a compro-<lb/>
mising position by a husband, who did a clean job of hacking<lb/>
his back and fanny with a machete. The poor lad found out<lb/>
that the ladies were not so free and easy as some one had told<lb/>
him. Another patient, about the same time, was an orderly<lb/>
who had shot himself in the belly while cleaning an officer's<lb/>
pistol. I am quite certain that Gen Kean (then major K.)<lb/>
operated on both of these two men. I am sure that the front<lb/>
end of the building had the sign &ldquo;SURGERY&rdquo; over the door, and<lb/>
quite sure that a somewhat smaller one was nailed over the<lb/>
rear door- the one that appears in the picture. It was indeed<lb/>
<add>&ldquo;</add>Major Kean's Workshop!<add>&rdquo;</add></p>
<p>A road ran back of the tents on the right hand side; it went<lb/>
between Quemados and <del>???</del><add>Mananao</add> The 1st Missouri had a guard<lb/>
company near that road. The yellow fever tents were farther<lb/>
down- out of the picture on the right. The nurses tents<lb/>
were upper left.</p>

<salute>With best wishes I remain<lb/>
sincerely yours<add>,</add></salute>
