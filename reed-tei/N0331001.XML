Yellow Fever To<lb/>
Be Given Public</hi></p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>BY DOLLY DALRYMPLE</p>
<p>MISS LAURA ARMISTEAD CAR-<lb/>
TER, daughter of Dr. Henry<lb/>
Rose Carter, Virginian, the man<lb/>
who, isolated in a tiny quarantine<lb/>
station of Ship Island, Gulf of Mex-<lb/>
ico, experiencing with his young<lb/>
wife and children the sordid hard<lb/>
conditions of life, more of the sea<lb/>
than the land, depending upon highly<lb/>
irregular and infrequent communi-<lb/>
cation with the mainland for sup-<lb/>
plies and mail, originated the mod-<lb/>
ern quarantine system and laid the <lb/>
foundations of the work that was to<lb/>
rid most of the world of the dread<lb/>
scourge of yellow fever, is a visitor<lb/>
to her brother, Dr. Henry Rose Car-<lb/>
ter, III, and his gifted wife, Mel-<lb/>
son Barfield Carter, for the Winter.</p>
<p>Miss Carter brings with her a<lb/>
background of beauty and culture<lb/>
her exquisite personality so refined<lb/>
and so gracious, exemplifying the<lb/>
distinguished ancestry which is hers,<lb/>
and to which she is such an orna-<lb/>
ment.</p>
<p>The author of several delightful<lb/>
books, among them a volume of<lb/>
poems, entitled &ldquo;Wind and Blue<lb/>
Water,&rdquo; Miss Carter's most recent<lb/>
efforts have been centered upon her<lb/>
task of serving as historian for her<lb/>
late father, Dr. Carter, assistant<lb/>
surgeon general, U. S. Health Serv-<lb/>
ice, in preparing his data on &ldquo;Yel-<lb/>
low Fever, An Epidemiological and<lb/>
Historical Study of its place of<lb/>
Origin&rdquo; for publication in collabo-<lb/>
ration with Dr. Wade Hampton<lb/>
Frost, the book being just recently<lb/>
off the press (1931).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>THE task while a difficult one,<lb/>
has been a labor of love with<lb/>
this cultured young woman,<lb/>
who was her father's constant com-<lb/>
panion and &ldquo;chum&rdquo; during all her<lb/>
childhood days, extending even unto<lb/>
the time of his passing.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter's work was always<lb/>
shared and appreciated by his fam-<lb/>
ily, who followed him from one<lb/>
place to another, during the experi-<lb/>
mental stage he was engaged in, of<lb/>
finding the cause and prevention of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>In charge of infected districts in<lb/>
Mississippi and Louisiana, Dr. Car-<lb/>
ter was able to note the progress<lb/>
and infection of the disease from one<lb/>
farm to another.</p>
<p>He made a record of his obser-<lb/>
vations at this time, which was of<lb/>
great value to Walter Reed, in the<lb/>
latter's work on yellow fever and of<lb/>
Dr. Carter's work, Walter Reed<lb/>
said: &ldquo;His work did more to im-<lb/>
press me with the importance of an<lb/>
intermediate host in yellow fever<lb/>
than everything else that had been<lb/>
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In recognition of Dr. Carter's<lb/>
training and his knowledge of yel-<lb/>
low fever, he was asked to organize<lb/>
a quarantine service in the Panama<lb/>
Zone, in 1904. With Gen. Gorgas and<lb/>
<hi>Walter Reed</hi>, he went down to &ldquo;clean<lb/>
up&rdquo; the Isthmus, and the conditions<lb/>
under which he first worked were<lb/>
little short of primitive. There were<lb/>
no lamps, and only a few candles,<lb/>
one to every four sleeping rooms;<lb/>
the food was wretched and there<lb/>
was no water supply.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>AND thereby hangs the tale of<lb/>
yellow fever in Panama, for<lb/>
Miss Carter tells interestingly<lb/>
of how a dishpan outside the <unclear>cook's</unclear><lb/>
quarters nearly caused the death of<lb/>
the entire personnel of a battleship<lb/>
because it became a breeding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recall,&rdquo; Miss Carter<unclear>,</unclear> continued,<lb/>
&ldquo;how I used to wait for my father<lb/>
on the steps of the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Hospital to the great dismay of the<lb/>
Panamanians, who were sure that I<lb/>
would soon become an &lsquo;angel.&rsquo; What<lb/>
they did not understand then, was<lb/>
that the method was not to concen-<lb/>
trate on the isolation of the patient,<lb/>
from other persons, but to isolate<lb/>
him from the mosquito, and to ex-<lb/>
terminate these insects so they could<lb/>
not become hosts to the yellow fever<lb/>
organism, and thus spread the dis-<lb/>
ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was this devoted daughter who<lb/>
did the honors socially for her fa-<lb/>
ther when her mother's ill health<lb/>
prevented her from engaging in such<lb/>
activities, and who assisted him in<lb/>
the last great task of his colorful<lb/>
life of service to mankind.</p>
<p>After years spent in Central and<lb/>
South America, combating the dread<lb/>
disease, the Rockefeller Foundation<lb/>
asked him to write a history of yel-<lb/>
low fever. He was known to be the<lb/>
only man who could do it, both be-<lb/>
cause of his experience, and because<lb/>
his vast fund of information in-<lb/>
cluded a knowledge of many lan-<lb/>
guages, in which the first records of<lb/>
disease were written. These com-<lb/>
prised the Portuguese, Spanish, Ital-<lb/>
ian, French, the Maya Mss., Mexican<lb/>
hieroglyphics and the Latin written<lb/>
by the priests during the early ex-<lb/>
plorations in America.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>IT WAS of this notable publica-<lb/>
tion. &ldquo;Yellow Fever an Epidemio-<lb/>
logical and Historical Study of its<lb/>
Places and Origin&rdquo; that Miss Carter<lb/>
and Dr. Frost prepared for publica-<lb/>
tion after Dr. Carter's death, that<lb/>
we talked to Miss Carter about the<lb/>
other week when we had the pleas-<lb/>
ure of meeting her and hearing of<lb/>
her colorful life and achievements.</p>
<p>Said she: &ldquo;On the day of his re-<lb/>
turn from Peru (where, as sanitary<lb/>
advisor of the Peruvian government,<lb/>
he had just stamped out an epidemic<lb/>
of yellow fever in the northern part<lb/>
of that country). My father was<lb/>
asked, by the Rockefeller Founda-<lb/>
tion to write a history of yellow fe-<lb/>
ver. His health was much broken<lb/>
and he replied that he would almost<lb/>
certainly die before the completion<lb/>
of such a work. Realizing its impor-<lb/>
tance, however, he added that if he<lb/>
found he could plan the book in sec-<lb/>
tions, &lsquo;like a flight of steps,&rsquo; each<lb/>
subdivision being complete in itself,<lb/>
so that whoever came after him<lb/>
could go on from where he left off,<lb/>
he would undertake the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was able to so plan the book<lb/>
and began work shortly thereafter<lb/>
(early in 1922). After several severe<lb/>
attacks of angina, the following Sum-<lb/>
mer, he realized that he would have<lb/>
even less time to give to the work<lb/>
than he had anticipated. He there-<lb/>
fore devoted all his efforts to finish-<lb/>
ing during his lifetime a section<lb/>
which should be complete in itself--<lb/>
the early history of yellow fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the book which now is pre-<lb/>
sented to the public. Even this was<lb/>
completed only by working through-<lb/>
out long illnesses, the last year of<lb/>
his life he was continuously confined<lb/>
to his bed. Yet knowing that any of<lb/>
the frequent interruptions to his<lb/>
work might be the final one, in con-<lb/>
stant discomfort, in almost constant<lb/>
pain his energy and enthusiasm were<lb/>
unabated and he worked on, dictating<lb/>
towards the last (when too weak to<lb/>
write) until within five hours of the<lb/>
beginning of his last illness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he had the final satisfaction<lb/>
of knowing that his race against<lb/>
time was won! By a narrow margin,<lb/>
it is true, and with some legacies of<lb/>
further work to others, before the<lb/>
book, as he had planned it could be<lb/>
given to the world. However, that<lb/>
part of the work which no one but<lb/>
he could have done, he did! It was<lb/>
significant of the spirit in which the<lb/>
book was written and of the appre-<lb/>
ciation of the fact by others, that<lb/>
when the news of his last illness<lb/>
became known, out of the stream of<lb/>
messages that poured in from his<lb/>
confreres in all parts of the world,<lb/>
all sent congratulations that he had<lb/>
reached his goal! Not one man sent<lb/>
a message of condolence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>GAL 2--DOLLY SUN MAG SEC--<lb/>
SUNDAY NOV. 29--</p>
<p>------------------------------------</p>
<p>AN INTERPOLATION just here<lb/>
suggests itself; that this emi-<lb/>
nent physician so unselfish and<lb/>
so devoted to his work, cared not to<lb/>
live except his task be accomplished,<lb/>
like the old Roman general who ex-<lb/>
claimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not necessary that I reach<lb/>
Pelusium, it is not necessary that I<lb/>
live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking up the conversation once<lb/>
more Miss Carter said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the time of my father's death<lb/>
in 1925, the present book had been<lb/>
fully drafted in its present scope and<lb/>
content and the text completed<lb/>
(though not revised), with the excep-<lb/>
tion of the section on Africa. This<lb/>
African section had been drafted<lb/>
only roughly with numerous notes,<lb/>
indicating additional references to be<lb/>
consulted, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There remained then, after his<lb/>
death, before sending the MSS, to<lb/>
press:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(a) Further research for the Afri-<lb/>
can section.</item>
<item>(b) The verification of all refer-<lb/>
ences, including those from contem-<lb/>
porary records in Spanish, Portu-<lb/>
guese, French, Italian, Latin, Dutch,<lb/>
Maya, Nahuatl (Aztec), XV and<lb/>
XVI Century English, etc.,</item>
<item>(c) The subsequent compilation of<lb/>
the bibliography from these verified<lb/>
references and, lastly.</item>
<item>(d) The final editing.</item>
</list></p>
<p>It is due to the genius of Dr. Wade<lb/>
Hampton Frost (a genius similar to<lb/>
his own) that this final editing has<lb/>
so closely followed the lines laid<lb/>
down by my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turning to the completed book, as<lb/>
here presented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As stated in the author's preface<lb/>
(fortunately written by my father,<lb/>
when he started work in 1922): &ldquo;It<lb/>
would seem natural, in writing a his-<lb/>
tory of any disease&rsquo; to begin by col-<lb/>
lecting accounts of its occurrence<lb/>
and from them finally to deduce our<lb/>
general principles (the so-called &lsquo;epi-<lb/>
demiology&rsquo; of the disease.) A differ-<lb/>
ent--almost a reversed-order is fol-<lb/>
lowed in the present book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, because certain facts in the<lb/>
epidemiology of yellow fever are es-<lb/>
tablished and definitely known, while<lb/>
the reports of its occurrence (and<lb/>
non-occurrence) are frequently not<lb/>
only unreliable, but erroneous. There-<lb/>
fore &lsquo;by writing the book back-<lb/>
wards,&rsquo; as my father often phrased<lb/>
it: That is, by beginning with a<lb/>
statement of the conditions under<lb/>
which, and only under which, yellow<lb/>
fever can occur, the reader can, him-<lb/>
self test the truth or error of the<lb/>
historical evidence submitted later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>AMONG the many beautiful en-<lb/>
comiums which have been writ-<lb/>
ten about Dr. Carter and his<lb/>
work none is more significant than<lb/>
the editorial by Douglas Freeman, in<lb/>
The Richmond News, 1914, under the<lb/>
heading, &ldquo;Carter, Reed, Gorgas&rdquo; upon<lb/>
the occasion of the meeting of the<lb/>
Southern Medical Association, there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sentiment expressed in the<lb/>
&lsquo;Editorial&rsquo; follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry R. Carter, whose early work<lb/>
made possible the experiments of<lb/>
Walter Reed and the remarkable<lb/>
sanitary conquests of Gorgas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very mention of Reed com-<lb/>
pletes the triumvirate. For while<lb/>
young Gorgas was leading his cow<lb/>
up Fifth Street and young Carter in<lb/>
Hanover County was wondering at<lb/>
war, the Gloucester County preacher's<lb/>
boy was 14 years old, all unconscious<lb/>
of his future fame, and scarcely<lb/>
thinking of medicine as a career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We doubt if modern science re-<lb/>
cords a like example of men of kin-<lb/>
dred sympathy and almost common<lb/>
birth whose labors in the same field<lb/>
of endeavor yielded such notable re-<lb/>
sults. Carter and Reed were native<lb/>
Virginians, Gorgas, as the son of<lb/>
Gen. Josiah Gorgas, passed the for-<lb/>
mative years of his life in this state<lb/>
and is knit to us by ties so<lb/>
close that we always think of him as<lb/>
a Virginian. They never knew one<lb/>
another until manhood, but then they<lb/>
cooperated with splendid comrade-<lb/>
ship in the study of yellow fever--<lb/>
that baffling scourge of the tropics.<lb/>
Dr. Carter worked out the extrinsic<lb/>
period of incubation, Dr. Reed at Co-<lb/>
lumbia Barracks, Quemados, proved<lb/>
the responsibility of the stegomyia<lb/>
fasciata for the carriage of yellow<lb/>
fever; Dr. Gorgas, first at Havana<lb/>
and then at Panama, worked out<lb/>
measures for the prevention of the<lb/>
disease, without which, as all the<lb/>
world knows, the greatest engineer-<lb/>
ing feat of the ages, the completion<lb/>
of the Panama Canal, could not have<lb/>
been accomplished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The commonwealth that boasts<lb/>
great soldiers like Washington, Jack-<lb/>
son and Lee, great jurists like Wythe,<lb/>
Marshall and <unclear>R&ograve;ane</unclear> and great states-<lb/>
men like Jefferson, Madison and<lb/>
Monroe rejoices that she has a claim<lb/>
on three of the greatest benefactors<lb/>
of our day--Carter, Reed and Gor-<lb/>
gas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>------------------------------------</p>
<p>ANOTHER is gleaned from &ldquo;Notes<lb/>
On Dr. Carter's Contributions<lb/>
to Sanitary Science (unpub-<lb/>
lished), by Wade Hampton Frost,<lb/>
prepared at the request of the Rocke-<lb/>
feller Foundation, on Dr. Carter's<lb/>
book. &ldquo;Yellow Fever; An Epidemio-<lb/>
logical and Historical Study of Its<lb/>
Place and Origin,&rdquo; in which Dr. Frost<lb/>
says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, there is his history of<lb/>
yellow fever, which more nearly than<lb/>
any other work shows his full mas-<lb/>
tery of the subject. It is character-<lb/>
istic in its plan, in that he first lays<lb/>
down, from modern knowledge, the<lb/>
physical, biological and social condi-<lb/>
tions which determine the character-<lb/>
istic epidemiology of yellow fever.<lb/>
Then, in the light of these condi-<lb/>
tions, he reviews not the history of<lb/>
yellow fever, but the history of the<lb/>
period, from the earliest records of<lb/>
Western Africa and America to 1648<lb/>
when yellow fever emerges from ob-<lb/>
scurity and becomes recognizable be-<lb/>
yond question. In all that may throw<lb/>
light on yellow fever, as in the old<lb/>
Maya and Aztec records, in the de-<lb/>
tails of losses in military expeditions<lb/>
and colonies, in the analysis of social<lb/>
conditions and commercial develop-<lb/>
ment, in the study of early communi-<lb/>
cation between Africa and America,<lb/>
he has gone back to contemporary<lb/>
records...and his interpretation of<lb/>
the facts with reference to the light<lb/>
which they throw on the presence or<lb/>
absence of yellow fever is the most<lb/>
delightful epidemiological analysis<lb/>
that I have ever followed. Merely as<lb/>
an historical research his history of<lb/>
yellow fever would be a credit to an<lb/>
historian. As a retrospective study in<lb/>
epidemiology it is altogether unique<lb/>
and, I believe, will be final as to the<lb/>
principal questions which he dis-<lb/>
cusses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>LAURA CARTER was the first<lb/>
girl on the Isthmus of Panama<lb/>
when she went with her father<lb/>
there; later came Margaret Gillick,<lb/>
the lovely Mrs. Lloyd Noland, wife of<lb/>
Birmingham's distinguished physi-<lb/>
cian; and also Aileen Gorgas, the<lb/>
daughter of the late Gen. Gorgas.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter had been to Cuba with<lb/>
Gen. Gorgas previously, and was di-<lb/>
rector of hospitals after the opening<lb/>
of the quarantine station on the<lb/>
isthmus. He acted for Gen. Gorgas<lb/>
when things prevented the general<lb/>
from doing so, and in all things stood<lb/>
shoulder to shoulder with Gorgas in<lb/>
all of his great work in Panama.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The object was,&rdquo; said Miss Carter,<lb/>
in speaking of this period, &ldquo;to clean<lb/>
up Panama before the digging of the<lb/>
canal; to clear out yellow fever and<lb/>
control malaria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might say that I was brought<lb/>
up under the &lsquo;yellow flag&rsquo; for my life<lb/>
began with our residence on Chande-<lb/>
leur Island and the Dry Tortugas in<lb/>
the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we returned from Panama<lb/>
in 1909, my father later was ordered<lb/>
to Europe, on account of the cholera<lb/>
epidemic (1912) to make regulations<lb/>
which would protect the U. S. with as<lb/>
little interference with commerce as<lb/>
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Carter received many flatter-<lb/>
ing offers from universities and col-<lb/>
leges to become a member of their<lb/>
faculty; but these he declined, and<lb/>
Miss Carter, at this time became her<lb/>
father's secretary and collaborator.</p>
<p>During the World War she was<lb/>
&ldquo;a dollar a year man,&rdquo; Dr. Carter<lb/>
being in charge of malarial control<lb/>
of all training camps east of the<lb/>
Rockies, and of the large industrial<lb/>
plants making war materials.</p>
<p>For two years Miss Carter worked<lb/>
during the war, and a year after the<lb/>
war she worked with her father on<lb/>
malarial control for the U. S. Public<lb/>
Health Service. Later, in South<lb/>
America, father and daughter worked<lb/>
together under the Rockefeller Foun-<lb/>
dation, and Dr. Carter remained in<lb/>
Peru, as sanitary advisor to the<lb/>
Peruvian government. Then the<lb/>
Rockefeller Foundation asked him to<lb/>
write his book on &lsquo;yellow fever,&rsquo;<lb/>
which Miss Carter and Dr. Frost<lb/>
prepared for publication.</p>
<p>During this period Dr. Carter and<lb/>
his daughter also collaborated on<lb/>
other interesting books, among them<lb/>
&ldquo;The Malaria Catechism,&rdquo; taught in<lb/>
schools throughout the malarial sec-<lb/>
tion of the South, and its Spanish<lb/>
translation in Latin America. It is<lb/>
said to have the widest circulation<lb/>
of any government publication.</p>
<p>Miss Carter's volume of poems,<lb/>
&ldquo;Wind and Blue Water,&rdquo; is charm-<lb/>
ing. It was inspired by travel in the<lb/>
tropics where &ldquo;the sparkle and space<lb/>
and color and fresh winds&rdquo; make the<lb/>
soul &ldquo;drunk with rapture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this the volume is a group of<lb/>
war poems touching upon events in<lb/>
the World War. These were written<lb/>
at a dinner party at which an of-<lb/>
ficer, in speaking of women, said<lb/>
that when in doubt of a beloved<lb/>
woman's affection, a man should<lb/>
knock boldly at her door (meta-<lb/>
phorically speaking, of course), and<lb/>
if no response was forthcoming, he<lb/>
should leave at once and never re-<lb/>
turn.</p>
<p>Miss Carter listened, and with her<lb/>
knowledge of feminine psychology,<lb/>
promptly wrote the charming poem<lb/>
which ends with these prophetic<lb/>
lines:</p>
<p>Fearful of so much joy<lb/>
You turned away;<lb/>
She cannot love if<lb/>
She can thus delay;<lb/>
And now you stand no more<lb/>
Before my door--<lb/>
Ah me--had you but knocked<lb/>
A moment more.</p>

<p>MISS CARTER'S mother was the<lb/>
famous beauty, Laura Eugenia<lb/>
van Hook, herself a talented<lb/>
writer, and many eminent critics pre-<lb/>
dicted a brilliant literary career for<lb/>
her; but, &ldquo;under the yellow flag&rdquo;<lb/>
her enchanting stories turned into<lb/>
more practical and domestic things<lb/>
and the world was deprived of her<lb/>
talents in that direction.</p>
<p>In her youthful days she conducted<lb/>
a column on the same newspaper<lb/>
with Eugene Field, and her gifts as<lb/>
a musician, linguist, and writer, at-<lb/>
tracted the attention of many dis-<lb/>
tinguished people.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Dr. Carter's book<lb/>
on yellow fever, which his daughter<lb/>
and Dr. Frost have so accurately<lb/>
prepared for publication, has at-<lb/>
tracted, among many others, the<lb/>
League of Nations, which has a com-<lb/>
mittee on quarantine regulations for<lb/>
travel. It is felt that the book will<lb/>
be of great help to the league and to<lb/>
all others in authority, in reaching<lb/>
sound conclusions <unclear>with</unclear> reference to<lb/>
rules, regulations and laws concern-<lb/>
ing this dread disease.</p>
