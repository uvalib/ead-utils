<salute>My dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This will acknowledge receipt of your two letters of February 2nd, one<lb/>
of which enclosed your check for $245.00 for payment for Finlay medallions for<lb/>
the relatives of those who participated in the yellow fever work. It was<lb/>
wonderful of you to offer to pay for the medals to be sent to these various<lb/>
people in the United States.</p>
<p>A number of the members of the Board of the Walter Reed Memorial Association<lb/>
have talked over this matter and we feel very strongly that because of the<lb/>
immense amount of work which you have done in connection with the establishment<lb/>
of this Memorial and its dedication that the Walter Reed Memorial Association<lb/>
should be responsible for payment of the cost of these mdeallions. Several of<lb/>
us have agreed unanimously that this should be done.</p>
<p>I have consulted with Mr. Ireland and he told me that in addition to the<lb/>
money needed for sending Blossom Reed the monthly check of $100 there is in the<lb/>
fund something over $600. In view of that fact, we all agreed that the $245.00<lb/>
referred to above should be taken from that reserve fund.</p>
<p>Mr. Ireland is sending a check to Dr. Nogueira with a covering letter which<lb/>
I have signed, copy of which is enclosed.</p>
<p>I am accordingly returning to you with this letter your personal check for<lb/>
$245.00 which you sent to me.</p>
<p>We all feel that you have done a wonderful thing in bringing to fruition<lb/>
the establishment of Lazear Park.</p>
<p>Hoping to have the pleasure of seeing you next fall at the next annual<lb/>
meeting of the Board and with very best regards, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>

(Dr. Hench, Feb. 11, 1954.)<lb/>
<seg>P. S. Referring to your second letter of February 4th, relative to the part taken<lb/>
by the two ladies who live at the Finca San Jose, Senora Maria Teresa Rojas<lb/>
and Senorita Lidia Cabrere, in bringing to fruition the dedication of Park<lb/>
Lazear and their connection with the help extended Walter Reed in his yellow<lb/>
fever work, I would be delighted to take this matter up with the members of<lb/>
the Board of Managers and we will communicate with you very shortly concerning<lb/>
this matter.<lb/>
J. F. S.<lb/>
J.F.S.<lb/>
P.S. 2. Since dictating this letter I have learned that we are to have the<lb/>
pleasure of seeing you in Washington on February 18th when you are to give<lb/>
a lecture at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Cortisone <del>and</del> preparations<lb/>
and their use in rheumatic conditions.<lb/>
We shall look forward with very great pleasure to seeing you and I trust<lb/>
that it will be possible t take definite action concerning Senora Rojas and<lb/>
Senorita Cabrere at that time.<lb/>
J. F. S.</seg>
