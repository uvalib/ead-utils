<salute>My dear Mr. Moran:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You will be hearing very shortly from Dr. Hutchison, President<lb/>

of Washington and Jefferson. He has been trying to get a personal interview<lb/>
with Mr. Pew. He made a date last week but it had to be cancelled and I understand<lb/>
he is planning to go to Philadelphia to see him this week. I am sure, confidentially,<lb/>
that something will be arranged to help take care of your expenses.</p>
<p>I am delighted to hear from General Kean that you are to be<lb/>
honored by a dinner at the University of Virginia on the twenty-fourth of October.<lb/>
I wish indeed that I could be there, but I am afraid I will have to meet you in<lb/>
Washington, Pennsylvania. In Charlottesville, I sincerely hope that you can meet<lb/>
my brother, Dr. A. L. Hench, who for many years has been Professor of English<lb/>
Literature at the University of Virginia. I am writing him, telling him of your<lb/>
coming. Although your time will probably be taken up largely by the medical men,<lb/>
I hope that you can at least meet my brother and his family.</p>
<p>By separate post, I am sending you a picture of the Lazear<lb/>
Memorial at Washington and Jefferson.</p>
<p>The most important item is that I hope it isn't too late for me to<lb/>
call your attention again to Photograph 17, which I sent to you. The more I study<lb/>
this photograph of Camp Lazear, which shows the various tents and two or three wooden<lb/>
buildings in the background, the more I wonder whether these wooden buildings and<lb/>
the white buildings behind them might not be buildings belonging, not to the camp,<lb/>
but to the San Jose farm. Remember that the Infected Clothing Building number 1<lb/>
faced due south. With this as a guide, place the photograph on the map of the San<lb/>
Jose farm and you will find that the San Jose farm house might be in the background.<lb/>
Will you particularly ask Senora Rojas when you see her if she can identify these<lb/>
other buildings and in particular the white building behind them in the right back-<lb/>
ground? Is it by chance the second floor of the San Jose farm house? I also forgot<lb/>
to ask her whether the farm house has been changed very much in the last fifty years.<lb/>
If the other buildings and the white building do, in fact, belong to the farm<lb/>
it would place Camp Lazear rather nearer to the farm house than our impression was.<lb/>
I know I have asked you to do many favors for me, and I am very anxious to hear from<lb/>
this. My only defense is, as I told you, that you got me into this, and that it<lb/>
is a thing which is dear to your heart.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
