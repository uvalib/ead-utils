<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here is the part of my ms that covers Reed from the Spanish-<lb/>
American War and his typhoid investigation on. I haven't a suffic-<lb/>
iently connected carbon of the rest to send you, because the pub-<lb/>
lished has all but one very chopped up one which I need for editing.<lb/>
I hardly suppose, however, that you are much interested in the<lb/>
first two-thirds - less, anyway, than in the last part.</p>
<p>It has been a mad-house around here for days, with about three<lb/>
people constnatly grinding away on typewriters and asking for<lb/>
drinks, and I picked up a dandy cold from somewhere which made<lb/>
my own personal confusion worse than usual. I have to take the<lb/>
ms to New York Tuesday.</p>
<p>I'll be most grateful if you'll note anything that sounds inap-<lb/>
propriate or unlikely as well as the things that are just plain<lb/>
wrong - there are a couple about which I am doubtful and which I<lb/>
have marked, and there are probably a dozen which slipped by me.<lb/>
One thing that seems queer to me is this: if Carter's tables of<lb/>
his Mississippi observations tipped Reed off to the insect host<lb/>
theory, what was there left for Lazear's note book to explain to<lb/>
him - it sounds as though he needed two tip-offs. Is that right?<lb/>
I'm a bit confused about that, and so accordingly is the ms.<lb/>
If you notice places where the thread of the explanation about<lb/>
the yellow fever experiments becomes confused, I should appreciate<lb/>
it if you would mark it.</p>
<p>Will you return this to me at the following address:<lb/>
Laura Wood<lb/>
c/o Julian Messner, Inc.<lb/>
8 West 40th St. - New York, N. Y.</p>
<p>N. B.</p>
<p>We are supposed to go to press on this the 14th or 16th - I'm not sure<lb/>
which since they told me the 15th - and that's where I'll be. So if<lb/>
you could get it to me <add>by airmail</add> as soon as you find it convenient --- I'm sorry<lb/>
to leave you so little time, but it wasn't until this morning that I<lb/>
finally <del><unclear></unclear></del> had everything typed and assembled and corrected.</p>
<p>I saw Blossom Reed, and she was nice. I picked up several little<lb/>
things from her. Her heart belongs to daddy, all right.</p>
<p>You are so nice to go over this, and I'm terribly sorry to hurl it<lb/>
at you with such haste.</p>
<p>Please remember me to Mrs. Hench.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely -</salute>
