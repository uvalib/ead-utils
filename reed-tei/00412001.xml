<salute>Dear <unclear>Mommy</unclear> Sweitzer-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have <unclear>been</unclear><lb/>
<unclear>thiking</unclear> to thank you for the<lb/>
welcome letter and my beauti-<lb/>
ful corsets- They fit so well<lb/>
and are so comfortable. Even<lb/>
mother has come to the conclusion<lb/>
that, corset are one thing you<lb/>
can't get in California- Please<lb/>
when you write let me know<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00412002"/>
how much I owe you- If I<lb/>
had an idea I should put<lb/>
the check in this letter-<lb/>
I am so glad to have the<lb/>
direction for the sweat as it<lb/>
is for the Doctor who has<lb/>
been so kind to the children<lb/>
I am so glad Peggy is to have<lb/>
another sweater- The lost<lb/>
one is exactly the right size<lb/>
and as she has worn the<lb/>
other two every day they<lb/>
are a little small-</p>
<p>If Houston should be so<lb/>
fortunate as to have an<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00412003"/>
other one I think it would<lb/>
be well to have it a great<lb/>
deal larger than the last<lb/>
one, he grows so fast-<lb/>
You can almost see him<lb/>
growing- He and Peggy both<lb/>
keep me busy they want stories<lb/>
all the time- She can just<lb/>
say tory so cute -- and if you<lb/>
don't tell them loud enough<lb/>
Houston always say, &ldquo;Talk harder&rdquo;<lb/>
for the last month I have<lb/>
taken about all the care<lb/>
of them- The nurse I have<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00412004"/>
had for some time was not<lb/>
well so that she has just<lb/>
come in at times to relieve<lb/>
me- If I only had a little<lb/>
more strength I would<lb/>
not think of being bother<lb/>
with a nurse- It means<lb/>
one more to look out for.<lb/>
The Baby is so cute when you<lb/>
go in her room at night<lb/>
and ask her what is the<lb/>
matter she always says<lb/>
&ldquo;Cryin! bottie!-</p>
<p>I suppose you have heard<lb/>
the Bill for the pension<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00412005"/>
has passed the House &amp;<lb/>
Senate- I had such a de-<lb/>
lightful note from Dr Gilman<lb/>
congratulating me and sending<lb/>
all the letters he had re-<lb/>
ceive about it, thinking I<lb/>
would like to keep them<lb/>
for the children- He also<lb/>
enclosed a clipping in which<lb/>
it said that his remarks<lb/>
about Jess were more en-<lb/>
thusiasticly received than<lb/>
about any one else of<lb/>
whom he spoke.</p>
<p>I should indeed think<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00412006"/>
the trip to Mrs M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Callan<lb/>
would be delightful and<lb/>
just what you needed<lb/>
Her house must seem al-<lb/>
most like home you have<lb/>
known her so long.</p>
<p>Pardon the lead pencil<lb/>
but as I am writing this<lb/>
in bed having retired at<lb/>
my usual hour 7.30 I<lb/>
found a pen to hard to<lb/>
manage- What a dread-<lb/>
ful thing the fire was at<lb/>
Bryn Mawr!-</p>
<pb n="7" id="f00412007"/>
<p>Give my last love to Aunt<lb/>
Kate.- A great deal for yourself<lb/>
from Mabel and the Babies<lb/>
and many thanks for filling<lb/>
a long and much needed<lb/>
want in the corsets</p>
