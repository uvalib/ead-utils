Assistant Surgeon General H. R. Carter,<lb/>
U. S. Marine Hospital,<lb/>
Baltimore, Md.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In reply to your letter of December 11, 1917, I have<lb/>
the following information to give:</p>
<p>After your survey had been completed, it was impossible<lb/>
to secure funds for carrying on anti-malarial work around the<lb/>
Camp in time for the Service to accomplish anything along this<lb/>
line. Major Henry P. Carter had a force of between seven hundred<lb/>
and eight hundred men at work clearing, draining, and ditching<lb/>
the camp area itself, and, knowing that we would be unable to<lb/>
get started for a time, he did not stop strictly at the camp<lb/>
limits but went beyond. He took care of all of the places which<lb/>
you had marked in the immediate vicinity of the camp on the<lb/>
outside. He also cared for the oiling along the concrete road<lb/>
almost to the Petersburg end.</p>
<p>There was no work at all done around the old mill in<lb/>
Ettricks nor in Colonial Heights. In Petersburg, the Health<lb/>
Officer made an attempt at carrying out your suggestions and<lb/>
directions but considerable was left undone. I had so much to<lb/>
do in connection with raising money, organizing a force, and get-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0128026"/>
#2<lb/>
ting things started, that I was not able to keep after the<lb/>
Health Officer all the time.</p>
<p>There was very little malaria among the workmen at the<lb/>
Camp. <del>You</del><add>We</add> never heard of more than five or six cases. In the<lb/>
City of Petersburg, twelve positive smears were diagnosed at the<lb/>
laboratory out of about forty sent in. As you know, the doctors<lb/>
and citizens of Petersburg are of the opinion that malaria does<lb/>
not prevail to any great extent in this vicinity.</p>
<p>I am in receipt of a letter from the Bureau dated<lb/>
October 29, 1917 instructing me to furnish a statement in regard<lb/>
to the present status of the studies of this disease and its<lb/>
eradication in this district, and also an estimate as to the<lb/>
total cost of the work which remains to be done. I immediately<lb/>
get in touch with Major Carter, who was the only officer in this<lb/>
region who could assist me in obtaining this information, and<lb/>
he and I spent two half days in going over the situation. The<lb/>
notes which we made are enclosed herewith. Major Carter and I<lb/>
had arranged to spend an entire day in the field collecti<del>on</del><add>ng</add> addi-<lb/>
tional data, but before this could be done, he was suddenly ordered<lb/>
to Houston, Texas and departed immediately. There is no one<lb/>
around here now who knows anything about anti-malarial measures<lb/>
and it will be exceedingly difficult for me to furnish information<lb/>
which the Bureau desired, as I myself have had absolutely no<lb/>
experience in this line of work.</p>
<p>I hope that this will serve to asnwer some of your<lb/>
questions and that you will let me know if there is anything<lb/>
further which I can give.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>W.F. Draper</signed>
