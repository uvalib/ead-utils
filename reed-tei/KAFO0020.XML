Col. J. Randolph Kean,<lb/>

Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Col. Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your kind letter of March third was duly received, but found me<lb/>
so much occupied with urgent matters that it is only until now that I have<lb/>
had the opportunity of writing you further. The questions I have in mind<lb/>
are doubtless difficult ones for anybody to answer, but I thought possibly<lb/>
you might be in possession of certain information that might permit a re-<lb/>
ply.</p>
<p>In reviewing Dr. Walter Reed's life the very striking thing to<lb/>
me is the fact that at the age of forty or thereabouts he decided to go<lb/>
into Bacteriology and Pathology. It seems likely to me that throughout<lb/>
his medical career up to this time he had certain definite objectives,<lb/>
which circumstances had until then denied him the opportunity of develop-<lb/>
ing. In a brief statement in Dr. Kelly's History of Walter Reed, Welch<lb/>
expressed the opinion that Reed had received his inspiration for scienti-<lb/>
fic work during a period he spent in the Laboratory of Physiology at Johns<lb/>
Hopkins in 1880. Of course, I would like to think that Dr. Reed received<lb/>
at least a part of his inspiration at the University of Virginia, and in<lb/>
going over his teachers here it seems more likely that he received inspir-<lb/>
ation for a scientific career from Dr. James Lawrence Cabell than from any<lb/>
of the other men with whom he had contacts.</p>
<p>It was unusual for a man in clinical work to have elected to<lb/>
study Physiology in 1880 and I have wondered if anyone knows whether it<lb/>
may be true that Dr. Reed resumed the study of Physiology through the for-<lb/>
mer influence of Dr. Cabell. In going over the history of Dr. Reed's<lb/>
life as it is recorded, I have not been able to find that any particular<lb/>
person with whom he came in contact had a very definite influence over<lb/>
his concepts and his life until his work with Welch about 1890 and the<lb/>
brilliant group of young investigators with whom he was associated in<lb/>
Welch's laboratory.</p>
<p>I also have not been able to find out what preparation he had<lb/>
if any for the study of Bacteriology and Pathology when he went to Balti-<lb/>
more in 1890. When he was at the University there was no medical or<lb/>
biological subject in which microscopic work was done and, of course, this<lb/>
was some years before any medical school had a course in Bacteriology.<lb/>
In a recent conversation with Dr. Hume, Dr. Hume told me that he had rea-<lb/>
son to think that Dr. Reed owned a microscope prior to the time he went<lb/>
to Johns Hopkins, but this was rather unusual due to the fact that he had<lb/>
no early training in microscopic work and he had then been stationed at<lb/>
western army posts for a good many years.</p>

<p>I hesitate to impose upon you in view of what you tell me of<lb/>
your physical limitations, but if you could reply in brief to these<lb/>
questions in my mind it would mean a good deal to me.</p>
<p>Understanding from what I have said above the real purport<lb/>
of this letter, if you can add any other facts that would bear upon<lb/>
this I would be greatly obliged to you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
