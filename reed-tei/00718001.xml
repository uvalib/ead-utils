<salute>Dear Mother:</salute>
</opener>
<p>We are in status quo &amp; I <unclear>assume</unclear> likely so to<lb/>
continue. The only ripple on the course of our present life is that<lb/>
the Steward is going to <unclear>Wh. O.</unclear> to have Mand's teeth fixed,<lb/>
&amp; that isn't very exciting save to the participants.</p>
<p>I will have to go to Biloxi, once more this month &amp; I pre-<lb/>
sume only once more, &amp; then the Quarantine. A long hot,<lb/>
insecty &amp; anxious six 1/2 months. However the work<lb/>
this season is slight as compared with that of last,<lb/>
&amp; at present as <hi>nothing</hi>. I rec'd notice last mail that<lb/>
I shall appear before the next examin<del>g</del>ing board.<lb/>
That does not mean immediate promotion unfortu-<lb/>
nately, only that if I pass all right I will be eligi-<lb/>
ble for the next vacancy. I have no idea <hi>when</hi><lb/>
the said Board will meet. I <hi>heard</hi> this month &amp; also<lb/>
heard in June. If <del>relieved</del><add>ordered</add> off now I must be relieved<lb/>

As Pensicola &amp; Apilachicola lay Quarantine<lb/>
<unclear>with</unclear> 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> inst &amp; an officer must be here now.<lb/>
This will probably give me an opportunity to see<lb/>
you this summer as I could doubtless<lb/>
stop a few days on my return I presume<lb/>
the Board will meet in Washington<lb/>
I am ill prepared for a professional examination -<lb/>
especially on the so-called &ldquo;Student Branches,&rdquo; the work<lb/>
here having displaced such knowledge from my mind.<lb/>
But it seems that most stress is laid on Practice of Medicine<lb/>
Surgery &amp; Pathology &amp; those are branches one does not forget.<lb/>
I must say that I wish I could get my promotion soon. I need<lb/>
the increase of salary. Would send L&amp; the children on to Va<lb/>
if I had it in May.</p>
<p>Tell Mary we received the two Scribners &amp; were<lb/>
very glad to get them although I have only read in them<lb/>
Laura's eyes are getting strong, it seems to me to have been<lb/>
a weakened power of accommodation due to strain<lb/>
of a naturally far-sighted eye when very weak.<lb/>
I rec'd a note from my Fla. man, who said that the old<lb/>
trees came through (the freeze) uninjured, but that <del>more</del><add>many</add><lb/>
of those set out in February (&amp; which had not rooted) were<lb/>
killed. He seemed to ascribe the loss as much (or more)<lb/>
to the dry weather as to the cold - as the blossoms were unin-<lb/>
jured on the bearing trees. He promised to write more fully next<lb/>
mail; it (writing) is not easy to him I think.</p>
<p>How is John getting on at school? (or College rather) &amp; when will he be<lb/>
able to leave it? Nine others of us had the grippe same L. &amp; I. I wonder<lb/>
if you would have had it if I had not. I think it doubtful.</p>
<p>We have been pretty near starvation recently (save the steward) I<lb/>
was alone here &amp; could not by myself haul the seine. The fish would not<lb/>
bite &amp; meat was scarce, <unclear>&amp;</unclear> if crabs had not come up we had<lb/>
fared badly</p>
<p>All send love &amp; all-save possibly L. Jr - are to some<lb/>
extent ailing - Henry especially so.</p>
