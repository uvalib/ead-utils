Mr. John R. Bullard<lb/>
P. O. Box 59<lb/>
St. Augustine, Florida<lb/>
</dateline>
<salute>My dear Mr. Bullard:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you so much for sending me a corrected copy of my write-up of<lb/>
your story. I thought Gen. Kean would be interested in it and sent him a copy.<lb/>
He enjoyed reading it. He made a few comments your reaction to which I'd like<lb/>
to know.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. His recollection was that your first attack of malaria was while<lb/>
you were in Havana about 10 days after your departure from Dedham, Massachusetts<lb/>
where your mother was then living. Kean stated that your malaria (the tropical<lb/>
double tertian type) was brought to Dedham by Italian laborers working on a sewer.</item>
<item>2. To your recollection that Kean tried to dissuade you Kean remarked,<lb/>
&ldquo;This is not my memory of the case which is that I rather approved it.&rdquo;</item>
</list></p>
<p>These are the only comments he made except to speak very pleasantly of<lb/>
you and to say that your story seemed quite accurate.</p>
<p>Now let me comment on your corrections. I understand most of them. But<lb/>
you say that &ldquo;On the third day of your illness the Yellow Fever Board came out<lb/>
from Habana to see us. It included Dr. Finlay.&rdquo; I had quoted you as speaking of<lb/>
the Havana Yellow Fever Board. This was a board of Cuban physicians familiar<lb/>
with yellow fever. Reed had it set up so that his cases of experimental yellow<lb/>
fever would be recognized as such by disinterested Cuban experts. Drs. Finlay<lb/>
and Albertini were among those in this <hi>Havana</hi> Yellow Fever Board, a name used<lb/>
to distinguish between that Yellow Fever Board and the U. S. Army Yellow Fever<lb/>
Board. Should I therefore re-insert the term <hi>Havana</hi> Yellow Fever Board in your<lb/>
story?</p>
<p>My &ldquo;addenda&rdquo; to your story (about which you said, &ldquo;Why bring this in?&rdquo;)<lb/>
was added for my own information as a memorandum that you could not help me re-<lb/>
garding some disputed points.</p>
<p>The colored reproductions of the painting of Walter Reed et al are being<lb/>
finished. They are really fine. I'm sorry the late series of Carroll's cases<lb/>
couldn't be included also. The painter said he &ldquo;wouldn't paint a mob scene.&rdquo; As<lb/>
it is he was persuaded to increase the group from five to fifteen figures. I'll<lb/>
see that you get a copy when they are out.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
