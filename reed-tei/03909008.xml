<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you very much indeed for your interesting letter<lb/>
of February 27th in response to my recent inquiry.</p>
<p>From what you say of the subsequent career of the Major<lb/>
Michie in question, he must have been Robert E. Lee Michie, who was<lb/>
born in Albemarle County, a contemporary and distant cousin (about<lb/>
fourth) of my father. He is the only Michie that I know of who ever<lb/>
rose to the rank of a General in the Army. I thought of him when I<lb/>
first received Atch's letter, but thought it likely that the person<lb/>
in question was someone else as I did not think that Lee Michie had<lb/>
risen to the rank of Major at a date as early as that in question.<lb/>
He was only a Colonel when the First World War broke out in 1917,<lb/>
though he became a General soon after.</p>
<p>I used to know General Michie myself, as well as his<lb/>
daughter Margaret, and I have been in recent correspondence with her.<lb/>
She has written me that she has a number of newspaper clippings<lb/>
which might interest me in connection with my family researches and<lb/>
I have intended to call on her some time when I am in New York and<lb/>
still intend to do so. Doubtless she will have some information on<lb/>
her father's slight connection with the yellow fever matter. Therefore,<lb/>
I hardly think it worth while to ask General Kean to go to any trouble<lb/>
in connection with the matter or to write to the War Department for<lb/>
General Michie's record.</p>
<p>I am, however, sending a copy of this letter to<lb/>
General Kean and if by any chance the Major Michie in question should<lb/>
be someone other than Robert E. Lee Michie, I would appreciate very<lb/>
much having that information and any further lead that would help me<lb/>
to trace his connection in the family.</p>
<p>Thanking you for your prompt reply to my inquiry and<lb/>
with kindest personal regards, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Thomas Michie</signed>
