Mr. J. A. LePrince,<lb/>
Chief Sanitary Inspector,<lb/>
Ancon.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have completed a series of tests of Phinotas Oil to<lb/>
determine as far as possible the character and quality of the stock<lb/>
now hand and to compare it with the samples of the oil recently sub-<lb/>
mitted to you by the Manufacturers.</p>
<p>The samples tested were as follows, (all from different<lb/>
barrels and opened):<lb/>

<pb n="2" id="fKAGB0020"/>
<p>- 2 -</p>
<p>The variation as to character and action was found to be<lb/>
considerable but the samples fall into three classes, as follows:<lb/>
<table rows="3" cols="2">
<row><cell>FIRST.</cell><cell>That in which a complete emulsion is immediately produced,<lb/>
the body of the water completely filled with milky clouds and<lb/>
little or no precipitate thrown down with no film formed on sur-<lb/>
face.</cell></row>
<row><cell>SECOND.</cell><cell>That in which there is partial emulsification, a more or<lb/>
less heavy white precipitate which remains on the bottom if not<lb/>
disturged, with unbroken globules of oil. There is usually on oily film<lb/>
with milky streaks or clouds and small globules of oil. Sometimes<lb/>
also a slight cloudiness often barely perceivable.</cell></row>
<row><cell>THIRD.</cell><cell>That in which there is no emulsification or cloudiness and<lb/>
no precipitate but a heavy oily film interspersed with more or<lb/>
less heavy, well-defined globules.</cell></row>
</table>
</p>
<p>In the action of the various samples there was more or less<lb/>
variation from these types but in the main the classes were well-defined.</p>
<p>The tests were made with tap water, in glass containers hold-<lb/>
ing 1000 C. C. measured with great accuracy and the oil measured by means of<lb/>
a pipette giving exact fractions of a C. C. These measurements were also<lb/>
frequently checked and verified.</p>
<p>The tests show occasional irregularities in the comparison of<lb/>
different samples at the various strengths and conditions but frequent check<lb/>
tests bore out the following conclusions: That Class I, that in which emul-<lb/>
sification is complete and a milky could, more or less dense according to<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fKAGB0030"/>
- 3 -<lb/>
strength of the solution, permeates the entire body of the water, shows<lb/>
a decided superiority over the other two classes. This is marked ex-<lb/>
cept in the tests where dilution was high 1&sol;20,000 and 1&sol;40,000, where<lb/>
the action of all becomes uncertain and the varying resistance of indi-<lb/>
vidual larvae comes into play.</p>
<p>Where a solution of 1 part Phinotas to 20 parts of water<lb/>
was made and then introduced into container with larvae and enough water<lb/>
to bring strength to the desired point, the action was more rapid than<lb/>
when the same quantity was introduced directly into the whole body of the<lb/>
water. This is doubtless due to the more rapid diffusion through the<lb/>
bodn of the water. In these tests also Class I showed its superiority<lb/>
at the different strengths used.</p>
<p>To test duration of efficiency a solution was made of<lb/>
one (1) part Phinotas to eight thousand (8,000) of water and exposed<lb/>
indoors for sixty-four (64) hours before larvae were introduced. A mark-<lb/>
ed deterioration was noted, the larvae living many hours longer than<lb/>
where even a weaker solution is made and tested at once.</p>
<p>At one (1) to five thousand (5,000) and exposed forty-<lb/>
eight (48) hours the deterioration was at least as marked.</p>
<p>In these tests Class I showed as a whole superiority to<lb/>
the other classes.</p>
<p>A small quantity of each of several samples was exposed in<lb/>
shallow dishes for forty-eight (48) hours indoors and then tested with<lb/>
the result that all classes suffered by the exposure but in varying de-<lb/>
gree, as might have been expected those which had been most exposed be-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="fKAGB0040"/>
- 4 -<lb/>
fore sample was taken showed least deterioration.</p>
<p>Sample &ldquo;A&rdquo;, Class I, in particular showed the greatest<lb/>
change and three others by this test belonged in another class.</p>
<p>To summarize: Those samples falling in Class I showed<lb/>
the greatest efficiency as well as equally long duration. Classes II<lb/>
and III show an irregularity of action which is borne out by field tests<lb/>
of Phinotas known to show same characteristics.</p>
<p>Sample &ldquo;B&rdquo;, Class III, which is recommended by the manu-<lb/>
facturer, is shown to be of doubtful efficiency and their statement (made<lb/>
in letter of June 16th, 1908, that &ldquo;The Phinotas Oil we sent you being<lb/>
only partially soluble&rdquo;) if it applies to their first shipment is clearly<lb/>
incorrect and this fact can be substantiated. I have tested in laboratory<lb/>
and witnessed field tests of their earlier shipment or shipments that were<lb/>
taken at random and was perfectly soluble and very efficient. With later<lb/>
shipments this has not been the case and the action so irregular as to<lb/>
cause great undertainty in its use in the field.</p>
<p>I have ascertained that the sample of Phinotas, labelled<lb/>
Ancon II, was taken from a barrel constituting a portion of the above ship-<lb/>
ment and this bears out the statement.</p>
<p>A drawback to the indiscriminate use of Phinotas Oil is<lb/>
the absence of any effect upon pupae at ordinary and economical strengths.<lb/>
I believe this to be due to the fact that in the pupa stage the immature<lb/>
mosquito does not eat and no passage of a poisonous substance into the<lb/>
body through the moutn is possible. Unless a heavy oily film rests upon<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="fKAGB0050"/>
- 5 -<lb/>
the surface to clog the breathing orifices, the pupa is unaffected or<lb/>
unless the caustic action of the substance used is great enough to pene-<lb/>
trate the integument. This is not the case with Phinotas unless used<lb/>
at a prohibitive strength.</p>
<p>I consider the preparation especially useful used in<lb/>
full strength in running water, even along the edges of good sized streams<lb/>
where quick action is desired and can be obtained from Class I. In such<lb/>
situations crude oil is not available as it is floated off and dissipated<lb/>
before it has lived to act. In places also where constant overflowing of<lb/>
the body of water due to rains renders constant care necessary, Phinotas<lb/>
is at least as useful and may have frequently some advantages over the<lb/>
crude oil.</p>
<p>As its permanence seems to be very difficult, field tests<lb/>
having shown breeding to begin within two days after application, it is in<lb/>
this inferior to crude oil, besides which its poisonous effect upon fish<lb/>
is a drawback to its use in many instances.</p>
<p>A point in its favor is the small bulk and consequent economy<lb/>
in handling when used in full strength. I would especially recommend that<lb/>
<hi>all</hi> Phinotas Oil used at all stations be drawn from the barrel by means of<lb/>
a stopcock as all deterioration from exposure will thus be avoided.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>(Sgd) ALLAN H. JENNINGS.</p>
