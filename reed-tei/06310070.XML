<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>It has been a month since your last<lb/>
letter and I have had it in mind for a<lb/>
week or more to write to you - not that I have<lb/>
had anything very important to tell you but just<lb/>
to keep in touch with your wonderful work and<lb/>
not to miss anything. But I appreciate how<lb/>
busy you are with all the things you put your hand<lb/>
to and that you should not waste any time on<lb/>
unproductive correspondence. You inclosed the<lb/>
printed letter to members of the Amer. Rheumatism<lb/>
Assn which served as an introduction to the<lb/>
very valuable and informing article on diagnosis<lb/>
and treatment of rheumatic diseases which is the<lb/>
first paper in the Jan (number 60) issue of the<lb/>
Army Medical Bulletin. When I read it I wished<lb/>
that I could have done so fifty years ago.<lb/>
I was pleased to Dr. Osgood's name with yours signed<lb/>
to it. I have a great regard for him both for his admi-<lb/>
rable work in the rescue and treatment of battle fractures<lb/>
in the A.E.F. in France and for his skilful care and<lb/>
advice in the treatment of my only son Robert<lb/>
who was for some years an invalid from osteomyelitis<lb/>
of the hip and ankle joints of the right leg. The hip<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06310071"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
2<lb/>
joint was distroyed and ankylosed &amp; he has still a<lb/>
discharging sinus there after 29 years. But he has been<lb/>
able to get his Ph.D. in chemistry and lead an active<lb/>
useful life. I wonder when you will get time to study<lb/>
the 40 photographs and that bibliofilm of 500 frames<lb/>
which you received from the National Archives.</p>
<p>I recall having given one or two informal talks to the<lb/>
Army Med. School on Sanitation in Cuba at the<lb/>
request of the President of the School but nothing of impor-<lb/>
tance. I have recently read most of Miss Laura<lb/>
Wood's life of Walter Reed and am much pleased<lb/>
with it. She has taken great pains to be accurate<lb/>
and has made remarkably good use of the rather<lb/>
scanty data about his boyhood experiences to make<lb/>
it connect up into a biography. I put question marks<lb/>
on the margin of her MSS where I doubted the accuracy<lb/>
of her statements or was curious as to the source<lb/>
of her information and I was much impressed<lb/>
to see how widely she had ranged in her search<lb/>
for facts and for the verification of her conclusions.<lb/>
Her objective is much more modest and restricted<lb/>
than your basic and conclusive researches; it is<lb/>
to write a popular small biography for young people.<lb/>
She has not written up the story of 1900-1901 yet.</p>
<p>We had <add>a</add> call about 2 weeks ago from Gen. &amp; Mrs. W.L.<lb/>
Reed and Mrs Blossom Reed and they told us that<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06310072"/>
J. R. K. to P.S.H.<lb/>
3<lb/>
within a week after your visit to their mother Mrs<lb/>
Walter Reed, her mind began to fail so that now she<lb/>
remembers only a few friends and hardly anything<lb/>
of the usual incidents of life. They did not encou-<lb/>
rage me to come to see her, as she would not recall<lb/>
me and it would give her no pleasure, which<lb/>
it would be painful to me. They planned to<lb/>
take her up to Blue Ridge Summit to her Sum-<lb/>
mer home this week. Blossom said she was so<lb/>
thankful that you saw her before this rapid<lb/>
deterioration began. She is 86 but it seems to<lb/>
me that the progress of this senile dementia<lb/>
has been unusually rapid, especially as she was<lb/>
so well preserved in her physical and mental<lb/>
faculties until quite recently.</p>
<p>I am glad to know that Truby sketch is in the<lb/>
hands of Dr. F. F. Russell. You know we Army<lb/>
Medical Men think there is no higher authority<lb/>
in Preventive Medicine than F. F. Russell.<lb/>
If the Surgeon General publishes Truby's sketch<lb/>
as a Bulletin and sends a copy to each offi-<lb/>
cer in the M. C. and the Med. Reserve I believe<lb/>
it will give a much wider circulation, with this<lb/>
great war on, than any plan of private<lb/>
publication for sale, I suppose that this free<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06310073"/>
4<lb/>
distribution would reach 25,000 medical men<lb/>
and there should be an additional printing for<lb/>
sale, at or near cost to libraries &amp; individuals<lb/>
which would make a much wider distribution than<lb/>
in a war-time publication for sale. It is amazing<lb/>
to what an extent war directs the attention of every<lb/>
one including professional men away from their<lb/>
usual channels of thought and mental activity.<lb/>
Your publication which will be more important<lb/>
than all these others put together should certainly<lb/>
wait for the calm days of peace and I am glad<lb/>
that you feel that way about it.</p>
<p>I am putting in a few old clippings <add><xref id="N6310074">enclosure 1</xref> <xref id="N6310075">enclosure 2</xref> <xref id="N6310076">enclosure 3</xref></add> which may<lb/>
interest you. Do not return them. I wrote the<lb/>
one &ldquo; A Candidate for Honors&rdquo;. It pleased Reed<lb/>
but did not put a bee in his bonnet. General<lb/>
O'Reilly was the man who got the appointment<lb/>
and he took me into his office to be his executive<lb/>
officer, altho. I think he was quite aware of my<lb/>
Advocacy of Walter Reed. I have been look-<lb/>
ing over a bunch of letters from Gorgas about his<lb/>
troubles on the Canal Zone but I do not think they<lb/>
contain anything of interest to you in your field<lb/>
of study. I am feeling much better now and will<lb/>
be glad to send you anything which may help you<lb/>
that I can find.</p>
