<p>A Happy New Year to<lb/>
you dearest Gran and<lb/>
to all the House of Young.<lb/>
It has opened very well<lb/>
for all of us, with bright-<lb/>
warm weather and all<lb/>
well and happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our board is little but our<lb/>
hearts are great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So are our appetites -<lb/>
We all went to Playa for<lb/>
a swim in the afternoon<lb/>
of New Years Day, and<lb/>
in the evening went to<lb/>
see the <unclear>Foye-Homebarracks</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14338002"/>
wedding at Gen. Lee's old<lb/>
<unclear>Hdqtrs</unclear>. There was an <unclear>enor-</unclear><lb/>
mous crush and all the<lb/>
military hierarchy turned<lb/>
out to see the fun, but it<lb/>
is said not much of the<lb/>
<unclear>jeute fina</unclear> of Havana.<lb/>
The bride is handsome<lb/>
and fat and will look<lb/>
fair fat &amp; forty in three<lb/>
years from now altho she<lb/>
is only twenty two --</p>
<p>You could have cut the<lb/>
garlic with a knife, Helen<lb/>
would have enjoyed it im-<lb/>
mensely- There has been<lb/>
much giving on lately in<lb/>
the way of dances, card<lb/>
parties, <unclear>etc.</unclear> I have not<lb/>
been able to do any studying<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14338003"/>
at all altho, the order for my examination<lb/>
may come any day. So with the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> I<lb/>
<unclear>I wore</unclear> off from all drinks, card parties<lb/>
&amp; pleasures of all sorts that would interfere<lb/>
with work, and will ride on the water-<lb/>
wagon until I stand my exam-<lb/>
It seems pretty certain now that the Army<lb/>
bill will pass, and that promotes me<lb/>
&amp; half a dozen below me. So you will<lb/>
plainly see that it behooves me to buckle<lb/>
down and learn the morphological and<lb/>
cultural peculiarities of the one hundred<lb/>
and forty seven species of pathological<lb/>
bacteria. I suppose you keep posted<lb/>
on the mosquito question. I no longer call<lb/>
it a theory as it has passed into the<lb/>
domain of well established facts- All five<lb/>
of the mosquito-bitten men came <unclear>down &amp;</unclear><lb/>
not a man from the infected clothing<lb/>
house, altho- for a month we have had<lb/>
non-immunes sleeping in the beds and<lb/>
wearing the pajamas of yellow fever<lb/>
patients, &amp; have tried in every way <hi>except</hi><lb/>
the mosquito, to infect them. It is a great discovery.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14338004"/>
HEADQUARTERS<lb/>
DEPARTMENT OF CUBA<lb/>
Office of the Chief Surgeon<lb/>
HAVANA<lb/>
Gen Wood has on my recom-<lb/>
mendation published a<lb/>
mosquito order for the<lb/>
troops, &amp; Gorgas will make<lb/>
waging war against them<lb/>
a prominent feature of<lb/>
his sanitary work here-<lb/>
after.</p>
<p>Well you are probably<lb/>
more interested in that<lb/>
Beautiful Bobby than<lb/>
in Culex faciatus, So I<lb/>
must say a word about<lb/>
him. He is getting to be<lb/>
a fine big baby and is<lb/>
as good as gold and<lb/>
a general favorite.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14338005"/>
He is said by people who<lb/>
have every reason to be<lb/>
unprejudiced impartial<lb/>
and truthful to be a<lb/>
very handsome - baby.<lb/>
As I jump him I stand<lb/>
high in his good graces &amp;<lb/>
he grins and puts out<lb/>
his arms to me <unclear>whenever</unclear><lb/>
I come around.</p>
<p>Martha is much more<lb/>
serene and well behaved<lb/>
I think than she was<lb/>
at Morristown. She has<lb/>
now settled down to the<lb/>
role of a little bare head-<lb/>
ed tom-boy &amp; talks of nothing<lb/>
but looses &amp; mules, &amp; the<lb/>
points of her horse Feather.</p>
<pb n="6" id="f14338006"/>
<p>Louise is very well and very pretty.<lb/>
She had a dressmaker in Morristown who<lb/>
has sent her a bill, but as said bill<lb/>
(enclosed) does not state the <unclear>lady's</unclear><lb/>
initials or address I am at a loss how<lb/>
to pay her unless you will be good enough<lb/>
to do so. As L. says that the dresses<lb/>
didn't fit she dont seem to care whether<lb/>
the said Mrs Fox is paid or not-<lb/>
L. tells me too that she owes you $17<hi rend="superscript">00</hi><lb/>
so I enclose a N. Y. draft for $45<hi rend="superscript">00</hi><lb/>
If you will pay <unclear>Mrs Fox</unclear> &amp; square your<lb/>
<unclear>ape</unclear> with the balance I will be very<lb/>
grateful to you.</p>
<p>Goodbye dear Gran I must get<lb/>
back to the bacteria. With kisses<lb/>
for the girls I remain with much love</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your son</salute>
<signed>Randolph</signed>
I sent Mr. Y. a few Partegas- did<lb/>
they arrive safety?<lb/>
