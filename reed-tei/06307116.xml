<salute>My dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of the 22nd ult. at hand, and I have read and re-read your<lb/>
letter as well as the very excellent article you have had printed in Hygeia.<lb/>
The yellow fever matter has come up more forceably lately and I have corres-<lb/>
ponded quite a little with Truby. As you know he is writing a personal history<lb/>
of it. I have also had several communications from Kean.</p>
<p>I was in San Francisco in early November and called on Truby whom I had<lb/>
not seen since 1906 in Omaha, and while his work is good I found that he had<lb/>
slipped very markedly since my associations with him years ago. Of course, I<lb/>
understand a man cannot retain his full faculties to the end of life, however,<lb/>
I hope Truby will complete his article shortly.</p>
<p>Your interest in this matter is very commendable and you have certainly<lb/>
gone to a great deal of work in research and visitation with the different ones<lb/>
who were connected in any way with the experiment. You say that you will per-<lb/>
haps go through Omaha later on this winter, so if you do, I certainly insist<lb/>
that you come to see me and we can talk over this matter from beginning to end.<lb/>
Any time will suit me so make your plans accordingly.</p>
<p>I was so disgusted with some of the last statements in Truby's notes as<lb/>
some things John Kissinger said about Dean being bitten by the mosquitoe. In<lb/>
the first place, Kissinger never knew Dean, nor never talked to him until after<lb/>
I left there in the fall of 1900. I cannot understand after a lapse of so many<lb/>
years why a man can try to make capital out of whole cloth which has been done<lb/>
a good many times in this experiment. I assure you of my interest and willing-<lb/>
ness to give you a clear picture of what I saw. The picture Yellow Jack has<lb/>
too many discrepancies.</p>
<p>Feel free to bring along any questions or if you prefer send them to me<lb/>
by mail and I will be glad to answer them with any information that I may have.</p>
<p>Thanking you for your interest in this matter and assuring you of my heart-<lb/>
felt cooperation, I remain,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
