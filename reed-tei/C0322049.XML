<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>1: Your good letter of September 22nd. was awaiting me<lb/>
here last Tuesday, on my return from Baltimore, where I am profoundly<lb/>
thankful to state, I took the metal file-cases, contain<del>g</del>ing the com-<lb/>
p<del>o</del><add>l</add>eted references for the History of Yellow Fever last Monday and turned<lb/>
them over to Dr. Frost, who has begun the final editing of the MSS of<lb/>
Father's Historyof Yellow Fever. This, of course, is a tremendous step<lb/>
forward, really the <unclear>beginning</unclear> of the end, although, as I wrote you in<lb/>
my tentative estimate of the time needed to finish the book, how long<lb/>
it will take Dr. Frost to do this work depends on how much uninterrupted<lb/>
time he can give it.</p>
<p>2: While Dr. Frost is doing this final edition, Miss Brown<lb/>
and I have been, and will be, strenuously occupied in trying to verify<lb/>
the comparatively few references we have not yet been able to complete.<lb/>
We have already done a lot of work on all of them, but there <add>are</add> some<lb/>
untried methods of approach, which naturally entail a lot of reading<lb/>
and hard work.</p>
<p>3: In connection with the verification of references, I<lb/>
am very grateful to Mr. Van Wesep for his help and kindness and am<lb/>
writing to him personally on the subject. His letter, and enclosures,<lb/>
came just before I left for Baltimore, hence in time for me to take<lb/>
his verified references over to Dr. Frost.</p>
<p>3': A letter just received from Dr. Connor, from Brazil,<lb/>
is also going to be a big help in clearing up his bibliography, as, just<lb/>
as I had suspected, some of his statements quoted by Father, were per-<lb/>
sonal communications and we would have lost much time looking for them<lb/>
in print.</p>
<pb n="2" id="fC0322050"/>
<p>-2-<lb/>
print.</p>
<p>4: I wish also to gratefully acknowledge a letter, received<lb/>
this morning, from Mr. <unclear>Gilette<del>r</del></unclear>, stating that it had been decided to<lb/>
continue Miss Brown's salary through the month of October. I am deeply<lb/>
gratified at this decision and I am sure that Miss Brown will also<lb/>
much appreciate the recognition of her services implied in keeping her<lb/>
on the October payroll, <del>when</del> after she had offered to work after<lb/>
September 30th. without compensation. I feel the more glad of this<lb/>
decision, because Miss Brown has always positively refused to let me<lb/>
reimburse her for any unusual expenses incurred by herself in connec-<lb/>
tion with our work: taxis for transportation of heavy files and valuable<lb/>
books in rainy weather: trips to my apartment for night work etc. etc.,<lb/>
although,save when it was a physical impossibility, I always attended to<lb/>
the former myself.</p>
<p>Well, I've heard much speculation among my friends as to<lb/>
whether I would finish the book or the book would finish me, but I<lb/>
always <unclear>intended</unclear> to &ldquo;hang on&rdquo; until the end and, although I'll admit<lb/>
there's not much left of me, there's even less left of the book--thank<lb/>
God! Also, It will be worth all that it has cost, which is high<lb/>
praise--even for it.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
