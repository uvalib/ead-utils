<p>By Frank Carey<lb/>
Associated Press Science Reporter</p>
<p>Washington, --(AP)--Wanted: $50,000 to $100,000<lb/>
to preserve a &ldquo;rotting&rdquo; little building in Cuba which saw one of<lb/>
the most dramatic adventures in history a half century ago.</p>
<p>It is one of the two structures in which Major Walter<lb/>
Reed and his associates conducted final experiments in 1900<lb/>
leading to the conquest of yellow fever.</p>
<p>The researches of Reed and his colleagues--with the<lb/>
aid of heroic volunteers--demonstrated that yellow fever is<lb/>
transmitted by a mosquito and is not contagious as had previously<lb/>
been believed. This led to effective measures for the control<lb/>
of the great plague.</p>
<p>Still standing today, near the town of Quemados, not<lb/>
far from Havana, is a small wooden building in which volunteers<lb/>
underwent a gruesome experience which exploded the theory that<lb/>
yellow fever could be contracted from &ldquo;fomites&rdquo;--the soiled<lb/>
and bloody bedding and clothing of fever victims.</p>
<p>The second building, in which some men were exposed<lb/>
to the bites of infected mosquitoes, has long since disappeared--<lb/>
believed to have been destroyed by a hurricane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Building No. 1&rdquo;--the &ldquo;infected bedding building&rdquo; where<lb/>
heroic volunteers slept for 21 nights without contracting fever--<lb/>
was &ldquo;rediscovered&rdquo; in 1940 by Dr. Philip S. Hench of the Mayo<lb/>
Clinic and two companions. One of the latter was &ldquo;Johnny&rdquo; Moran,<lb/>
one of the original volunteers who got yellow fever from exposure<lb/>
to infected mosquitoes.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f04334002"/>
<p>Dr. Hench, who himself has contributed much to<lb/>
humanity by his researches on cortisone and ACTH, the drugs<lb/>
which have shown dramatic promise against arthritis and<lb/>
certain other diseases, has made an avocation of the Walter Reed<lb/>
Epic.</p>
<p>For a decade now, he has sought vainly to have some-<lb/>
thing done about preserving the ancient building--all that<lb/>
remains of the &ldquo;battlefield&rdquo; of the great experiment.</p>
<p>The Cuban government, he says, has designated this<lb/>
&ldquo;old warrior&rdquo; as a national monument, but so far has not done<lb/>
anything about its actual preservation.</p>
<p>It stands &ldquo;creaking with age and sleeping in the Cuban<lb/>
Sun,&rdquo; Hench reports. &ldquo;At its back is an encroaching quarry;<lb/>
in front, a field of corn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But &ldquo;it is falling to pieces and being allowed to rot,&rdquo;<lb/>
Hench said, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's a darn shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hench says he volunteered to stand the cost of<lb/>
temporarily fortifying the structure with galvanized iron until<lb/>
more lasting preservation could be made. But he said this<lb/>
offer was politely declined because the Cubans wished to do this<lb/>
work themselves. He said the Cuban government at one time<lb/>
allocated $50,000 for protecting the building and laying out<lb/>
the grounds, but all this was some time ago--and nothing has<lb/>
happened since.</p>
<p>Hench has vainly tried to interest certain American<lb/>
Philanthropists. He also has sought aid from the army, in<lb/>
whose name Reed did his monumental research. So far, no funds<lb/>
have been forthcoming.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f04334003"/>
<p>&ldquo;That is where the matter stands and it is a darn<lb/>
shame,&rdquo; Hench told a reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <unclear>haven't</unclear> had the time to go out and collect nickels<lb/>
and I haven't found a millionaire with $50,000 or $100,000.<lb/>
Yet here a little building which saw one of the most dramatic<lb/>
adventures in history is being allowed to rot.&rdquo;</p>
