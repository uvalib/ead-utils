JERSEY CITY, N.J.<lb/>
<date value="1942-03-27">March 27, 1942.</date>

<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>First, let me say that I have purchased the Dorothea Lynde<lb/>
Dix Memorial, the first of many prepared by her for various<lb/>
state legislatures and the United States Congress itself. A<lb/>
small amount of this memorial is quoted in my &ldquo;Life&rdquo; of Miss<lb/>
Dix but now, since looking over the complete Memorial I<lb/>
believe that it will supply me with a very accurate descrip-<lb/>
tion of what Cornwell should paint. Incidentally, down at<lb/>
Wyeth's they feel that in addition to having the &ldquo;Pioneer&rdquo;<lb/>
series include one nurse they should also include one pharm-<lb/>
acist. It is just as difficult to find a single outstanding<lb/>
pharmacist as it has been to find an outstanding nurse.<lb/>
Contributions by Pharmacy to Medicine have been very great<lb/>
but as far as I can find out, Dr. Procter, who has been<lb/>
immortalized with a bust in the Hall of Pharmacy in Washington<lb/>
as father of American Pharmacy is entirely unknown by the<lb/>
practicing pharmacist. They know only one great name in<lb/>
Pharmacy and that is Remington, whose outstanding contribution<lb/>
seems to have been the text book which all the boys studied<lb/>
in school.</p>
<p>In the field of nursing, as I may have told you, every editor<lb/>
of the nursing journals has some pet nurse in the history of<lb/>
the profession always not heard of by the other groups. Clara<lb/>
Barton's name, known by every school boy, is anathema because<lb/>
she opposed the training of nurses. Inasmuch as the nurses<lb/>
themselves know very little about Dorothea Lynde Dix who was<lb/>
neither for nor against the training of nurses, but who did<lb/>
act as the head of the Army Nursing Service for some time dur-<lb/>
ing the Civil War, she seems to be a pretty safe choice, but<lb/>
her real contribution was in the field of sociology.</p>
<p>There were four or five physicians who had done splendid work<lb/>
in the United States, all in their chosen field, that of the<lb/>
insane and feeble-minded. Their influence, however, was re-<lb/>
stricted to the individual institutions in which they worked.<lb/>
Miss Dix became a friend and deciple of all of these men dur-<lb/>
ing the first 2 or 3 years in which she applied herself to<lb/>
this subject. Following this tutelage under physicians her<lb/>
influence then next became nationwide extending even to Europe.<lb/>
It is she who has been credited with ar<del>r</del>ousing the interest of<lb/>
not only the layman but most of the medical profession in the<lb/>
study and care of the insane and feeble-minded.</p>

<p>Dr. Philip S. Hench</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>March 27, 1942</p>
<p>I can think of no nurse either here or in Europe that even<lb/>
approached her in influence and accomplishment in her chosen<lb/>
field other than of course the mightily publicized Florence<lb/>
Nightingale. As I understand it, Florence Nightingale never<lb/>
stood in her own light. On the contrary, Miss Dix might have<lb/>
been much better known had she not been so insistent that not<lb/>
only no biography be written of herself during her lifetime<lb/>
but that with the exception of one named for her father no one<lb/>
of the many institutions which she founded should be named for<lb/>
her.</p>
<p>I am writing you this partly because I think you might be in-<lb/>
terested and partly because in my own mind I am trying to re-<lb/>
evaluate her status as the proper representative of nursing in<lb/>
the &ldquo;Pioneer&rdquo; series.</p>
<p>Dr. Sigerist, who probably knows very little about the history<lb/>
of nursing and yet who probably knows much more than the average<lb/>
physician, agreed with me that she was quite acceptable for the<lb/>
place. Before we actually start to work I may consult him again.<lb/>
I am sorry that the only biography was written by a very pious<lb/>
person who never let his heroine step out of the role of a god-<lb/>
anointed virgin. She must have had some faults or weaknesses but<lb/>
not according to her biographer.</p>

<p>In reply to your letter of the 20th, the only way I can see that<lb/>
the calcium subject can be properly discussed is in person. I<lb/>
am leaving for Chicago on Monday night, the 30th, and will get<lb/>
in touch with you by 'phone from there on the 2nd. Perhaps you<lb/>
will be able to give me a little time in Rochester at the end<lb/>
of that week. Until that time please keep the material that I<lb/>
sent.</p>
