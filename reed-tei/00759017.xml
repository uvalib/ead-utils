<salute>Dear Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I found Laura's (Jr) letter when I got in<lb/>
last evening &amp; I wrote at once to Henry so that I might<lb/>
make no delay in his getting his letter- Unfortunately<lb/>
the letter has had no chance to go to PeeDee yet-there<lb/>
being no mail on Sunday. I think Mr Stewart will<lb/>
go to P. D. this afternoon however, certainly early in the<lb/>
morning, so it will catch the early train tomorrow<lb/>
morning As will this</p>
<p>We had a full day yesterday &amp; a pretty fair day<lb/>
Unless something happens we will finish here <hi>Tuesday</hi><lb/>
I <hi>presume</hi> that I will spend Wednesday in Raleigh, &amp; reach<lb/>
home Thursday <hi>morning</hi>- i.e. Oct 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. I may not howev-<lb/>
er be able to do this until Oct 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> in the evening<lb/>
- late evening. Also it depends on having two<lb/>
days - Monday &amp; Tuesday - <hi>clear</hi>. Today is <hi>beauti-<lb/>
ful</hi>. If only Friday had been so,-we would<lb/>
have saved<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00759018"/>
one day. It might have rained last night &amp; to-<lb/>
day. Indeed we have lost two full days by rain<lb/>
since I have been here - 2 3/4 indeed.</p>
<p>I think the trip has been good for me I am <unclear>strong &amp; en-</unclear>-<lb/>
during again &amp; won't have to sleep a week to catch up<lb/>
as I did the last time I came home. Indeed the<lb/>
work has not been especially hard this time. It<lb/>
has been cool enough: I was better equipped-espe-<lb/>
cially in shoes: &amp; we knew how to save ourselves,<lb/>
&amp; what to do from our previous experience here<lb/>
I will however be glad to be back <hi>very</hi> glad. <del>I hope<lb/>
too that</del> I want to see you every day &amp; while you<lb/>
have written twice &amp; Laura every day yet that is<lb/>
not like seeing you. She Laura says that your<lb/>
rheumatism is better - for which God be thanked.</p>
<p>I presume that Mary will be back before I will. <del><unclear>I</unclear></del><lb/>
When you write tell me what she says of Nan-<lb/>
nie &amp; her tonsils.</p>
<p>I am afraid that it is a little too cool in Baltimore<lb/>
It has been absolutely clear here - a few thin clouds<lb/>
in the S. E. now- Absolutely still but the temperature<lb/>
at noon was <hi>67</hi>&deg;- &amp; we are 180 to 200 miles south of Balt.</p>
<p>Laura tells me that the last Iris have come &amp; been set out<lb/>
Just before a rain, I think we will have a fine dis-<lb/>
play next<lb/>
spring. If we can have<lb/>
a late fall like last year<lb/>
I am sure than we will</p>
