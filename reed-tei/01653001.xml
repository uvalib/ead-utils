<salute>My darling, little Sweetheart;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here<lb/>
it is Monday morning, the<lb/>
beginning of a new week, and<lb/>
just the time, above all others,<lb/>
when I should feel refresh<lb/>
-ed in mind &amp; body. But, I<lb/>
assure you, unless my sen-<lb/>
sations sadly deceive me,<lb/>
that I am an exhausted<lb/>
boy, scarcely able to keep<lb/>
my <add>eyes</add> open. Whether I shall<lb/>
be able to finish this let-<lb/>
ter, remains to be seen.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01653002"/>
One thing is very sure, and<lb/>
that is, if there is anything<lb/>
that <hi>can</hi> keep my mental<lb/>
machinery in motion, it<lb/>
is <hi>thinking of you</hi>, and if<lb/>
there is any task that this<lb/>
right hand delights to<lb/>
perform, it is <hi>writing<lb/>
to you</hi>. It may surprise<lb/>
you to be told that I have<lb/>
had some very hard work<lb/>
to do, during the past week:<lb/>
Strange as it may <add>seem,</add> an<lb/>
army surgeon occa<del>s</del>sion-<lb/>
ally has something to do;<lb/>
and, in this instance, it<lb/>
has all fallen on my<lb/>
shoulders. Dr Byrne<del>'s</del> is<lb/>
absent, on a week's leave-<lb/>
Dr Heger has not yet put<lb/>
in an appearance, &amp; in<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01653003"/>
fact is so very slow, in<lb/>
obeying orders, that I have<lb/>
almost abandoned all<lb/>
hope of his <hi>ever</hi> coming-<lb/>
As a consequence, I have<lb/>
been left alone, to make<lb/>
out reports, (something<lb/>
less than a thousand to be<lb/>
made out,) to attend to the<lb/>
sick, etc. As it happens,<lb/>
there are just one dozen<lb/>
soldiers sick &amp; almost<lb/>
as many Children- Some<lb/>
of the latter very sick,<lb/>
&amp; requiring my constant<lb/>
attention- Add to this my<lb/>
duties as caterer of the<lb/>
mess, &amp; you can under-<lb/>
stand that I have my<lb/>
hands well occupied-<lb/>
Besides these few trivialities<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01653004"/>
I will have to change my<lb/>
quarters, this week, so as<lb/>
to give Dr Heger a res-<lb/>
ting spot- You perceive,<lb/>
at present, I am occu-<lb/>
pying the surgeon's house<lb/>
&amp; have been doing so ever<lb/>
since I have been at the<lb/>
Post- Dr B. being a bachelor,<lb/>
there was an abundance<lb/>
of room, &amp; he was glad<lb/>
to share his house with<lb/>
me, for the sake of my<lb/>
company- (I confess that the<lb/>
last statement seems in-<lb/>
credible, &amp; yet it is true.)<lb/>
But Dr Heger has very<lb/>
foolishly or wisely, I don't<lb/>
know which, seen fit to<lb/>
get married, &amp; of course<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01653005"/>
would prefer to have his<lb/>
dwelling all to himself-<lb/>
Hence, I, unfortunate mor-<lb/>
tal, must, like the Arab,<lb/>
&ldquo;strike my tent &amp; steal away&rdquo;.<lb/>
I go, however, with a cheerful<lb/>
spirit, inasmuch as my future<lb/>
quarters are very comfor-<lb/>
table. From reports that have<lb/>
reached me, I don't think<lb/>
that I shall occupy them<lb/>
very long. I have <add>been</add> told that<lb/>
the Surgeon General contem-<lb/>
plates assigning the recently<lb/>
appointed Asst. Surgeons<lb/>
to permanent duty very<lb/>
soon- My only fear is, that<lb/>
my orders will come be-<lb/>
fore I can get my leave-<lb/>
Still there is nothing def-<lb/>
inite to be ascertained on<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01653006"/>
the subject. I tell you this,<lb/>
so that you may not be<lb/>
disappointed, should I<lb/>
not be able to come. Be<lb/>
convinced, however, that I<lb/>
shall let no chance escape<lb/>
me of coming, for really, I<lb/>
feel as if I hadn't seen<lb/>
your darling face for, at<lb/>
least, one year- You can lit-<lb/>
tle know how anxious<lb/>
I am to come to Murfrees-<lb/>
boro- So much do I desire<lb/>
to see you, if only for a few<lb/>
days, that, were there no<lb/>
other means of commun-<lb/>
ication, I would gladly<lb/>
walk every mile- How fleet<lb/>
of foot I should be, know-<lb/>
ing that there was such<lb/>
an <hi>angel</hi> awaiting my<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01653007"/>
coming! Bless your darling<lb/>
heart! You are <hi>dearer</hi> to<lb/>
me every day of my life!<lb/>
The &ldquo;love,&rdquo; which you say<lb/>
&ldquo;burns in my heart for<lb/>
a moment,&rdquo; is <hi>ever</hi> burn-<lb/>
ing there, &amp; day by day, its<lb/>
blaze grows purer &amp; brighter.<lb/>
&ldquo;Ficle&rdquo;! I may be in all<lb/>
things else, but <hi>not in that</hi>-<lb/>
Oh! No! There am I <hi>stead-<lb/>
fast</hi>,- <hi>fixed</hi>, &amp; nought can<lb/>
ever move me! What should<lb/>
change me? The silly, light-<lb/>
headed girls that one meets<lb/>
wherever he goes? These<lb/>
moths hovering about the<lb/>
blaze of Fashion -- carried<lb/>
away with the frivolities<lb/>
of the day, &amp; never evolving<lb/>
one sound thought! Away<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01653008"/>
with the thought! What pleas-<lb/>
ure and happiness could<lb/>
I find in the society of<lb/>
such creatures? None what-<lb/>
ever- Ah! no! let me worship<lb/>
some sweet, modest, sen-<lb/>
sible, Christian woman, or<lb/>
none at all- One whose pres-<lb/>
ence could make home bright-<lb/>
er, &amp; could lessen, rather<lb/>
than add to, life's toils! And<lb/>
<hi>you</hi>, my darling Emilie, are<lb/>
such an one! I desire no<lb/>
brighter gem to deck my Crown<lb/>
than your own sweet self-<lb/>
You are my ideal of a woman<lb/>
and the guiding star of<lb/>
my life-!</p>
<closer>
<salute>Whilst I, am<lb/>
ever, your <hi>fond</hi> and<lb/>
<hi>devoted</hi></salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.

P.S. How does it happen that you<lb/>
failed to write on Friday? No let-<lb/>
ter has arrived, to-day, &amp; hence<lb/>
my disappointment is very<lb/>
great- I did not think that<lb/>
you last letter was to take<lb/>
the place of your regular weekly<lb/>
letter, but <del>was</del> <add>rather</add> an additional<lb/>
favor which you had bestowed-<lb/>
I am afraid that I was mistaken.<lb/>
Tomorrow will decide- W.R.
