<salute>My Dear - Both of You:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Well I found my letters at<lb/>
the office this A.M. &amp; a vessel leaves for<lb/>
N.O. tomorrow noon - so by mail-<lb/>
ing this at 6. A. M. You will get your<lb/>
answers <hi>nearly</hi> as quick, as if I had<lb/>
written them last night.</p>
<p>Yes I am glad that Laura got her<lb/>
bracelet &amp; necklace fixed, &amp; if she can<lb/>
get a proper &ldquo;book-mark&rdquo; she can have<lb/>
her long-promised seal cut.</p>
<p>Henry finds his Anatomy hard. It is<lb/>
hard, &amp; very glad am I that Chemistry<lb/>
is practically out of his way. I cannot<lb/>
but congratulate myself on giving him<lb/>
the smattering of chemistry - but a real<lb/>
<hi>knowledge</hi> of its <hi>principles</hi> - with which<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00740002"/>
he went to College. It probably saved him<lb/>
last year - for many a one failed in chemistry<lb/>
- &amp; succeeding last year is of infinite ad-<lb/>
vantage to him this year.</p>
<p>He says that he is having a pleasanter time<lb/>
than last year. Also that he is spending more<lb/>
money- He says that all told it will cost him $500,<lb/>
well. Henry is as far from extravagant as a fellow<lb/>
well can be &amp; I had rather he did not deny<lb/>
himself what he wants - he will only want what<lb/>
he ought to have.</p>
<p>I am utterly grieved about Dr <unclear>Puriance</unclear>- Officially<lb/>
I had little use for him - personally I liked him.<lb/>
He was always pleasant &amp; I think was fond of me.</p>
<p>Have heard nothing from <unclear>Probst</unclear> - but ought to by<lb/>
Sunday &amp; if I hear anything by that time w'h<lb/>
causes me to change my plan I will cable,<lb/>
so no cable means no change- If I hear any-<lb/>
thing by next Wednesday morning - making<lb/>
me change my plan of leaving that day- 12 am<lb/>
I will cable the next Saturday which you<lb/>
will get before I could be there - &ldquo;there&rdquo; means<lb/>
Baltimore-</p>
<pb n="3" id="f00740003"/>
<p>I am very sorry to hear of Clarence's ill health. He is an<lb/>
extremely pleasant fellow. There was more the mat-<lb/>
ter with Carter than Finney found out - but still he had<lb/>
nothing <hi>in the joint</hi> - that is good to know-<lb/>
H. R C</p>
<p>My present plan is to bring my <hi>empty</hi> trunk<lb/>
with me - so as to help bring things back but<lb/>
things come far cheaper by freight than <del>by</del><lb/>
as baggage- The <hi>N.Y</hi> s.s. allows 200 lbs of<lb/>
baggage on each ticket. I do not know when<lb/>
the Spanish line allows. Freight to Pana-<lb/>
way is $9 00/100 per ton $5 00/100 to Colon &amp; $4 00/100 <unclear>more</unclear> to<lb/>
Panama: &amp; probably $2 00/100 to get it up the hill<lb/>
in Carts.</p>
<p>If I <hi>am</hi> delayed would it not be well to<lb/>
await me at N. R. I. Just as you all<lb/>
choose. Lots of Malaria here, the Head Nurse<lb/>
in dorm today &amp; had to take Q. hyperdermat-<lb/>
ically - as have a number of them. Practi-<lb/>
cally all recover promptly, but get sick a-<lb/>
gain. You may not think it but it is<lb/>
to the full as hot as it was in July &amp; 200%<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00740004"/>
wetter. I fear to risk you here<lb/>
yet I judge that we will. There are<lb/>
lots of privations however &amp; few<lb/>
compensations, still I am hoping<lb/>
that this will be my last letter<lb/>
until I see you again. Must close now<lb/>
I have been hard at work all day arranging<lb/>
for my Detention House, &amp; will have everything as<lb/>
well arranged as I can get it by Tuesday night,</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the &ldquo;3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of November&rdquo; &amp; a holyday<lb/>
<del>of</del> for all &amp; a great fiesta- All of us are<lb/>
going to hear the Te Deum, at 9 A. M. at<lb/>
the Cathedral. I wish it were earlier say<lb/>
7 or 7.30 when it was not so hot. How-<lb/>
ever we are going-</p>
<p>Again good night</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your loving father<lb/>
&amp;<lb/>
husband</salute>
<signed>H. R. Carter</signed>
I will mail this tonight - it is<lb/>
about 9.45<lb/>
</closer>
