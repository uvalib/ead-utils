<p>GENERAL LEE ON FEVER.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Gives Out an Interesting Interview on<lb/>
the Quemados Situation.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Says His First Duty Is to His Soldiers, and<lb/>
the Cubans Cannot Complain if Insular<lb/>
Funds Are Spent to Protect Their Lives--<lb/>
Says Rain Brought on Disease.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>A reporter for THE POST approached<lb/>
General Lee Sunday on the subject of<lb/>
yellow fever at Quemados. No sooner<lb/>
had the subject been broached than the<lb/>
general abruptly said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you know a yellow fever baci-<lb/>
lus if you met it on the road, or else-<lb/>
where?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;Then<lb/>
listen,&rdquo; said General Lee, and he dictated<lb/>
the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quemados is one of the prettiest and<lb/>
should be one of the healthiest towns in<lb/>
Cuba. Situated on an elevated plane,<lb/>
with wide, well-drained macadamized<lb/>
streets, fringed on each side with shade<lb/>
trees, it offers no attraction to the yellow<lb/>
king bacillus and his amarillo cohorts<unclear>.</unclear><lb/>
Up to its very gates, on every side, 15,000<lb/>
men of the Seventh army corps formerly<lb/>
safely dwelled, and today Columbia bar-<lb/>
racks, with the Seventh cavalry, Eighth<lb/>
infantry and two batteries of light artil-<lb/>
lery is close to its northern limits, and<lb/>
with its fine water supply, splendid sewer<lb/>
system and high limestone hills overlook-<lb/>
ing the sea, will successfully, I think, re-<lb/>
sist all assaults of old bacillus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quemados, however, has one street<lb/>
which crosses the railroad in the direct-<lb/>
ion of the barracks and along which are<lb/>
strung many little shanties and saloons,<lb/>
rented and operated by non-immunes,<lb/>
for the purpose of catching the soldier<lb/>
trade. The unusual fall of heavy rain<lb/>
this month overflowed the sinks and<lb/>
made slush of filthy back yards upon<lb/>
which the fierce rays of a tropical sun<lb/>
fell. Germs were generated, and the Yel-<lb/>
low King, or &lsquo;Y. K.&rsquo; as the &lsquo;Christian<lb/>
Scientists&rsquo; call him, was removed or re-<lb/>
leased from the nidus, tainted the local<lb/>
atmosphere and invaded with poison-<lb/>
ous breath the lungs of the most recept-<lb/>
ve, yet unsuspecting people.</p>
<p>Down the street Bacillus pursued his<lb/>
distructive course. Major Edmunds and<lb/>
his wife, Captain Hepburn, a signal<lb/>
corps man who slept in his house, and<lb/>
others on the same street and within the<lb/>
pestilential focus fell, before his baneful<lb/>
blade.</p>
<p>Major Kean, chief surgeon of the de-<lb/>
partment, and charged with the duty of<lb/>
riding down disease, frequently marched<lb/>
into the street to meet the invader Bacil-<lb/>
lus and shoot the old warrior to death<lb/>
with medicinal skill and medical juris-<lb/>
prudence. He was welcomed with ex-<lb/>
ceeding joy by the &lsquo;Y. K.&rsquo; &lsquo;Breathe the<lb/>
air that I breathe&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Go to my<lb/>
nidus and see if you can tell where I came<lb/>
from and where I journey to.&rsquo; Today<lb/>
the chief surgeon is the prisoner of the<lb/>
&lsquo;Y. K.&rsquo; and his yellow flag now floats<lb/>
over his couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately most of the <unclear>[unclear]</unclear><lb/>
especially the women and children, left<lb/>
Quemados last month to spend the sum-<lb/>
mer in the United States. The order has<lb/>
been issued, &lsquo;To your tents, oh non-<lb/>
immunes.&rsquo; The houses and grounds oc-<lb/>
cupied by them have been, thoroughly<lb/>
disinfected, so that it is hoped, that the<lb/>
&lsquo;Y. K.&rsquo; will cease firing for want of am-<lb/>
munition and die for want of nourish-<lb/>
ment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lest we forget, lest we forget,&rsquo; the<lb/>
Cubans should remember the United<lb/>
States soldier and sailor blood freely<lb/>
shed and the money from the United<lb/>
States treasury freely given to relieve<lb/>
them from Spanish rule, and in return<lb/>
make no unfriendly comments on insular<lb/>
funds being spent to protect the lives of<lb/>
American soldiers and citizens. My first<lb/>
duty is to the soldiers of my command,<lb/>
who are here to maintain the peace of<lb/>
this island and the rights of the people<lb/>
of every country, and whose welfare and<lb/>
safety from disease must be most care-<lb/>
fully looked after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said General Lee, turning<lb/>
to the reporter, &ldquo;I do not think any less<lb/>
of you for not knowing anything of<lb/>
Bacillus. No man does. The ablest<lb/>
physician, whether a propounder of new<lb/>
opinions on other subjects or a dogmatic<lb/>
theorist, a learned doctrinaire or a reg-<lb/>
ular old-time doctor knows nothing of<lb/>
the origin of yellow fever, because its<lb/>
germs have never been discovered and<lb/>
they will tell you so. &lsquo;Absolutomente<lb/>
nada.&rsquo; Much is known of the treatment<lb/>
of the disease when once acquired, and<lb/>
much too about the necessary measures<lb/>
to be taken to prevent being sick, as well<lb/>
as to circumscribe it within its original<lb/>
focus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, we know nothing of Y. K.,<lb/>
except that when the bacillus has been<lb/>
removed from the nidus he is more ter-<lb/>
rible than any army with banners as he<lb/>
rides at the head of the germs, flying<lb/>
proudly a banner upon whose danger-<lb/>
ous folds we see a powder magazine into<lb/>
which a lighted match is being thrown,<lb/>
and the motto, &lsquo;run or rust.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>NEW ROAD TO QUEMADOS.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Havana Will Soon Have an Excellent Drive<lb/>
Along the Coast.</p>
<p>The new public road to connect Que-<lb/>
mados with Havana, and which is to run<lb/>
by Vedado, is nearly complete.</p>
<p>In a few weeks Havana will have an<lb/>
excellent drive along the Atlantic, or a<lb/>
short distance from it, all the way to<lb/>
Camp Columbia and Quemados.</p>
<p>Heretofore all traffic by vehicles be-<lb/>
tween Havana and Quemados and Ma-<lb/>
rianao was by way of Cerro and Puentes<lb/>
Grandes. By this route there were a<lb/>
number of hills to cross, and the narrow<lb/>
cut-up streets through Cerro made travel<lb/>
very unpleasant. The old road was not<lb/>
well built and was always in bad condi-<lb/>
tion, despite the fact that thousands of<lb/>
dollars had annually to be spent upon it<lb/>
for repairs, which were always in need.</p>
<p>The new road will be one of the best<lb/>
and most substantial turnpikes in Cuba.<lb/>
It is being built of the hardest flint rock<lb/>
from the new stone crusher, which is put<lb/>
down about six inches thick, after the<lb/>
road has been well graded. A compe-<lb/>
tent engineer is in charge of the work<lb/>
and is seeing that it is well done.</p>
<p>General Lee is taking a commendable<lb/>
pride in the new roadway, and is having<lb/>
the work pushed as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p>Parties who drive over the new road<lb/>
after it is complete will go to Quemados<lb/>
by Vedado, over the new bridge on the<lb/>
Almendares river.</p>
