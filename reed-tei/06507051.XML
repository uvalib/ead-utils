<salute>Dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>As you asked my opinion regarding the in-<lb/>
cluding of gratuities as part of the cost, I would think it is<lb/>
difficult to say, as there are two distinct ways of considering<lb/>
it. One could argue it ad infinitum and reach no conclusion.<lb/>
Really, I think you have solved it admirably by showing the<lb/>
amount so expended and then deducting from the total. Your way<lb/>
one can see all the costs and take their choice as to including<lb/>
the gratuities or not. That solves it.</p>
<p>About the Martinez question, I still think that he was<lb/>
so commonly known by his middle name of Martinez, even to Major<lb/>
Reed, that his last name was frequently forgotten.</p>
<p>Don't you think that some of the differences in consecu-<lb/>
tive case numbers could have been caused by some using the date<lb/>
of test, (application of mosquito or blood) and others, as I do,<lb/>
the date of attack and admittance to Y. F. Ward? Of course, my<lb/>
sole authority is a photostat of the Epidemic List sent to the<lb/>
Surgeon General, and I would consider that to be correct.</p>
<p>Of course you may send any of my letters to Doctor Hench<lb/>
if you desire. I can't imagine them being of any interest to<lb/>
him as he desires only factual statements, and with his research<lb/>
abilities, knows more about these things than I do. Yet--I feel<lb/>
that though you and I may not be able to make every name and<lb/>
date syncronize into an exact statement on everything and say:<lb/>
&ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; still <hi>we were there</hi>. We know things we cannot prove.<lb/>
For instance, someone sees the play, &ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo; and believes<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06507052"/>
(2)<lb/>
that the Cuban part fairly presents what transpired there<lb/>
and that the imitation Rudyard Kipling characters really repre-<lb/>
sent the volunteers. But anyone who was there knows this play<lb/>
is a poor caricature.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I've answered all your questions to the<lb/>
best of my ability and am flattered that you should consult me<lb/>
regarding them. Please let me know how things turn out, and<lb/>
always call on me if you really think there is any way I can<lb/>
be of assistance.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
