Mrs. Blossom Reed<lb/>
Blue Ridge Summitt<lb/>
Pennsylvania<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs. Reed:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It was so nice of you to write me expressing interest in our<lb/>
recent work. It is really going along very well and it has already been<lb/>
confirmed from several sources but we have much work ahead and the extreme<lb/>
rarity of the material is a great handicap which will be corrected as the<lb/>
months pass by.</p>
<p>I am so sorry to hear of the progressive illness of your mother.<lb/>
I hardly know whether or not to say that I wish for release of her spirit<lb/>
so that she may have a fuller life elsewhere, but I am greatly impressed<lb/>
by the devoted care which you have given her for so long.</p>
<p>As for the personal part of your letter, let me tell you the<lb/>
following: Somewhere I have a memorandum on the policy of the Walter<lb/>
Reed Memorial Association but at the moment I cannot lay my hands on it.<lb/>
I am sure, however, that it is the purpose of the Association to continue<lb/>
to do for your family what Walter Reed would want done and I am sure that<lb/>
after your mother's death your father would naturally want you and your<lb/>
brother to receive whatever help was necessary from the fund. That is<lb/>
certainly much more important than the erection of some small memorial<lb/>
which could not in any way compare to the monuments to your father now<lb/>
in existence. Rest assure that as long as I am a member of the board and<lb/>
so far as I am able to do so, the interests of his children will be the<lb/>
prime concern of the board.</p>
<p>I shall look up this point in the minutes of the previous meetings<lb/>
as soon as I can and let you know further.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
