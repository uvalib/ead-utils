<salute>My own, precious darling;</salute>
</opener>
<p>From<lb/>
early morning, I have been<lb/>
much perplexed with think-<lb/>
ing. Can you imagine the cause<lb/>
of my perplexity? I'll tell<lb/>
you. It is simply that I<lb/>
don't know with what I<lb/>
shall supply these pages<lb/>
in order to make them in-<lb/>
teresting. I <hi>haven't been<lb/>
to the City</hi>, since I last wrote;<lb/>
nor have I taken part<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01650002"/>
in any serenades or sailing<lb/>
excursions, or been to see<lb/>
any ladies, (I've had several op-<lb/>
portunities, but didn't improve<lb/>
them,) and hence these fruit-<lb/>
ful topics of discourse are<lb/>
wanting &amp; their loss is much<lb/>
felt. To tell the truth, I have been<lb/>
very lazy, during the past week-<lb/>
I have read but little and have<lb/>
not so much as looked into<lb/>
my French Grammar, nor do<lb/>
I intend to do so, until I<lb/>
get another and better one.<lb/>
It is disagreeable enough to<lb/>
have <add>to</add> study French without<lb/>
any drawbacks, and to pursue<lb/>
the study, under disadvan-<lb/>
tages, is simply intolerable.<lb/>
Excuse my forcible expressions.<lb/>
Having neither serenades <add>n</add>or<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01650003"/>
excursions to write about,<lb/>
what shall I say? If I were<lb/>
by your side, I would not be<lb/>
at a loss, as I could ea-<lb/>
sily say a thousand and one<lb/>
foolish things (<hi>this you will<lb/>
endorse, I'm sure</hi>) but the<del>n</del><lb/>
same expressions, committed<lb/>
to paper, would appear very<lb/>
insipid. I could fill several<lb/>
pages with telling the same<lb/>
old story, but I'm afraid<lb/>
you would grow weary with<lb/>
listening. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; you would<lb/>
exclaim, &ldquo;a woman doesn't<lb/>
care to <hi>forever</hi> hear that<lb/>
she is loved -- the song,<lb/>
too often sung, loses its<lb/>
enchantment.&rdquo; Now whether<lb/>
this is true or not, I am<lb/>
not quite sure, although<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01650004"/>
I am inclined to think that it<lb/>
is true, to a certain extent, and<lb/>
in certain cases. In others, I am<lb/>
confident that it is not the<lb/>
case. For instance, I don't be-<lb/>
lieve that the charming Mur-<lb/>
freesboro widow whom I saw<lb/>
at <add>a</add> distance, &amp; to whom <hi>you<lb/>
would not introduce me</hi>,<lb/>
(your object I never could pene-<lb/>
trate,) would ever<del>y</del> grow tired<lb/>
of hearing the <hi>ancient</hi> &amp; <hi>much<lb/>
counted</hi> Dr L.'s plaintive mur-<lb/>
murings! On the contrary, I be-<lb/>
lieve, that they would be &ldquo;as<lb/>
welcome as the cry, that<lb/>
told the Indian Isles were<lb/>
nigh, to the world-seeking<lb/>
Genoese; when the land-winds,<lb/>
from woods of palm<del>s</del>, and orange<lb/>
groves &amp; fields of balm,<lb/>
blew o'er the Haytien seas-&rdquo;<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01650005"/>
Before it escapes my memory,<lb/>
permit me to ask, how <del>do</del> <add>does</add> the<lb/>
<hi>venerable</hi> Dr (I wouldn't dare<lb/>
thus to allude to him did not<lb/>
many miles intervene, &amp; then<lb/>
he is <hi>so young</hi>,) progress in<lb/>
the estimation of the fascina-<lb/>
ting widow? Does she deign to<lb/>
smile upon him, or is it<lb/>
likely that he will take<lb/>
cold &ldquo;while shivering in the<lb/>
shade of beauty's frown&rdquo;?<lb/>
Does the gay &amp; sportive<lb/>
Mr Williams often cross<lb/>
his orb? Or has he aban-<lb/>
doned the field as lost? What<lb/>
friendly feelings must ex-<lb/>
ist between them! May the<lb/>
bravest win, and long may<lb/>
he live to bask in the sun-<lb/>
light of her smiles! May the<lb/>
words of the Poet, &ldquo;that man <del>I<lb/>
say</del> who hath a tongue I say<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01650006"/>
is <hi>no man</hi>, if with that tongue<lb/>
he cannot win <hi>a woman</hi>,<lb/>
serve to uphold the drooping<lb/>
spirits of him who meets<lb/>
defeat! Thus do I leave them<lb/>
in Fortune's care.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, last, I was<lb/>
entertained with a view of<lb/>
the Heavens, through the kind-<lb/>
ness of Lieut. Rossell. Of course<lb/>
I mean a<del>n</del> telescopic view-<lb/>
We took a peep at Mars --<lb/>
saw the beautiful rings<lb/>
of Saturn -- &amp; watched the<lb/>
movements of Luna as<lb/>
she pursued her trackless<lb/>
path through the immensity<lb/>
of space. I was most anx-<lb/>
ious to look at Jupiter,<lb/>
but unfortunately, it was<lb/>
too late at night to see him.<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01650007"/>
I felt sure that in looking <add>at</add><lb/>
him, <del>tha</del> I should have the<lb/>
exquisite pleasure of seeing<lb/>
the reflection of your darling<lb/>
face! and this would more<lb/>
than repay my evening's toil.<lb/>
Mind, or I will yet see you.<lb/>
Would that I was in Mur-<lb/>
freesboro, these charmings<lb/>
evenings-! I have never seen<lb/>
nights more beautiful-<lb/>
Early in the evening I take<lb/>
my chair out to the veranda<lb/>
&amp; so charmed am I with the<lb/>
silent beauty of the scene<lb/>
without, that I often find<lb/>
myself unconsciously watching<lb/>
the Heavens till a late<lb/>
hour. What an hour it<lb/>
is for reflection! And Oh!<lb/>
how my heart swells with<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01650008"/>
gratitude, when I think how<lb/>
fortunate my lot has been!<lb/>
Had I met with disappoint-<lb/>
ment and defeat at every turn<lb/>
in my life, still to have won<lb/>
your love, my darling E., is<lb/>
all that I can ask! For thou<lb/>
art my own, sweet Emilie,-<lb/>
&ldquo;with that name life's dearest<lb/>
hopes and memories Come&rdquo;!<lb/>
I trust that e're another moon<lb/>
shall wax &amp; wane, that <del>we</del><add>I</add><lb/>
may be permitted to gaze<lb/>
upon the beauties of nature<lb/>
in your society. At least, this<lb/>
is my expectation- I am afraid<lb/>
that if I postpone my visit<lb/>
till later, that I will be ordered<lb/>
away &amp; be deprived of all<lb/>
chance of coming. But of this,<lb/>
more at another time.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe<lb/>
me, my darling, your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
Excuse mistakes.
