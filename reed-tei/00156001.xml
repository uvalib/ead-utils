<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here we are in Freiburg<lb/>
eleven miles from the Rhine and on<lb/>
the border of the Black Forest. We<lb/>
came down on Monday from Paris to<lb/>
<unclear>Bale</unclear> or Basel in the northern corner<lb/>
of Switzerland. There I wrote a letter<lb/>
to you but in the hurry of starting<lb/>
I left it in <del>it</del> my room at the<lb/>
hotel I was very much provoked about<lb/>
it. We left Basel at four in the<lb/>
afternoon of Tuesday and walked<lb/>
to Kirchen where we stopped over<lb/>
night at an inn. It was a regular<lb/>
old German Gasthaus. After being<lb/>
shown to our room, <del>it</del> we went<lb/>
into the public-room where the<lb/>
assembled company all spoke to us<lb/>
and we soon entered into conver-<lb/>
sation, the landlord leading. He<lb/>
said he could once read English and<lb/>
he brought out an English grammar<lb/>
in German. We got a great deal of<lb/>
practice in German during the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00156002"/>
evening talk. The people here always<lb/>
take off their hats on entering a<lb/>
tavern and they always greet you<lb/>
on the road and are very kind<lb/>
about giving information about<lb/>
the roads. Yesterday it rained<lb/>
most of the time and we could<lb/>
only get as far as M&uuml;llheim,<lb/>
here we got a good nights rest<lb/>
with a good <del>dil</del> dinner and<lb/>
breakfast, all for about eighty<lb/>
cents a piece. This morning we<lb/>
walked over to Badenweiler <del>a</del><lb/>
which is back in the Black Forest<lb/>
about three miles. There is a<lb/>
fine <unclear>ruin</unclear> there and and some<lb/>
old Roman baths built in the<lb/>
second century. It is now a<lb/>
fashionable watering place with<lb/>
baths. From there we walked to<lb/>
<unclear>Staufen</unclear> where there is another<lb/>
ruined castle. These castles are on<lb/>
the tops of hills and can be seen<lb/>
for long distances. The valley of<lb/>
the Rhine is very broad here and<lb/>
we can see the Vosges mountains<lb/>
in the distance on the other side.<lb/>
This afternoon we walked up to<lb/>
Freiburg which is a very interesting<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00156003"/>
place with an old cathedral<lb/>
and a University. Tomorrow we<lb/>
will go on with our journey<lb/>
going toward Strasburg, but<lb/>
we will hardly be able to reach<lb/>
it in one day. I am not sure<lb/>
that we can go there although<lb/>
we shall be very near it as they<lb/>
are very particular about pass-<lb/>
ports in Alsace and Lorraigne and<lb/>
we have none. We will get<lb/>
to Heidelberg about Monday<lb/>
and there I hope to find letters as<lb/>
I directed them to be sent there.<lb/>
Before leaving Paris I received a<lb/>
letter from you and Uncle Tom.<lb/>
both of which I enjoyed very much.<lb/>
This is a very fine trip that we<lb/>
are taking the scenery is mag-<lb/>
nificent, and we are getting<lb/>
lots of practice in our German<lb/>
I speak it much better than I<lb/>
thought I could. I had a long<lb/>
talk with the land lady at M&uuml;llheim<lb/>
and I understood her very easily<lb/>
and had no trouble in making <unclear>her</unclear><lb/>
understand me. I am very sorry<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00156004"/>
that I did not get my letter off at<lb/>
Basel as you will not get a<lb/>
letter by that mail and I like<lb/>
to send one by every mail,</p>
<p>Give my love to all.</p>
