<p>dress on the part which the women<lb/>
played in the restoration of the little<lb/>
house which was the center of the<lb/>
ceremonies, but was unable to be<lb/>
present. Dr. Jones read a letter<lb/>
from Mrs. Taliaferro expressing her<lb/>
deep regret at being unable to take<lb/>
part in the services and gracefully<lb/>
transferring &ldquo;all the credit to the<lb/>
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny&rdquo;<lb/>
was played by the band, which had<lb/>
been grouped about the speakers'<lb/>
stand.</p>
<p>Dr. J. D. Clements paid a brief but<lb/>
glowing tribute to the memory of<lb/>
Dr. Reed, in introducing Dr. Law-<lb/>
rence T. Royster, of Norfolk, who<lb/>
spoke on &ldquo;What Walter Reed Means<lb/>
to Medical Research.&rdquo; Dr. Royster<lb/>
opened his remarks with the state-<lb/>
ment that &ldquo;birthplace of an immor-<lb/>
tal&rdquo; was being dedicated to future<lb/>
generations of the world, declaring<lb/>
that &ldquo;by common consent the name<lb/>
of Walter Reed is placed in that<lb/>
galaxy of brilliant investigators,<lb/>
which includes Pastuer, Koch, Lister,<lb/>
Jenner, VonBehring, Morton and<lb/>
Long; and the brilliance of the gal-<lb/>
axy is increased by the addition of<lb/>
his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker went into a detailed<lb/>
account of the early efforts of the<lb/>
great physician in his war with the<lb/>
yellow fever plague, of how he gave<lb/>
himself as a willing sacrifice to the<lb/>
cause of mankind, stating that<lb/>
though he has not to lose his life in<lb/>
his great fight, he risked it gladly,<lb/>
time and time again. Dr. Royster<lb/>
painted in glowing terms the charac-<lb/>
ter and the devotion of the man.</p>
<p>In concluding, the speaker declar-<lb/>
ed: Although he had not surrendered<lb/>
his life in the fight at the moment of<lb/>
victory, in spirit he had made the<lb/>
great sacrifice, in the interest of<lb/>
science and for humanity. Greater<lb/>
love hath no man than this, that he<lb/>
lay down his life for his friends.<lb/>
&ldquo;The spirit of research.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Dr. Royster took his seat amid<lb/>
the applause, the band struck up the<lb/>
martial strains of &ldquo;Dixie,&rdquo; which<lb/>
served to increase the clatter of ap-<lb/>
procation from the crowd.</p>
<p>In introducing Col. J. R. Kean, the<lb/>
Hon. S. Otis Bland, of this city, took<lb/>
occasion to say a few words in praise<lb/>
of the state and the county which<lb/>
&ldquo;mothered so illustrious a son.&rdquo; The<lb/>
Congressman expressed the hope that<lb/>
some day a history of Tidewater will<lb/>
be written by one of &ldquo;her own sons,&rdquo;<lb/>
declaring that when it is completed<lb/>
it will make &ldquo;an epic to challenge the<lb/>
admiration of the world.&rdquo; The speak-<lb/>
er declared that this section of the<lb/>
country has a heritage of which it<lb/>
may well be proud and that it has<lb/>
been said of its social life that it is<lb/>
the most hospitable and enchanting in<lb/>
America.</p>
<p>In introducing Colonel Kean, Mr.<lb/>
Bland referred to him as &ldquo;another<lb/>
distinguished Virginian, a warm,<lb/>
personal friend of Dr. Walter Reed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who served in the army<lb/>
with Dr. Reed and who was his in-<lb/>
timate friend opened his remarks<lb/>
with the statement that &ldquo;In the lives<lb/>
of great men two places have in<lb/>
all ages and among all peoples had<lb/>
a particular interest and sacred qual-<lb/>
ity that where they were born and<lb/>
that where, when life is ended their<lb/>
remains are laid to rest in the last<lb/>
sleep.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was my sad duty on a<lb/>
November day in 1902 to select a<lb/>
spot where Walter Reed was to rest<lb/>
a beautiful hillside in Virginia, over-<lb/>
looking the Potomac and the Capitol<lb/>
in that silent city where the soldier<lb/>
dead of the Republic sleep in their<lb/>
thousands of consecrated fields that<lb/>
once belonged to the great Captain<lb/>
Robert E. Lee. I feel it, therefore,<lb/>
a great privilege and honor to be<lb/>
present also at this spot where Wal-<lb/>
ter Reed was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker then went into a de-<lb/>
tailed account of the birth, early<lb/>
life and education of Dr. Reed, car-<lb/>
rying his hearers with the famous<lb/>
physician through his early life as<lb/>
an army doctor on the far flung<lb/>
frontiers of the nation when he was<lb/>
anything but famous, though even<lb/>
then interested in research and lay-<lb/>
ing the foundation upon which he<lb/>
was later to build his life's work,<lb/>
which now stands as an everlasting<lb/>
monument to him and to his pro-<lb/>
fession. He told of the great work<lb/>
which Dr. Reed and his assistants<lb/>
did in their investigation of the ty-<lb/>
phoid epidemic, continuing his theme<lb/>
until he reached the point where the<lb/>
man in whose memory he was speak-<lb/>
ing had taken up the battle against<lb/>
the dread yellow fever, which was<lb/>
ravaging the land. Every effort was<lb/>
made to check the disease all to no<lb/>
avail until finally after months of<lb/>
work and dangerous risks, Dr. Reed<lb/>
came to the conclusion that the<lb/>
mosquito was the transmitter of the<lb/>
germ. In one year after this dis-<lb/>
covery, the disease was wiped out.</p>
<p>The life work of the hero of the<lb/>
medical profession is summed up in<lb/>
the epitaph on his tomb, Col. Kean<lb/>
said, quoting: &ldquo;He gave to man con-<lb/>
trol of that dreadful scourge, yellow<lb/>
fever.&rdquo; The officer concluded with<lb/>
the statement. &ldquo;We are here today<lb/>
to make for Walter Reed that proud<lb/>
boast of the Roman poet. &lsquo;Exegi<lb/>
monumentum aere perennius&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Taliaferro then presented Mrs.<lb/>
Walter Reed, widow of the man who<lb/>
had been so finely eulogized by the<lb/>
speakers. Mrs. Reed rose and bowed<lb/>
amid a spontaneous burst of ap-<lb/>
plause. The chairman of the com-<lb/>
mission then introduced the Rev.<lb/>
James C. Reed, brother of the phy-<lb/>
sician, who thanked the Society and<lb/>
all concerned for what they had<lb/>
done to restore and perpetuate the<lb/>
birthplace of his illustrous brother.<lb/>
Dr. Reed then pronounced the bene-<lb/>
diction which concluded the program.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed, her guests and other<lb/>
special guests of the occasion then<lb/>
held an informal reception in the<lb/>
house, with tea being served by the<lb/>
Gloucester County Woman's club.</p>
<p>In addition to Dr. Reed's widow<lb/>
and brother, Dr. James C. Reed,<lb/>
among those present were several<lb/>
daughters of the Dr. James Reed,<lb/>
with a number of his wife's family<lb/>
and members of Dr. Reed's sister's<lb/>
family.</p>
<p>The Walter Reed Memorial Com-<lb/>
mission of the Medical Society of<lb/>
Virginia, for the Encouragement of<lb/>
Research, which holds title to the<lb/>
property consists of the following:<lb/>
Dr. E. C. S. Taliaferro, chairman,<lb/>
Norfolk; Dr. Clarence Porter Jones,<lb/>
secretary and treasurer, Newport<lb/>
News; Dr. Greer Baughman, Rich-<lb/>
mond; Dr. Halstead S. Hedges,<lb/>
Charlottesville; Dr. Garnett Nelson,<lb/>
Richmond.</p>
<p>The Woman's Club of Gloucester<lb/>
County will have charge of the prop-<lb/>
erty.</p>
<p>Belroi, the birthplace of Dr. Wal-<lb/>
ter Reed, which was yesterday dedi-<lb/>
cated as a national shrine to the<lb/>
memory of the man who gave his<lb/>
life to the research which was con-<lb/>
cluded with the discovery by the<lb/>
great army physician that yellow<lb/>
fever was carried by the mosquito,<lb/>
is now as nearly restored to its orig-<lb/>
inal state as was possible.</p>
<p>The little one and a half story<lb/>
frame house has been completely re-<lb/>
stored, inside and out. The house has<lb/>
been re-roofed, 
the two chimneys re-<lb/>
stored, with the original brick, The<lb/>
interior has been completely over-<lb/>
hauled and furnished, under the di-<lb/>
Gloucester County. Dr. Clarence<lb/>
Porter Jones, of the commission,<lb/>
stated that it was the hope of the<lb/>
society to be able to rebuild the log<lb/>
kitchen which stood in close proxim-<lb/>
ity to the house, and to erect a perm-<lb/>
anent fence about the grounds.</p>
