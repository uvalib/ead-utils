<salute>My Dear Doctor Kelly,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Letters from my<lb/>
brothers give very little more information<lb/>
concerning Walter's early life than I<lb/>
was already in possession of and I might<lb/>
have written you a week ago about what<lb/>
I shall now note down. My brother,<lb/>
Thomes Walk Reed, who lives in Kansas<lb/>
writes, and I may as well here give<lb/>
you my reason for rewriting his letter<lb/>
instead of sending it. By an unfortunate<lb/>
accident, he lost his right-hand<lb/>
when 41 years old and doesn't write<lb/>
as plainly with his left-hand as he<lb/>
used to do -- hence though I make him<lb/>
out finely, I was afraid you might have<lb/>
some trouble- He says &ldquo;From the time<lb/>
I entered the army in 1862 I was<lb/>
only with Walter short periods of time.<lb/>
When we lived in Charlottesville, I<lb/>
was in business with Antrim &amp; Son<lb/>
&amp; boarded with them the greater part<lb/>
of the time- Walter always impressed<lb/>
me with his manly ways far more<lb/>
than most boys of his age. In 1866<lb/>
when Pa first moved to Charlottesville,<lb/>
he was put in a private school taught<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02665002"/>
C1<lb/>
B3<lb/>
by a Mr: Abbott who was an A.H.<lb/>
of the University of Va. He limited himself<lb/>
to 20 pupils- His was a special course<lb/>
preparatory to the University, Walter<lb/>
was with Prof. Abbott two sessions, I<lb/>
think. He then entered the University<lb/>
under age, but permitted to do so because<lb/>
he had two brothers there. His intentions<lb/>
were to take the degree of A.M. and<lb/>
having made the standard in three or<lb/>
four of his studies he was refused<lb/>
his graduation papers because he<lb/>
was under age, being required to stand<lb/>
his examinations again after becoming<lb/>
old enough. He was indignant- He was<lb/>
at the time before the full faculty<lb/>
pleading his own case -- a boy not<lb/>
quite 16 years of age -- as you well<lb/>
know. After being refused his graduation<lb/>
papers by the faculty in the classes<lb/>
he had made, he turned to the Med-<lb/>
ical Board of the faculty and said to<lb/>
them, &ldquo;Gentlemen, I have changed my<lb/>
mind in regard to what I had intended<lb/>
to do -- take the degree of A.M- If I take<lb/>
the Medical Course &amp; make the<lb/>
standard, will you give me my<lb/>
diploma as an M.D.?&rdquo; They all<lb/>
nodded their heads with a smile<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02665003"/>
not thinking for a moment that he<lb/>
would perform such a task. He then<lb/>
turned to Dr. Maupin, Chairman of<lb/>
the faculty, and said, &ldquo;Dr, you have<lb/>
heard what these gentlemen say.<lb/>
Will you see that I have my degree<lb/>
of M. D. if I make the standard?&rdquo;<lb/>
Dr: Maupin replied that he would.<lb/>
Walter then said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, I hold<lb/>
you to your solemn pledge&rdquo; &amp; bowing<lb/>
to them, went out. I cannot remember<lb/>
now who it was that was present &amp;<lb/>
related the incident to me but whoever<lb/>
it was, said that he was very digni-<lb/>
fied &amp; made quite an impression.<lb/>
Walter at once applied himself to<lb/>
the task and graduated the next<lb/>
summer, third, in his class.</p>
<p>Dr: Maupin on presenting his<lb/>
diploma said the he was the youngest<lb/>
man ever graduated from the school<lb/>
but they were in honor bound to<lb/>
deliver him his diploma. There are<lb/>
two other incidents of his childhood<lb/>
that occur to me but they are hardly<lb/>
worth relating. When he was about six<lb/>
years old he was sent for the first time<lb/>
to a school in Farmville- Taught by Mr<lb/>
George E. Broker. Pa had asked Mr: Broker<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02665004"/>
C1<lb/>
B3<lb/>
to be very lenient with him and allow<lb/>
him to play out of doors as much as he<lb/>
thought he could do. He had two signs<lb/>
at the door- with &ldquo;out&rdquo; on one side and<lb/>
&ldquo;In&rdquo; on the other- Only two could be absent<lb/>
at once but Walter was not required to<lb/>
turn the sign- He could go out without<lb/>
permission &amp; soon he staid out all<lb/>
the time. Mr: Broker sent for him one<lb/>
day &amp; had him brought in. As the little<lb/>
fellow marched to his seat Mr. Broker<lb/>
said, Walter, you are like the little<lb/>
boy that went to see his grandmother,<lb/>
aren't you, as Walter tried to explain<lb/>
that he had been out only twice that<lb/>
day- We were all curious to hear how<lb/>
the comparison would be- Mr: Broker<lb/>
soon told us that the little boy went<lb/>
only twice a year to see his grandmother<lb/>
and staid six months each time!<lb/>
Of course the whole school had a hearty<lb/>
laugh at his expense &amp; he seemed to<lb/>
enjoy it as much as we did. The other<lb/>
incident was when Pa was recommend<lb/>
ing the merits of the old fashioned <hi>Va</hi><lb/>
corn bread one day at a meal. He said<lb/>
if we would eat it that it would help<lb/>
us to grow fast &amp; make us strong<lb/>
men. We were not impressed with<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02665005"/>
2<lb/>
his recommendation but he insisted<lb/>
upon helping each one with a small<lb/>
piece for encouragement. As he handed<lb/>
the piece to Walter it slipped &amp; fell in<lb/>
the waiter with the cups &amp; saucers. He<lb/>
said! There, my son, is your piece in<lb/>
Mother's waiter! Walter replied, &ldquo;Yes,<lb/>
sir, let it stay there&rdquo; and it stayed!<lb/>
Our father, full of humour, enjoyed<lb/>
the joke on himself, hugely.</p>
<p>When I lost my hand the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
day of Sep- 1883, my thoughts turned<lb/>
to Walter almost immediately- I<lb/>
begged Kit (our brother Christopher)<lb/>
to wire for him- He was stationed<lb/>
at Omaha, Nebraska, at the time<lb/>
&amp; was packed up &amp; on the eve of<lb/>
a move. Yet he came to me at once<lb/>
arriving one Sunday morning. Opening<lb/>
the door of my room &amp; throwing his<lb/>
cloak from his shoulders, he knelt<lb/>
by my bedside &amp; kissed me time<lb/>
&amp; again. He handled my poor arm<lb/>
as tenderly as a woman could have<lb/>
done &amp; for the four days he spent<lb/>
with me, did all that was possible<lb/>
to be done. I was suffering horribly<lb/>
when he came &amp; threatened, I feared,<lb/>
with blood poisoning. He took out<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02665006"/>
C1<lb/>
B3<lb/>
all the stitches that had been put<lb/>
in &amp; treated it as an open wound.<lb/>
with such success that it healed<lb/>
quite rapidly. I was grievouly dis-<lb/>
appointed when last in Virginia<lb/>
that I did not see Walter. I had<lb/>
fully intended to go to Washington<lb/>
but circumstances over which I had<lb/>
no control, prevented.&rdquo; L. W. Reed-</p>
<p>Dear Doctor,</p>
<p>This is all that refers<lb/>
in any way to Walter in my brother's<lb/>
letter -- but speaking of Farmville<lb/>
reminded me of a small incident<lb/>
in which Walter was concerned- Farm-<lb/>
ville is a great place for the tobacco<lb/>
trade- Farmers bring in their loose<lb/>
weed &amp; it is sold &amp; stored in large<lb/>
warehouses- One afternoon in company<lb/>
with other small boys, (&amp; larger ones<lb/>
too, I suspect), Walter went the rounds<lb/>
of the warehouses- As the boys sampled<lb/>
or tasted the tobacco, he did so too &amp;<lb/>
was made very sick- The boys saw<lb/>
him ill &amp; hurried to carry him<lb/>
home -- frightened out of their wits<lb/>
too, to think of the dire punishment<lb/>
ahead of them when their seniors<lb/>
should find out what they had<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02665007"/>
been doing- On their way home they<lb/>
begged, &ldquo;Walter if it kills you, don't<lb/>
tell on us,&rdquo; &amp; the poor little fellow<lb/>
promised, if it killed him he would<lb/>
not tell! Another incident of his<lb/>
child life which showed his tender,<lb/>
affectionate nature occurred about 2<lb/>
years afterwards- I had had quite<lb/>
a spell of illness at my parents'<lb/>
home in Bedford City- He came<lb/>
up to my room one morning to see<lb/>
me &amp; to inquire how I was- When<lb/>
I said, &ldquo;I think that I'm really<lb/>
a little better this morning, my darling&rdquo;<lb/>
he replied, with beaming face, &ldquo;I had<lb/>
rather heard that sound from your<lb/>
lips than to have had a check for<lb/>
$500.00 put in my hands this morning&rdquo;<lb/>
I have often thought that was quite<lb/>
an appreciative speech from a boy of<lb/>
his age- Just here occurs another<lb/>
small incident that I have often<lb/>
smiled over in thinking of him. My<lb/>
mother told me about it sometime<lb/>
after it occurred. When he was about<lb/>
six years old she was about to<lb/>
punish <add>him</add> for something &amp; as she ap-<lb/>
proached him, switch in hand, he<lb/>
fell at her feet &amp; with small arms<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02665008"/>
C1<lb/>
B3<lb/>
clasped around her knees, he looked<lb/>
up with a most beseeching expression<lb/>
on his face &amp; exclaimed, &ldquo;O, my<lb/>
<hi>beautiful</hi> mother, how can you<lb/>
punish your <hi>dear</hi> little boy&rdquo;?<lb/>
He won the day!</p>
<p>He joined the Methodist Church<lb/>
in Charlottesville in Feb: 1866-<lb/>
when a little over fourteen years<lb/>
old - but was only a resident of<lb/>
Charlottesville until after his<lb/>
graduation. Inasmuch as his various<lb/>
duties <add>called him</add> from place to place, I do not<lb/>
think he kept up his connection<lb/>
with the visible Church. He was<lb/>
brought up &ldquo;in the nurture and<lb/>
admonition of the Lord&rdquo; -- lovingly,<lb/>
tenderly, but firmly rooted &amp; grounded<lb/>
in the principles of our holy Christianity-<lb/>
I cannot remember an act of his life<lb/>
inconsistent with the highest principles<lb/>
of morality. The fruits of the Spirit,<lb/>
Love, Joy, Peace -- Long suffering -- goodness<lb/>
gentleness, charity were exhibited in his<lb/>
daily life. As I think I mentioned<lb/>
in my former letter, I was twelve years<lb/>
his senior &amp; the only sister for twenty<lb/>
seven years, (another sister then being<lb/>
born by my father's second marriage)<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02665009"/>
3<lb/>
and I can honestly say that from<lb/>
the day of his birth- through his baby,<lb/>
hood, boyhood &amp; manhood, his<lb/>
life was one of sweetness &amp; love.</p>
<p>Often in thinking of him I have<lb/>
been impressed with his wonderfully<lb/>
interesting personality. Never ostenta-<lb/>
tious, never seeming to realize that he<lb/>
was doing anything uncommon, he was<lb/>
always up to the standard in whatever<lb/>
he undertook. He was the possessor<lb/>
of a good strong constitution -- rarely<lb/>
ever sick, except with the usual chil-<lb/>
dren's diseases -- was always in a<lb/>
good humour -- cheerful &amp; bright,<lb/>
ready for work or play as occasion<lb/>
called forth. He was fond of horses,<lb/>
dogs &amp; all other domestic animals &amp;<lb/>
lived for the greater part of his boyhood<lb/>
in the country when he was familiar<lb/>
with all such- He had a pet of his<lb/>
own -- a beautiful brown pointer -- his<lb/>
companion at work or play. When the<lb/>
weather was pleasant &amp; the grass<lb/>
green in the yard, I have seen him<lb/>
rolling over &amp; over on the ground with<lb/>
his dog until you could scarcely<lb/>
tell which was which &amp; then standing<lb/>
up they would play like boys together.<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02665010"/>
C1<lb/>
B3<lb/>
He was fond of riding &amp; swimming<lb/>
&amp; on one occasion his swimming<lb/>
came near costing him dearly.<lb/>
It was in the Spring of 1865 &amp;<lb/>
Sheridan's raiders were sweeping<lb/>
through our part of Virginia, carrying<lb/>
away the remaining stock &amp; doing<lb/>
damage generally. Directed by their<lb/>
parents, my brothers, Christopher &amp; Walter,<lb/>
with other neighborhood boys, had taken<lb/>
all of their horses to hide from the<lb/>
Union forces. They found a place<lb/>
in the bend of a river some distance<lb/>
from home &amp; quite far away from<lb/>
any human habitation &amp; amid the<lb/>
trees &amp; shrubbery, thought they were<lb/>
perfectly secure. So one bright morning<lb/>
leaving their animals well tied, <add>they</add> went<lb/>
for a plunge into the river -- when lo!<lb/>
in the midst of their enjoyment, <del>the</del><lb/>
a band of raiders, led to their hiding<lb/>
place by a trusted servant; dashed<lb/>
in upon them &amp; the poor fellows lost<lb/>
their all &amp; themselves too! However, I<lb/>
suppose the raiders finding most of<lb/>
of their captives &ldquo;nothing but boys&rdquo;,<lb/>
&amp; of small value, released their prison<lb/>
ers &amp; my two brothers came home<lb/>
after awhile -- much to our joy &amp;<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f02665011"/>
&amp; relief for the report spread like<lb/>
wild fire &amp; reached us at home, that<lb/>
everything &amp; everybody had been taken.<lb/>
After my father's removal to Char-<lb/>
lottesville &amp; the death of my own mother<lb/>
which occurred there shortly afterwards,<lb/>
I saw very little of Walter except on<lb/>
visits to me. These he made as often<lb/>
as opportunities presented &amp; on these<lb/>
occasions we had the most delightful<lb/>
reunions. He had a fine memory &amp;<lb/>
was a good talker &amp; as far as possible,<lb/>
he would live over his life in narration,<lb/>
for I was as interested in everything<lb/>
he did &amp; said as anything <hi>alive</hi><lb/>
could be. How I wish now that I had<lb/>
taken notes of the various accounts of<lb/>
his experiences that he gave me! Some<lb/>
of his stories bordered on tragedies --<lb/>
the experiences of his life in New York --<lb/>
among the slums &amp; the hospitals &amp;<lb/>
his travels in the West were sometimes<lb/>
attended with much danger. But he<lb/>
never shirked a duty for fear of con-<lb/>
sequences- He crossed deserts, evaded<lb/>
rivers in the path of duty, but I could<lb/>
venture the assertion that he never ceased<lb/>
to be thoughtful of those about him, no<lb/>
matter how great the danger, But<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f02665012"/>
C1<lb/>
B3<lb/>
I suppose his wife has supplied<lb/>
you with some of the most interesting<lb/>
&amp; thrilling incidents of his travels in<lb/>
the West. Talking about him last<lb/>
summer to my brother J. C. Reed, who<lb/>
was at the time in Ashland, I said<lb/>
that I wished so much that Walter<lb/>
had kept a journal of his <del>his</del> life &amp;c<lb/>
&amp; my brother replied that he had done that<lb/>
very thing with a view to writing some<lb/>
articles after his retirement -- when he<lb/>
would have the leisure to do so, but that<lb/>
in one of his moves his notebook was<lb/>
lost- No doubt we could have found<lb/>
many items of interest to us now that<lb/>
he is gone &amp; also much of pleasure &amp; profit<lb/>
to others. He was full of simplicity in his<lb/>
estimate of himself, I think:- Seeing in the papers<lb/>
various accounts of his yellow fever discovery,<lb/>
I wrote, congratulating him &amp;- In his<lb/>
reply after telling me of his trip to Cuba,)<lb/>
something about his experiments in which<lb/>
he knew I would be greatly interested, he<lb/>
says, &ldquo;Of course, when one has left<lb/>
wife &amp; baby, faced death &amp; won a victory,<lb/>
it makes him happy, but it shouldn't<lb/>
turn his head. He should only thank<lb/>
God that his life hasn't been in vain,<lb/>
&amp; go about his business. That's what<lb/>
<pb n="13" id="f02665013"/>
4<lb/>
I am now doing.&rdquo; I could go on in<lb/>
this way talking about him for<lb/>
pages but am really alarmed<lb/>
at the length of this letter- You<lb/>
will know how to excuse me<lb/>
Doctor, when I tell you that I<lb/>
have lost one of the best friends<lb/>
&amp; brothers that ever lived- Since<lb/>
my widowhood in 1889, Walter's<lb/>
expression of sympathy with &amp;<lb/>
care for me &amp; my children were<lb/>
always touching &amp; beautiful- His<lb/>
counsels were wise &amp; always followed<lb/>
with delight &amp; his words of cheer<lb/>
were often accompanied with sub-<lb/>
stantial help. He was generous<lb/>
in the extreme &amp; only when the books<lb/>
are opened, I trow, will the records<lb/>
of his good deeds be known. And<lb/>
now again thanking you, Doctor,<lb/>
for your very great kindness to<lb/>
us all &amp; with prayers for your great<lb/>
success in every work of life, I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours</salute>
