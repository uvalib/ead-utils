General William C. Gorgas,<lb/>
The Highlands,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Gorgas:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I sent a letter to your New York address,<lb/>
61 Broadway, which came up from Tampa on the same<lb/>
train I did--naturally it will be a day or so be-<lb/>
for you get it.</p>
<p>I stopped off here intending to see you if<lb/>
by chance you were here. Perry tells me that you<lb/>
are here, but are engaged today (Pan-American<lb/>
Financial Congress). As it isn't suitable weather<lb/>
for elderly gentlemen-dressed for South Florida-<lb/>
to wander around Washington in, I am going on<lb/>
home,-if only to get into warmer clothes, and con-<lb/>
sequently write this.</p>
<p>I can make my arrangements to go with you in<lb/>
the early part of <del>April</del> <add>February</add>. It will require my<lb/>
application for waiting orders, which I will put<lb/>
in today <del>or when I hear from you.</del></p>
<p>I would like to know, (1) the scope of the<lb/>
work in which I will be engaged and as much in de-<lb/>
tail as you can give. The traveling kit I am to<lb/>
provide depends on this, that is where I am likely<lb/>
to go and for how long; (2) If you know yet, on<lb/>
what day you sail and from what port and by what<lb/>
vessel.</p>
<p>I could come over and see you at any time if<lb/>
you think I had better do so. I am to be over at<lb/>
the Bureau part of next week on a board to revise<lb/>
quarantine regulations, so it would be convenient<lb/>
enough.</p>
<p>Adios</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00822006"/>
<p>2</p>
<p>For some reasons--viz. I had not hurt my back--I wish I had gone<lb/>
with you last August (when Perry thought I was not well enough to go),<lb/>
I was able to do field work from August 4th. on, and did do it until I<lb/>
hurt my back--November 16th.--up to which time I was perfectly well.</p>
<p>However, I had missed doing what will lessen the malaria in the<lb/>
U. S. by at least 25,000 cases--possibly 50,000--per annum and I judge<lb/>
that was better worth doing than what I had done in yellow fever work.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly your friend,</salute>
