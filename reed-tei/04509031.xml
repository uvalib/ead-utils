Dr. Pedro Nogueira<lb/>
Marti 219, Marianao<lb/>
Havana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Pedro:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received your letter of November 7 within the hour and am answering it<lb/>
promptly. I believe I sent you Mrs. Cooke's name and address. I think it<lb/>
would be very fine if he and Hanberry received the Finlay Order. I am<lb/>
writing Hanberry today, not mentioning the Finlay Order of course, but telling<lb/>
him that he will be hearing from you shortly and that he should be making<lb/>
plans to go to Cuba.</p>
<p>I am happy to know that some of the invitations have already gone out. If<lb/>
they are printed, I would like to have one very much as a souvenir to keep<lb/>
with my papers, in addition to the full program which you expect to send me<lb/>
shortly. I am desperately trying to finish a chapter on the use of cortizone<lb/>
and ACTH in rheumatic diseases, which was due the first of November, so that<lb/>
I have written nothing yet on my little talk for Havana; however I have been<lb/>
thinking it over in my mind and if I don't send you ahead of time the copies<lb/>
you request, I will arrive with several copies of a Spanish translation all<lb/>
ready for you as I will have it done here by our Spanish interpreters.</p>
<p>It will be nice if the President of the Republic can be present on the occasion.<lb/>
That will add great distinction. I remember many years ago being presented to<lb/>
him briefly when he was inspecting a new hospital. My Cuban host told him of<lb/>
my interest in Camp Lazear and Mr. Batista said that when the plans were completed<lb/>
he would like to be present on the occasion. That was when he was president<lb/>
before, about 1940 I believe. If you wish to remind him of his &ldquo;promise&rdquo; to<lb/>
me, please do so.</p>
<p>I shall be delighted to have a few extra programs to send to interested friends.</p>
<p>Dr. Ames' widow is Mrs. Jessie Daniel Ames, Wrens Nest, Tryon, North Carolina.<lb/>
I am not sure how much of a family they had.</p>
<p>I do hope that the appropriate committee considers worthy for the Finlay decora-<lb/>
tion at least a few of the others that were mentioned, especially General Truby<lb/>
and perhaps General Reed.</p>
<p>I am very happy that the Sternberg book finally arrived. I cannot understand<lb/>
what <unclear>held</unclear> it up. I had sent a tracer on it. Yes, I have the other Sternberg<lb/>
book, also the Gorgas book but I will bring them with me.</p>

<salute>Always sincerely,</salute>
