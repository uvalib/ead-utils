<p>HORRIFIC.....IF IT'S TRUE!</p>
<p>Yellow fever transmitted to Spanish immigrants<lb/>
by mosquitos!</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>ALERT THE AUTHORITIES!</p> 
<p>A rumor of an act so horrific, repugnant<lb/>
and monstrous has come to us, that<lb/>
hesitating to believe in its existence,<lb/>
almost daring to deny it, we do not<lb/>
hesitate to record it -only by way of<lb/>
rumor-in our columns, because in that<lb/>
way the popular version will arrive<lb/>
directly and quickly to the authorities,<lb/>
and they; if as we hope the deed turns<lb/>
out false, will dispel alarm and if- what<lb/>
we do not believe- it were true, will<lb/>
impose upon its authors an exemplary<lb/>
punishment, whose importance is at the<lb/>
height of the monstrous magnitud of the<lb/>
crime.</p>
<p>Here is what is said:</p>
<p>As is known, for some time now, the<lb/>
current of Spanish immigration to this<lb/>
island has increased.  The large portion<lb/>
of those immigrants, as is natural, aren't<lb/>
immune to yellow fever.</p>
<p>Those who stay a short time in<lb/>
Triscornia are offered work in an<lb/>
American camp in los Quemados,<lb/>
promising them a peso daily, and are<lb/>
carried in groups "partidas" of 30 or 40<lb/>
men.</p>
<p>And here enters the horrible part of the<lb/>
story.</p>
<p>At night, when the immigrants have<lb/>
finished their work, they are enclosed in<lb/>
some special rooms and in then a large<lb/>
number of mosquitos that have bitten<lb/>
individuals with yellow fever are<lb/>
released.  The object of it, is to study<lb/>
practically if the contagion originates or<lb/>
can originate through the innoculation of<lb/>
those bites.  If the worker becomes sick<lb/>
and dies, the experiment has<lb/>
demonstrated the fact; in the opposite<lb/>
case, it has completely cleared up that<lb/>
fear.</p>
<p>Such is, referred to as briefly as possible,<lb/>
the case.</p>
<p>If, unfortunately, its existence is proven,<lb/>
it would be the most monstrous case of<lb/>
humanitarian... savagry that we've ever<lb/>
witnessed.  To do experiments in &aacute;nima<lb/>
vili on the body of people, and to people,<lb/>
though poor, honest, hard working and<lb/>
good, who come to a country in search<lb/>
of wealth, well-being and work,<lb/>
believing to have found all of the<lb/>
guarantees of civilized life and of free<lb/> 
peoples, would be unheard of, and would<lb/>
demand (as La Discusi&oacute;n demands it in<lb/>
the name of Cuban opinion, for that very<lb/>
reason that it deals with a modest, hard<lb/>
working dignified element of the<lb/>
Spanish colony) such a punishment, that<lb/>
its exemplary nature erase forever all<lb/>
fear that the vile crime- for it has no<lb/>
other name - could repeat itself.</p>
<p>In any case, we believe it useless to<lb/>
repeat that, in our judgment, the act is<lb/>
not possible; but in case it were true, our<lb/>
personal and juournalistic integrity<lb/>
makes us declare, in which refers to the<lb/>
intervention of the higher authorities in<lb/>
the case, and for the very reason that our<lb/>
opposition to the misguided acts of<lb/>
General Wood has been clear and<lb/>
frank- that we are persuaded that<lb/>
neither complicity nor tolerance, but also<lb/> 
not even knowledge of that sad point<lb/>
could the military governor, General<lb/>
Wood or Col. Scott, who worthily<lb/>
substitutes in his absence, have.</p>
