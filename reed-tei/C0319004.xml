<salute>Dear Jimmy:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of April 13th. would have been answered earlier had I not<lb/>
been too sick to write. The &ldquo;Guardian Devil&rdquo; of the Carter family played<lb/>
a much resented April Fool joke by giving me a bad set-back, since which<lb/>
date I've been living (existing rather!) on soft diet and aromatic spirits<lb/>
of ammonia and trying to do some work on the side. This latter bacause I<lb/>
am far behind the schedule I set myself last fall and want to finish my work<lb/>
on the book before hot weather at any cost.</p>
<p><del><hi>In</hi></del> <hi>Re</hi> a reprint of Father's article in the New Orleans Medical Journal<lb/>
of May 1900, I agree with you that it would be an excellent thing to have<lb/>
one (or a photostat of one) for the contemplated exhibit of Americana in<lb/>
medicine at the New York Academy of Medicine. Indeed, Dr. Frost--to whom<lb/>
I showed <del>my</del><add>your</add> letter--agreed with me that there should be three of Father's<lb/>
publications in this exhibit, as they were all planned to-gether and written<lb/>
about the same time, although the one to which you allude was the first of<lb/>
the lot. These three would be:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1: A Note on the Interval between Infecting and Secondary Cases of Yellow<lb/>
Fever from the Records of the Yellow Fever at Orwood and Taylor, Miss., in 1898<lb/>
New Orleans Medical Journal, May 1900. Also Ann. Rept. Marine Hospt.<lb/>
Service 1900.</item>
<item>2: Period of Incubation of Yellow Fever in Man. (Planned with (1) and (3)<lb/>
and written about the same time--the trilogy forming a complete work).<lb/>
Published in Medical Record <del>Feb.-or-M--</del>1901. Original manuscripts<lb/>
deposited as a permanent loan at the Library of the Surgeon General of the<lb/>
Army.</item>
<item>3: A Note on the Spread of Yellow Fever in Houses. Extrinsic Incubation.<lb/>
Medical Record, June 15, 1901. Also in Ann. Rept. M. H. S. 1900 (Appeared in<lb/>
print probably some time in 1901; certainly after Nov. 1900).</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>I am herein enclosing my only copy of # 3: (Extrinsic Incubation). I can<lb/>
find no reprints of Nos. 1 and 2, but believe that you may find them (in addi-<lb/>
tion to the original MSS) at the Library of the Surgeon General of the Army or<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0319005"/> 
or-<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
possibly--at the Library of Congress. In either case one would have to<lb/>
get photostats (as would be advisable with the reprint on Extrinsic In-<lb/>
cubation, as I have no other copy). I don't know how much this would cost,<lb/>
but if the Academy of Medicine (or the Service) can't arrange for this to<lb/>
be done, I judge I can &ldquo;swing&rdquo; it. They charge about 15 cents a page for<lb/>
photostats--don't they?</p>
<p>Dr. Frost thinks that you should also have a complete bibl<del>i</del><add>o</add>graphy of<lb/>
Father's writings on yellow fever. He compiled one last fall and we will<lb/>
send you a carbon copy if one is available. If not, he will have one of<lb/>
his secretaries make an extra copy for you. I shall also send you a re-<lb/>
print of his article (read in Melbourne) on<lb/>
The Chance of the Extension of Yellow Fever to<lb/>
Asia and Australia. (1925?)<lb/>
as these were not printed until long after the article was read and I have<lb/>
not yet distributed them.</p>
<p>With dear love to Chase and the children and all sorts of good wishes<lb/>
to you, each and every one.</p>
