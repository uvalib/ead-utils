Mr. John A. Owen, Jr.<lb/>
President, Virginia Alpha Chapter<lb/>
University of Virginia, Department of Medicine<lb/>
Charlottesville, Virginia<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Owen:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just returned from a busy Eastern trip. I enjoyed my brief<lb/>
visit to Charlottesville. By separate post I am sending you a reprint which<lb/>
might interest you.</p>
<p>If it isn't too much trouble or expense, would you kindly send me<lb/>
four of the photographs which were taken of you, Dan Jordan, President Darden<lb/>
and me? I should like to keep one and send the others to the relatives of<lb/>
Walter Reed.</p>
<p>Two or three days after I left Charlottesville, Mrs. Hench and I<lb/>
had dinner at the home of Walter Reed's son General and Mrs. Walter Lawrence<lb/>
Reed in Washington, and a day later, enroute to Mercersburg, Pennsylvania,<lb/>
we visited Walter Reed's widow and daughter, now living at Blue Ridge Summit,<lb/>
Pennsylvania. Mrs. Walter Reed is 92 years old. They were interested to<lb/>
hear of my visit to Charlottesville.</p>
<p>May I repeat in this letter the suggestion that I made to you casually<lb/>
by word of mouth - that your fraternity, Alpha Omega Alpha, could honor itself<lb/>
by honoring the three University of Virginia men who were so closely associated<lb/>
with Walter Reed; namely, General Jefferson Randolph Kean (incidentally the<lb/>
oldest living decendent of Thomas Jefferson), Dr. Robert P. Cooke, of Lexing-<lb/>
ton, Virginia and Mr. John J. Moran of Havana. I do hope that you will not<lb/>
think my suggestion presumptuous but I believe that honorary memberships in<lb/>
Alpha Omega Alpha for these three men are worth considering. General Kean<lb/>
and Doctor Cooke of course became physicians and General Kean was one of the<lb/>
great physicians of the Army. Johnny Moran only took one year at the medical<lb/>
school at the University of Virginia when his funds ran out, but he had already<lb/>
made a contribution to the human race, the likes of which few graduates have the<lb/>
opportunity to make.</p>
<p>I realize that others of your chapter may not consider this suggestion<lb/>
appropriate, therefore, I do not expect any reply, as I don't want to embarrass<lb/>
anybody by my suggestion.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
