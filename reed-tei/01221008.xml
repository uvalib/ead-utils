<salute>Dear Doctor Heiser:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of February 9th., just received.</p>
<p>My recollection is that I said that the breeding places of<lb/>
Stegomyia were in collections of water in artificial containers<lb/>
or things that simulate them and this would include holes in rocks:<lb/>
<del>knot</del><add>rat</add>-holes and axile of leaves, I think.</p>
<p>What I was skeptical about--and rather more than &ldquo;a trifle<lb/>
skeptical&rdquo;--was that they bred in mud holes when their normal<lb/>
breeding places, as above given, were available.</p>
<p>I have read Haworth's article. The same breeding in palm<lb/>
trees: &ldquo;cocked hat trees&rdquo; (<hi>Dracaenia</hi>) and similar trees and shrubs<lb/>
has been reported by men from West Africa and especially by Bacot<lb/>
(a most careful epidemiologist). We also found them in <hi>Colocassia</hi><lb/>
in Panama, though not &ldquo;of sanitary importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stegomyia aegypti were not found so as to be of sanitary im-<lb/>
portance in West Africa in cocoanut palms. I am inclined to think<lb/>
that in the hedges of <hi>Dracaenia</hi> <add><unclear>much</unclear> in Sierra <unclear>Leone</unclear></add> they may be. With other Stegomyia,<lb/>
naturally, we have, so far, no concern.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01221009"/>
<p>concern.</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>The yellow fever vector is not likely to breed in places exposed<lb/>
to full light or wind. Connor and some others have reported their<lb/>
general absence in the high unshaded cisterns: on the roofs and<lb/>
scaffolds in Central America and Mexico and, as I recall, in Guaya-<lb/>
quil. This may be the explanation to their rarity in cocoanut and<lb/>
other palm trees.</p>
<p>I should rather suspect the travelers palm as capable of pro-<lb/>
ducing them so as to be of sanitary importance than any other. It<lb/>
is rarely tall: its leaf axils contain a considerable amount of<lb/>
water (not much under <unclear>1/2</unclear> a pint) which is deep enough in them to be<lb/>
well shaded and dark.</p>
<p>Some, possibly considerable, investigation of the biology of<lb/>
this vector will probably have to be made in West Africa before<lb/>
the work of control can be planned to the best advantage. Did I<lb/>
tell you that, induced by the paper I gave you, Stevens wrote me<lb/>
that MacFie had been sent to West Africa to &ldquo;check up&rdquo; on the Ste-<lb/>
gomyia breeding there? I have, too, a letter from Gordon (R. Mount)<lb/>
of the Sir Alfred Lewis Jones Research Laboratories, Sierra Leone,<lb/>
stating that he is sending me reprints of some articles on Stegomyia,<lb/>
&ldquo;which may have escaped&rdquo; my &ldquo;notice.&rdquo; If there is anything new in<lb/>
them I will send them to the I. H. B. Gordon, as you know, was<lb/>
the man who made the experiments to determine the preferential time of<lb/>
feeding of Stegomyia (day or night) at Manaos--in 1921, I think.</p>
<p>I very greatly enjoyed seeing you and hope you never fail to<lb/>
call in when you are in Washington.</p>
<p>With very best remembrances from Laura and myself,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely your friend,</salute>
