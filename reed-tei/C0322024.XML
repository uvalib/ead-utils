<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>As I told you in my letter of July 2nd., work on the purely medical<lb/>
(and last) section of the bibliography of the History of Yellow Fever was<lb/>
begun on Sunday, July 1st. Since that time Miss Brown and I have made<lb/>
considerable progress therein at the Library of Congress.</p>
<p>I have also had the very real pleasure of seeing Colonel Ashburn and<lb/>
talking over with him the best plans for the work remaining to be done on<lb/>
the medical bibliography. Colonel Ashburn agrees with me that I had best<lb/>
stay at the Library of Congress as long as possible--i. e. as long as I<lb/>
can get medical references from its files to clear up before I move to the<lb/>
Library of the Surgeon General of the Army. This, because the facilities<lb/>
for such work at the Library of Congress are greater (as to working space<lb/>
etc.) than he can offer me at the Library of the Surgeon General, even <del>with</del><add>when</add><lb/>
the special priveleges of staying after hours: taking books home etc. are<lb/>
taken into account, all of which he has most kindly and helpfully said he<lb/>
would <del>give</del><add><unclear>afford</unclear></add> me. Colonel Ashburn has also offered to give special desk<lb/>
space to myself and Miss Brown. Indeed, no one could have been more kind<lb/>
and thoughtful than he has shown himself.</p>
<p>Washington is a &ldquo;burning, fiery furnace&rdquo; these days, despite which<lb/>
fact Miss Brown and I put in ten hours of intensive work on July 4th.--this<lb/>
not counting time off for meals. It was pretty strenuous &ldquo;going,&rdquo; but will<lb/>
save us several days time <del>as</del><add>taking into account how</add> our respective working hours are arranged. I<lb/>
do hope you're having better weather in New York. Its really quite dread-<lb/>
ful here, but so long as one can &ldquo;carry on&rdquo; efficiently comfort is a minor<lb/>
consideration.</p>
<p>Dr. Thayer continues to be most helpful in facilitating and expediting<lb/>
my work. Indeed, I can never adequately express my appreciation of all that<lb/>
he has done, and is doing, in this respect.<lb/>
etc.</p>
