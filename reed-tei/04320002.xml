<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This will acknowledge receipt of your note of October 20th advising<lb/>
me that it will be impossible for you to attend the annual meeting of the<lb/>
Walter Reed Memorial Association this year. We very much regret that you cannot<lb/>
come.</p>
<p>I am enclosing herewith copy of the letter being sent out to all the<lb/>
members of the Board advising them of the date and place of the annual meeting<lb/>
and calling attention to the copy of your letter to me under date of October 20th.</p>
<p>I went down to see General Bliss at the Office of the Surgeon General a<lb/>
few days ago relative to the plaque to be placed on the building at Ft. Leslie<lb/>
McNair and also with respect to your information concerning Building #1 in Cuba.<lb/>
We will of course take these matters up at the annual meeting, but General Bliss<lb/>
told me he would be very glad to do anything possible to get some action with<lb/>
respect to Building #1.</p>
<p>I anticipate going to Ft. McNair in the next few days with General<lb/>
Reed and we will see the Commanding Officer with regard to placing the plaque<lb/>
on the building. I talked with General Kean last week and we thought it might<lb/>
be well to have the plaque made of metal with the lettering to be <add>of</add> suitable size<lb/>
and visibility to be able to be read from the sidewalk. Tentatively, we thought<lb/>
the following inscription might be satisfactory: "Walter Reed died in this building,<lb/>
then a hospital, November 23, 1902. We would like very much to have your suggestions<lb/>
concerning the wording and any changes in it you consider desirable.</p>
<p>We shall look forward with great pleasure to seeing you when you do come<lb/>
to Washington later in the year.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
