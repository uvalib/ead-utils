Colonel Paul Hayes<lb/>
Chief Medical Consultant<lb/>
Department of the Army<lb/>
Office of the Surgeon General<lb/>
Washington 25, D.C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Hayes:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I think you have known of my interest and hobby - the whole story of the<lb/>
conquest of yellow fever. Permit me to send you, confidentially, a copy<lb/>
of the letter I have just sent to General Armstrong. I do not think you<lb/>
need to do anything for me as I believe General Armstrong knows of my<lb/>
interest and is quite sympathetic with it because, after all, what we<lb/>
have done has, I hope, made the Cubans more sympathetic to the work of<lb/>
the U. S. Army Commission. But I do want you to have the letter in<lb/>
case, for any reason, General Armstrong should mention the matter to<lb/>
you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. HENCH, M.C.</signed>
PSH:alc<lb/>

P.S.: Can I bother you about a matter which some might consider small<lb/>
and perhaps foolish. Although I never went overseas during my four<lb/>
years of service in the Army and never had the opportunity even to win<lb/>
a good conduct medal, I have on occasion wished that I had picked up<lb/>
the medal which everyone in the Army got, I believe the medal of the<lb/>
second World War, analogous to the Victory Medal of World War I. I<lb/>
was demobilized hastily at the Pentagon in January 1946 and waited<lb/>
around for nothing, I can assure you. Since then, I have occasionally<lb/>
heard of this medal but don't even know its name and don't know how<lb/>
or where to apply for it. Frankly and honestly, I would like to collect<lb/>
one to leave to my kids. Would you be so good as to humor a very un-<lb/>
heroic &ldquo;ex-medical officer&rdquo; and tell me if I am all wet on this and, if<lb/>
I am not, tell me where I should apply? I retain from Army days my<lb/>
allergy to making five carbon copies and perhaps when I am in Washington<lb/>
in February I could simply go to some office in the Pentagon with my<lb/>
discharge paper and make a simple thing of it.<lb/>
If I can find them, I will bring along with me in February the snapshots<lb/>
that I took of the very delightful weekend that I spent with you when<lb/>
I took that consultant's trip for the Medical Corps.<lb/>
