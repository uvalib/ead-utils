<salute>Dear Gorgas:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I want to explain the embroglio of this morning.</p>
<p>I wrote you Sunday evening. The next morning Blue asked me<lb/>
what I thought of going to Guatemala to look into the yellow fever<lb/>
situation--said that you and Heiser were going. I told him I was<lb/>
too tired to think just then, but was well and could do whatever<lb/>
was advisable--I had just gotten up from Sabine, Texas.</p>
<p>Last evening, about 8.30, I got a telegram to expect orders<lb/>
for Guatemala: said you would said December 5th., and to go over to<lb/>
the Bureau for conference and passport. I put things in train to<lb/>
leave <add>and</add> went to the Bureau. Found it was intended for me to go<lb/>
with your party for the purpose of getting data on the yellow fever<lb/>
situation in Central America to determine what measures the Service<lb/>
should take in maritime quarantine. Naturally, this would be<lb/>
very much better determined next March or April than <unclear>now--yellow</unclear><lb/>
fever is not a threat to the U. S. during the winter--no Stegomyia<lb/>
being active in our ports--and it would be a very wise man who<lb/>
could now predict at all accurately what will be the condition of<lb/>
any Central American port next summer. Especially is this true<lb/>
since, as I understand, measures to eradicate the disease are--and<lb/>
will be taken. I persuaded Dr. Blue of this and then called you<lb/>
up.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00813053"/>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>Frankly, I would have liked very well to have taken a &ldquo;paseo&rdquo;<lb/>
with you, but that is all it would have been and there is a lot<lb/>
of malaria work I want to get organized on a peace basis and I don't<lb/>
feel I have any right to loaf on it. If I had, I have been at home<lb/>
so little since January 5th. that I had rather spend any leisure<lb/>
I will have with my family. I will be extremely glad to go with<lb/>
you when there is any service I can render.</p>
<p>Found both of your letters on my return. I felt pretty cer-<lb/>
tain thay you could <unclear>doonothing</unclear> about Henry. He just played in<lb/>
bad luck. There is no reason why he should feel so badly about it,<lb/>
but he is no very philosophic.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly your friend,</salute>
</closer>
