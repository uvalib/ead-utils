Dr: Kelly,<lb/>
<salute>Dear sir,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just rec'd<lb/>
from my old home in Farmville, the<lb/>
old daguerreotype from which was<lb/>
copied one of the pictures sent to you.<lb/>
On observing it closely, I think the<lb/>
original is the better picture of Walter<lb/>
&amp; thinking perhaps in these days of<lb/>
improved photography you might<lb/>
get a better likeness of him I send<lb/>
it to you. Do not think me presump-<lb/>
tuous, Dr, when I tell you that I<lb/>
think this one scene in his<lb/>
small boy life might interest<lb/>
you -- these four sons of a country<lb/>
minister- You can readily see their<lb/>
plain surroundings- their heads<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02664002"/>
2<lb/>
adjusted against an old wood<lb/>
house- The hand that the oldest<lb/>
one has around the shoulder of<lb/>
his little brother, was left on<lb/>
a battlefield around Sharpsburg<lb/>
in 1863. The two middle ones<lb/>
were young Confederate soldiers<lb/>
&amp; laid down their arms with Gen-<lb/>
R.E.Lee at Appomattox C.H.<lb/>
I rec'd your letter by Miss<lb/>
Latimer several days ago &amp; will<lb/>
do my best to give you as<lb/>
accurate an account of Walter's<lb/>
boyhood as I can obtain <del>&amp;</del> from my<lb/>
own personal contact with him.<lb/>
I was twelve years his senior<lb/>
&amp; married &amp; left my parent's home<lb/>
when he was nine years old &amp;<lb/>
hence though on frequent long<lb/>
visits back to my parents &amp;<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02664003"/>
3<lb/>
<add>I</add> say much of him, yet to give<lb/>
you as good a letter as I could, I<lb/>
have written to my older brothers<lb/>
particularly, to send me some<lb/>
contribution of their own. I have<lb/>
never written anything except in a<lb/>
private way &amp; my story I fear, will<lb/>
have to be in the way of a personal<lb/>
letter &amp; the truth is, I don't know<lb/>
how to condense- Hence I will tell<lb/>
you just here that you may not be<lb/>
able to use what I shall write &amp;<lb/>
I will not be at all hurt if you<lb/>
should not see fit to use it <add>at</add> all.<lb/>
Again, thanking you most sincerely<lb/>
for your very great kindness I am</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours most respectfully</salute>
<signed>Laura Reed Blincoe</signed>
Many thanks for<lb/>
copy of Baltimore Sun. I sent your article<lb/>
to my Brother living in Kansas.<lb/>

<p>whether they would be of any<lb/>
particular use to Dr: Kelly<lb/>
as showing the bouyancy of<lb/>
his spirits under all difficulties<lb/>
I remember some sweet little<lb/>
incidents of his life when<lb/>
a child -- his love &amp; constancy<lb/>
&amp; good will, for he was an<lb/>
ideal boy, always full of good<lb/>
humour &amp; ready for work or play<lb/>
just as the occasion demanded.<lb/>
Once when I had been very ill<lb/>
at my father's home in Bedford --<lb/>
he came into my room quite<lb/>
early in the morning &amp; inquired<lb/>
&ldquo;Sis, how do you feel this morning&rdquo;?<lb/>
To which I replied, &ldquo;I think I'm<lb/>
a little better, my darling,&rdquo; he<lb/>
immediately clapped his little<lb/>
hands (he was only ten years old)<lb/>
together &amp; said, &ldquo;I had rather<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02664005"/>
6<lb/>
heard that sound from your<lb/>
lips than to have had a check<lb/>
for $500.00 placed in my hands&rdquo;!<lb/>
I thought that was quite a speech<lb/>
from a small boy &amp; a poor one<lb/>
at that &amp; I always cherished<lb/>
it in my heart of hearts- But he<lb/>
was always doing &amp; saying the<lb/>
right thing from his babyhood<lb/>
up to latest act- I was nearly<lb/>
twelve years his senior -- he was<lb/>
the youngest of my own mother's<lb/>
children &amp; always the idol of<lb/>
all our hearts. The last time I<lb/>
saw him in life was in Farmville<lb/>
In 1897- As we stood by our dear<lb/>
old father I remarked &ldquo;O, Walter<lb/>
he just longed to see his dear<lb/>
boy once more but he said &ldquo;The<lb/>
U.S. government owns my boy<lb/>
&amp; I can't see him when I wish&rdquo;<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02664006"/>
7<lb/>
To which W. replied, &ldquo;If I had<lb/>
known his condition no govern-<lb/>
ment under the sun could have<lb/>
kept me from my father&rdquo; Many<lb/>
other sweet &amp; precious things he<lb/>
said which will be remembered<lb/>
as long as my poor old life<lb/>
lasts- For fifty one years <unclear>&amp;</unclear><lb/>
more my life has been bound<lb/>
up in his &amp; now as its sands<lb/>
are running long -- having just<lb/>
passed my 63<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> birthday,<lb/>
I know the separation from<lb/>
him &amp; others gone before will<lb/>
not be for my long- And I rejoice<lb/>
at the happy prospect &amp; pray<lb/>
that the remaining years of my<lb/>
life may be spent in the fear<lb/>
&amp; love of God &amp; in good deeds<lb/>
to those around me. I realize that<lb/>
you &amp; I have much to live for.</p>
