<salute>Dear Col. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thanks for the photos. I won't need<lb/>
any more of them except the one of Mrs T.<lb/>
&amp; me with my masterpiece in wood working.<lb/>
I would like a couple more of that one.</p>
<p>I have no relatives by the name<lb/>
of Trubey and certainly no nephews<lb/>
by that or any other name. I do<lb/>
have a few relatives by the name<lb/>
of Truby. There are Trubys in Ohio<lb/>
and Pennsylvania but they are not<lb/>
relatives of mine. Our tribe is all<lb/>
centered in and near Buffalo, N.Y. I<lb/>
wonder where Melvin F. Truby is from?<lb/>
If you run across him please find<lb/>
out for I have never heard of anyone<lb/>
<del>by</del> with that name.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed Lampson's book. It<lb/>
tells much that I know about and is,<lb/>
therefore, very interesting. As to the &ldquo;<hi>cadence</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
I think it most tiresome. It is a<lb/>
<hi>novel</hi> pure &amp; simple but it is based<lb/>
on a mass of facts. Unfortunately the,<lb/>
facts are placed in the mouths of various<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06401094"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
characters in the story regardless as to who<lb/>
uttered them originally. This distorts things<lb/>
dreadfully and helps to perpetuate false<lb/>
statements. He also adopts everything every<lb/>
writer has <del>to</del><add>said</add> without regard to the facts.<lb/>
An example of this is the swearing &amp; foul<lb/>
language used by Sidney Howard in his<lb/>
&ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo;. Our medical officers never<lb/>
were guilty of that and even the language<lb/>
of the enlisted men was never at the low<lb/>
standard which Howard depicted.</p>
<p>I was astounded at the mass of reading<lb/>
Lampson had to do to get all the stuff in<lb/>
his story. He must have had all the old news-<lb/>
papers of the Gorgas family as well as all<lb/>
letters, reports etc which they had. How <hi>energetic</hi><lb/>
he must have been. Reminds me in that<lb/>
respect of one Philip S. Hench, <hi>but unlike him</hi><lb/>
in that he publishes everything regardless<lb/>
as to whether it is true or not. Of course<lb/>
he labels it a <hi>novel</hi> and therefore, even if<lb/>
it is in quotation marks, it at once loses<lb/>
value for historical purposes. The average<lb/>
reader can not separate the wheate from the chaff.</p>
<p>I have used a blue pencil in making<lb/>
remarks in the book. I hope that I have<lb/>
not disfigured it too much. When my book<lb/>
comes out you can compare my version on<lb/>
many points with those of the author. I hope<lb/>
you will be able to locate him and get the<lb/>
source of some of his info.</p>
<p>My daughter &amp; her little family will be here on<lb/>
the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. So we are all agog. Her husband is<lb/>
the grandson of the Late Col. Lauis a La Gorde, who was<lb/>
Chief Surgeon at Siboney, Cuba (see Lampson's book).</p>
<p>No news re my book, but should get info. soon.,</p>
