<salute>Dear Mr. Moran,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have left your letter unanswered because I was giving myself time<lb/>
to make sure that I could finish the job, which got postponed after my visit<lb/>
to Havana by an engagement in Hollywood and by some other work I had to do.<lb/>
I have just finished it and it goes on the market tonight. I shall know in<lb/>
a few days whether or not any manager is interested in producing it.</p>
<p>I have to tell you one thing. I found that I could not stick to the<lb/>
actual facts as closely as I should have liked to do and at the same time make<lb/>
a play in which the characters were interesting from the beginning. I had to<lb/>
make up a story about the soldiers, a story which would run along with the<lb/>
experiment and keep both elements going together until they finally meet at<lb/>
the moment of volunteering. Now, although my story is not a very sensational<lb/>
one, I naturally hesitated to represent you, Kissinger, Folk and Jernegan as<lb/>
doing anything you never did and for that reason I gave the four of you new<lb/>
last names. I have written a foreword to the play which describes the actual<lb/>
happenings and your part in them by name and have said in conclusion that the<lb/>
play insofar as the soldiers are concerned is to be taken rather as a celebration<lb/>
than a representation of your heroic conduct. I don't expect any of you to<lb/>
object to this change of names. It cannot be very comfortable to think of an<lb/>
actor walking around a stage impersonating oneself and inevitably getting it<lb/>
all wrong. I will let you know what the managers say about the play and when<lb/>
if ever it is to be produced.</p>
<p>I still look back on my three days in Havana last winter as a very<lb/>
pleasant time, though I have pangs of conscience when I remember how you let me<lb/>
impose on your generosity. The world is going forward very nicely with me<lb/>
considering the times. I hope that you are not having any more troubles than<lb/>
you can swing and that you and your wife and those beautiful Irish nieces who<lb/>
speak the wrong languages are all enjoying the best of health.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Faithfully yours,</salute>
<signed>Sidney Howard</signed>.
