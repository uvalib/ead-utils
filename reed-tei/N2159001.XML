<p>NO OTHER MODE OF INFECTION</p>

<p>PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 26.--That the<lb/>
mosquito serves as the &ldquo;intermediate<lb/>
host&rdquo; for the parasite of yellow fever, and<lb/>
that it is highly probable that the disease<lb/>
is only propagated through the bite of this<lb/>
insect, is the conclusion reached by a<lb/>
board of medical officers who went to<lb/>
Cuba in the Summer of the present year<lb/>
to make a study of the dread disease.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Medical Journal will to-<lb/>
morrow publish a summary of the results<lb/>
of their investigations. The board was<lb/>
composed of Dr. Walter Reed, surgeon,<lb/>
United States Army, and Dr. James Car-<lb/>
roll, Dr. A. Agramonte, and Dr. Jesse W.<lb/>
Lazear, all acting assistant surgeons of<lb/>
the United States Army. A tragic feature<lb/>
of the expedition was that Dr. Lazear him-<lb/>
self gave up his life before the work was<lb/>
done, having died of yellow jack on the<lb/>
evening of Sept. 25. Dr. Carroll also con-<lb/>
tracted the disease, but recovered.</p>
<p>When the board reached Cuba an epi-<lb/>
demic of yellow fever was prevailing in<lb/>
the town of Quemados, thus furnishing an<lb/>
opportunity for clinical observations and<lb/>
for bacteriologic and pathologic work.<lb/>
The cases studied during this epidemic had<lb/>
been diagnosed by a board of physicians,<lb/>
selected largely by reason of their famil-<lb/>
iarity with yellow fever. This board con-<lb/>
sisted of Drs. Nicolo Silverio, Manuel He-<lb/>
rera, Eduardo Angles, Acting Assistant<lb/>
Surgeon Roger P. Ames, and Dr. Lazear.</p>
<p>The board says in the &ldquo;preliminary<lb/>
note,&rdquo; as the article in The Philadelphia<lb/>
Medical Journal is termed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must call attention to the fact that<lb/>
Dr. Agramonte, whenever he performs an<lb/>
autopsy in this room, [the hospital dead<lb/>
room,] is always attended by a young sol-<lb/>
dier of the Hospital Corps, United States<lb/>
Army, who is detailed for that purpose,<lb/>
and whose duty it is to assist and after-<lb/>
ward to tend to the cleaning of the autop-<lb/>
sy table. This soldier, a non-immune<lb/>
American, was present when Dr. Carroll<lb/>
was there, and remained afterward to at-<lb/>
tend to his duties. He has not contracted<lb/>
yellow fever by his duties in this room<lb/>
from day to day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our own experience would seem to ac-<lb/>
cord with others, viz., that attendance upon<lb/>
autopsies and the handling of portions of<lb/>
organs of yellow fever cases removed to<lb/>
the laboratory is unattended with danger.<lb/>
Certainly the three non-immune members<lb/>
of this board, up to the time of these mos-<lb/>
quito inoculations had, during the past<lb/>
three months, come in close contact with<lb/>
the dead bodies and organs of yellow fever<lb/>
cases, freely handling and examining these<lb/>
organs, including the small intestines, even<lb/>
kept at thermostat temperature for twenty-<lb/>
four hours, without contracting the dis-<lb/>
ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Carroll was bitten at 2 P. M. Aug.<lb/>
27, 1900, by Culex fasciatus. This particu-<lb/>
lar mosquito had bitten a severe case of<lb/>
yellow fever on the second day of the dis-<lb/>
ease twelve days before; a mild case of<lb/>
yellow fever on the first day of the at-<lb/>
tack, six days preceding; a severe case of<lb/>
yellow fever on the second day of the at-<lb/>
tack four days before, and a mild case<lb/>
of yellow fever on the second day of the<lb/>
attack two days before inoculation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll remained well until the aft-<lb/>
ernoon of Aug. 29, when he was overcome<lb/>
by lassitude, and developed a very severe<lb/>
case of yellow fever.</p>
<p>An American, twenty-four years old, res-<lb/>
ident in Cuba, was bitten on the forenoon<lb/>
of Aug. 31 by the same mosquito that had<lb/>
bitten Dr. Carroll four days before. He<lb/>
also contracted a very severe case of the<lb/>
fever.</p>
<p>The story of Dr. Lazear's illness and<lb/>
death is told in the following language:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Lozear was bitten on Aug. 16, 1900,<lb/>
by a mosquito, (Culex fasciatus,) which<lb/>
ten days previously had been contaminated<lb/>
by biting a very mild case of yellow fever,<lb/>
(fifth day.) No appreciable disturbance of<lb/>
health followed this inoculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Sept. 13, 1900, (forenoon,) Dr. La-<lb/>
zear, while on a visit to Las Animas Hos-<lb/>
pital, and while collecting blood from yel-<lb/>
low fever patients for study, was bitten<lb/>
by a Culex mosquito (variety undeter-<lb/>
mined.) As Dr. Lazear had been previ-<lb/>
ously bitten by a contaminated insect with-<lb/>
out after-effects, he deliberately allowed<lb/>
this particular mosquito, which had set-<lb/>
tled on the back of his hand, to remain un-<lb/>
til it had satisfied its hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the evening of Sept. 18, five days<lb/>
after the bite, Dr. Lazear complained of<lb/>
feeling &lsquo;out of sorts,&rsquo; and had a chill at<lb/>
8 P. M.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Sept. 19, 12 o'clock noon, his tem-<lb/>
perature was 102.4 degrees, pulse 112; his<lb/>
eyes were injected and his face suffused;<lb/>
at 3 P. M. temperature was 103.4 degrees,<lb/>
pulse 104; 6 P. M., temperature 103.8 de-<lb/>
grees and pulse 106. Jaundice appeared, on<lb/>
the third day. The subsequent history of<lb/>
this case was one of progressive and fatal<lb/>
yellow fever, the death of our much-la-<lb/>
mented colleague having occurred on the<lb/>
evening of Sept. 25, 1900.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Dr. Lazear was bitten by a mosquito<lb/>
while present in the wards of a yellow<lb/>
fever hospital, one must, at least, admit<lb/>
the possibility of this insect's contamina-<lb/>
tion by a previous bite of a yellow fever<lb/>
patient. This case of accidental infection<lb/>
therefore cannot fail to be of interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the summing up of the board's<lb/>
preliminary note:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ourselves, we have been profound-<lb/>
ly impressed with the mode of infection<lb/>
and with the results that followed the bite<lb/>
of the mosquito in these three cases. Our<lb/>
results would appear to throw new light on<lb/>
Carter's (Dr. Henry R. Carter's) observa-<lb/>
tions in Mississippi, as to the period re-<lb/>
quired between the introduction of the first<lb/>
(infecting) case and the occurrence of sec-<lb/>
ondary cases of yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we here, for the first time, record<lb/>
a case in which a typical attack of yellow<lb/>
fever has followed the bite of an infected<lb/>
mosquito, within the usual period of incu-<lb/>
bation of the disease, in which other<lb/>
sources of infection can be excluded, we<lb/>
feel confident that the publication of these<lb/>
observations must excite renewed interest<lb/>
in the mosquito theory of the propagation<lb/>
of yellow fever, as first proposed by Fin-<lb/>
lay.&rdquo;</p>
