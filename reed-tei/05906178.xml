<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>First, I wish to thank you for the very kind letter<lb/>
which you wrote to Dr. Fred Rankin. I will give Dr. Rankin two<lb/>
days to think it over and then write him, sending you a carbon of<lb/>
my letter.</p>
<p>With respect to the original letters of Dorothy Dix,<lb/>
I certainly would like to have them but I would not wish to have<lb/>
to spend much money for them.</p>
<p>As to the identification of the so-called anonymous<lb/>
figure in the Yellow Fever painting, the one whom we wish to call<lb/>
Jernigan at your suggestion, was really put there by Cornwell because<lb/>
he wanted an interesting face with a mustache. It is actually the<lb/>
face of one of the men photographed on the steps of the Officers'<lb/>
Quarters whose name I do not recall. The resemblance is not too<lb/>
striking but I do not think we will have any difficulty if we call<lb/>
him Jernigan. Jernigan wore a mustache but, of course, I know<lb/>
nothing about the color of his hair.</p>
<p>The seated figure on the porch might, from the stand-<lb/>
point of historical justice, be Dr. Henry Carter or Roger Ames. I<lb/>
do not have pictures of either of these two men.</p>
<p>At any rate, we will hold up our printing of the A.<lb/>
M.A. inserts until we hear from you. It is possible for us to do<lb/>
this as we are printing the insert for HYGEIA separately, for it<lb/>
only carries the name of the painting and the artist. All other<lb/>
material for HYGEIA which concerns the painting will be in the text.</p>
<p>I believe it might be well for you to write to Dr.<lb/>
Fishbein direct and give him your suggestions (which he will turn<lb/>
over to Miss Vernon) for the unnamed figures so that these may be<lb/>
identified in any way you choose in the HYGEIA article. I do not<lb/>
believe it is too late for them to make a correction even though<lb/>
they were going to use the identifications made in the NEW YORK<lb/>
SUNDAY MIRROR page.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Withington and I hope to attend the meet-<lb/>
ing of the Wisconsin Medical Society at Madison September 10-12<lb/>
but as is general with us it is difficult to know definitely more<lb/>
than a day or two ahead.</p>
<p>I have no more of the colored proofs of the painting<lb/>
as they have all been framed but I am enclosing two of the small<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f05906161"/>
-2-<lb/>
proofs such as will be used with the HYGEIA article.</p>
<p>Again I wish to thank you for the very kind letter<lb/>
to Dr. Rankin.</p>

P.S. You would be amused at the trouble we are having with our<lb/>
artist in getting the actual press printing job done. He is so<lb/>
choosy about the coloring that he has our printer pretty well up<lb/>
in the air. We are trying to follow his ideas as closely as poss-<lb/>
ible but artists don't know much about printing and seem to expect<lb/>
miracles.<lb/>
