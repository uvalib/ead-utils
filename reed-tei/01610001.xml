<salute>Miss Lawrence,</salute>
</opener>
<p>It is the<lb/>
hour of morning, but such<lb/>
a morning! The sun has<lb/>
hid his face, as if to in-<lb/>
dicate his unwillingness<lb/>
to longer shine on an<lb/>
ungrateful world: a heavy<lb/>
fog hangs, like a pall, over<lb/>
the &ldquo;City of Churches&rdquo;; the<lb/>
winds sigh mournfully, as<lb/>
they pass, bearing on their<lb/>
bosom the sighs and pe-<lb/>
titions of earth's poor, friend-<lb/>
less creatures, and repeat-<lb/>
ing the oft-told story of<lb/>
&ldquo;Man's inhumanity to Man&rdquo;;<lb/>
the rain-drops descending<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01610002"/>
thick and fast from the<lb/>
dark, overhanging clouds<lb/>
complete the scene; a<lb/>
scene as uninviting as<lb/>
it well could be.<lb/>
Who, at such a time, would<lb/>
neglect to thank his Maker<lb/>
for the provision of a com-<lb/>
fortable home against the<lb/>
&ldquo;contending elements,&rdquo; or<lb/>
<del>would</del> fail to breath a<lb/>
silent prayer that He,<lb/>
who &ldquo;tempers the winds to<lb/>
the shorn lambs,&rdquo; would<lb/>
also protect the houseless,<lb/>
homeless wanderer.</p>
<p>Several causes<lb/>
have contributed to my<lb/>
delay in writing.<lb/>
First, this thought<lb/>
occurred to me -- In<lb/>
writing so often, am<lb/>
I not laying too great<lb/>
a burden on you? Or, in other<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01610003"/>
words, am I not converting<lb/>
into labor what should<lb/>
otherwise serve as a source<lb/>
of recreation? I am certain<lb/>
that the same thought has<lb/>
occurred to you more<lb/>
than once. Now to speak<lb/>
plainly, I would not have<lb/>
the correspondence become<lb/>
irksome to you for the<lb/>
whole world and all that<lb/>
therin is. I hope you under-<lb/>
stand me, for I would not<lb/>
have you misconstrue my<lb/>
meaning. Pray don't think<lb/>
that I have drawn such<lb/>
a conclusion from anything<lb/>
contained in your letters,<lb/>
for such is not the case.<lb/>
My only reason for alluding<lb/>
to the subject <del>w</del> is due to<lb/>
my anxiety lest I may be<lb/>
taxing your time too much<lb/>
by writing so frequently.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01610004"/>
I know that it must con-<lb/>
sume much valuable time, &amp;<lb/>
now that you have a former<lb/>
school-mate with whom you<lb/>
can pass so many pleas-<lb/>
ant hours, your time will<lb/>
be doubly valuable. This<lb/>
solution of the problem has<lb/>
occurred to me. Permit me<lb/>
to answer your letters as<lb/>
promptly as I choose, and<lb/>
in return, reply when it<lb/>
is most suitable to you,<lb/>
and in no way allow your<lb/>
other pursuits to be inter-<lb/>
fered with. I anticipate<lb/>
the arrival of your letters<lb/>
with much pleasure, but I<lb/>
would not have you con-<lb/>
clude from this that the<lb/>
longer the anticipation, the<lb/>
greater the pleasure, &amp;<lb/>
hence not write at all.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01610005"/>
Anticipation long continued<lb/>
brings suspense and<lb/>
suspense is, of all<lb/>
things, the least to<lb/>
be endured -- &ldquo;Hope deferred<lb/>
maketh the heart sick.&rdquo;<lb/>
You cannot now fail to<lb/>
fully comprehend my<lb/>
words. And yet, I regret<lb/>
that I have mentioned the<lb/>
subject. I am afraid you<lb/>
will begin to think that I<lb/>
am tiring of the correspon-<lb/>
dence. By thus thinking, you<lb/>
could <add>not</add> do me greater injury.<lb/>
By all that is good and true,<lb/>
such are not my feelings,<lb/>
nor would I do aught to<lb/>
interrupt what has been<lb/>
to me so extremely agree-<lb/>
able. But I know, Miss<lb/>
Lawrence, that human na-<lb/>
ture is so peculiar, and that<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01610006"/>
we are so apt to magnify<lb/>
mole-hills into mountains.<lb/>
In fact were it anyone else<lb/>
than yourself, I should tear<lb/>
up this letter and begin<lb/>
anew. As it is, I have such<lb/>
confidence in your good<lb/>
sense that I am well-pur-<lb/>
suaded <del>that</del> you <add>will</add> attribute<lb/>
my words <del>soely</del> <add>solely</add> to a desire<lb/>
to prevent the correspondence<lb/>
from becoming burdensome<lb/>
to you. If you do not approve<lb/>
of my proposition<del>s</del>, by all<lb/>
means, say so, and I will<lb/>
lend a ready ear to any<lb/>
suggestions you have to<lb/>
make, even though you<lb/>
should tell me &ldquo;to mind my<lb/>
own business.&rdquo; I would be<lb/>
only <add>too</add> <del>to</del> happy to hear<lb/>
that you do not con-<lb/>
sider my letters too<lb/>
frequently written.<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01610007"/>
My second excuse is but the<lb/>
repetition of the same, old<lb/>
story -- <hi>ill-health</hi> -- Alas! I am<lb/>
so harrassed! What to do<lb/>
surpasses the &ldquo;infinite of<lb/>
thought.&rdquo; At no time of my<lb/>
life did I ever appreciate<lb/>
more forcibly the statement<lb/>
that, &ldquo;time and tide wait<lb/>
for no man-&rdquo; <hi>I must study --</hi><lb/>
not a moment to lose -- and<lb/>
it is this same studying<lb/>
that has all along delayed<lb/>
my convalescence. Sick!<lb/>
Why I haven't drawn an<lb/>
unsound breath for years!<lb/>
but <hi>now</hi>, when I need all<lb/>
my strength, lo! it fails<lb/>
me! Is it not enough to<lb/>
disturb the smooth current<lb/>
of one's thoughts? It is like<lb/>
attempting to climb a hill<lb/>
with too great a burden.<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01610008"/>
But what am I do? Health<lb/>
or no health I <hi>must</hi> stand<lb/>
my examination in January.<lb/>
Language would fail to<lb/>
describe my chagrin and<lb/>
mortification, were I to be<lb/>
prevented from so doing<lb/>
by reason of sickness.<lb/>
Somebody would call me<lb/>
fickle, and accuse me of<lb/>
not carrying out my pur-<lb/>
poses, and this I am de-<lb/>
termined shall not be<lb/>
said- I have been fickle<lb/>
years ago, but I have put<lb/>
aside childish things, and,<lb/>
at present, I do not aban-<lb/>
don my plans, unless some<lb/>
good reason offers. Of<lb/>
course, I would not persist<lb/>
in doing one thing when<lb/>
I found that by abandoning<lb/>
it, I might gain a better.<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01610009"/>
Still, I believe that when<lb/>
a person determines<lb/>
to accomplish an end,<lb/>
that he should put<lb/>
forth all honest effort, nor<lb/>
turn aside unless for the<lb/>
best of reasons; and if<lb/>
he meets with defeat, let<lb/>
him accept it like a man,<lb/>
remembering that many <del>a</del><lb/>
better men have found<lb/>
themselves in a like sit-<lb/>
uation. At all events, I shall<lb/>
pursue my course till<lb/>
every prop is knocked from<lb/>
under me -- &ldquo;Sufficient unto<lb/>
the day is the evil therof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now to repent<lb/>
of my misdoings, if such<lb/>
they can be called.<lb/>
Miss Emilie (patience! what<lb/>
have I said? Your name es-<lb/>
caped me before I was<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01610010"/>
aware of it- I don't like to begin<lb/>
another sheet &amp; write it all over<lb/>
again -- it is such a labor -- besides<lb/>
will you not permit me to<lb/>
be less formal and call you<lb/>
Miss Emilie?) I was going to<lb/>
say, I am ever so sorry if<lb/>
my reference to you in my<lb/>
last letter occassioned you<lb/>
sadness. I need a lecture,<lb/>
I know, for speaking so<lb/>
boldly- You remember that<lb/>
the poet has said; &ldquo;it is<lb/>
the heart and not the brain<lb/>
that unto the highest doth<lb/>
<del>attend</del> attain;&rdquo; and I sup-<lb/>
pose he might have sub-<lb/>
stituted &ldquo;boldest&rdquo; for &ldquo;highest&rdquo;<lb/>
with equal truth and propriety.<lb/>
I am sure you<lb/>
consider me extremely<lb/>
rude -- in fact, I<lb/>
feel just like a bear!<lb/>
But you know I never should<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01610011"/>
have paid you such com-<lb/>
pliments, had I not firmly<lb/>
believed every word I uttered.<lb/>
Compliments! why I did not<lb/>
look upon them as such!<lb/>
Cans't thou add aught to<lb/>
the rainbow's hues? But<lb/>
stop! or I will again give<lb/>
occassion for displeasure.<lb/>
Your modesty I truly appre-<lb/>
ciate, and I can imagine in<lb/>
a small degree with what<lb/>
indignation you received my<lb/>
remarks. I have been more<lb/>
than once complimented, but<lb/>
<hi>always by my own relations</hi>-<lb/>
My brother Kit was accus-<lb/>
tomed to speak of me flat-<lb/>
teringly to various young-<lb/>
ladies, and I always retal-<lb/>
iated by persistently refus-<lb/>
ing to become acquainted<lb/>
with these ladies, well-knowing<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01610012"/>
that I should appear as a<lb/>
perfect ignoramus. However,<lb/>
this question, like most others,<lb/>
has two sides and quite dif-<lb/>
ferent ones- If, by compli-<lb/>
menting, you convey a wrong<lb/>
impression of a person's<lb/>
abilities, it is surely doing<lb/>
an injustice; but if you<lb/>
state facts that are plainly<lb/>
visible to anyone, that is<lb/>
quite another matter- The<lb/>
latter part of the foregoing<lb/>
sentence would aptly apply<lb/>
to yourself, while the first<lb/>
part might be justly<lb/>
hurled at the witless head<lb/>
of your unworthy servant.<lb/>
You were right in not at-<lb/>
tributing to me the title of<lb/>
&ldquo;flatterer.&rdquo; No, Miss Emilie,<lb/>
I <del>am</del> do not flatter any<lb/>
one.</p>
<pb n="13" id="f01610013"/>
<p>Flattery is as much to be<lb/>
deprecated as to speak<lb/>
disparagingly of one.<lb/>
I always endeavour<lb/>
to avoid either extreme. I<lb/>
never expect to find perfection<lb/>
in any one's character -- that<lb/>
is impossible -- all have<lb/>
faults -- all, imperfections --<lb/>
Still, in this day of rapid<lb/>
progress, when young ladies<lb/>
(and gentlemen too) are wont<lb/>
to give more attention to<lb/>
outward appearances than<lb/>
to inward culture; when it is<lb/>
so rare to find one who<lb/>
combines culture of <del>the</del> mind<lb/>
with those other, lesser ac-<lb/>
complishments (which though<lb/>
not so important, are yet<lb/>
considered necessary) it is<lb/>
but natural that we should<lb/>
pay our respects and admi-<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f01610014"/>
ration to such sterling worth<lb/>
as oft as we meet with it.<lb/>
Since, however, you desire me<lb/>
to avoid alluding to you in such<lb/>
strains, I must submit, though<lb/>
not cheerfully- You can quiet<lb/>
my pen but not my brain.</p>
<p>So the doctor's happi-<lb/>
ness is complete? I congrat-<lb/>
ulate him <del>wilth</del> <add>with</add> all my heart<lb/>
and wish him all possible<lb/>
joy and success in life. I<lb/>
know of no man who should<lb/>
be more contented. Sur-<lb/>
rounded by loving friends,<lb/>
living in a &ldquo;goodly land,&rdquo;<lb/>
amongst a pleasant people,<lb/>
supplied with a sufficiency<lb/>
of this world's goods, in the<lb/>
beginning of manhood when<lb/>
life is so full of<lb/>
hope, an honored<lb/>
member of the noblest<lb/>
profession on this round<lb/>
<pb n="15" id="f01610015"/>
globe, and, added to all<lb/>
these things, blessed with<lb/>
a sweet, young wife! What<lb/>
more could mortal ask?<lb/>
<del>for?</del> When I look on so<lb/>
bright a picture and then<lb/>
turn my thoughts to the future<lb/>
and consider my bachelor-<lb/>
days, I feel a little out of<lb/>
humor, to say the least-<lb/>
How dark the horizon!<lb/>
not a ray to cheer me on;<lb/>
no hand <del>that</del> extended that<lb/>
I may grasp in mine and<lb/>
feel a new interest in life;<lb/>
no &ldquo;eye to mark my coming<lb/>
and look brighter when I<lb/>
come;&rdquo; no smile to greet me<lb/>
when the day's work is done;<lb/>
no gentle voice to give<lb/>
encouragement amid life's<lb/>
sore trials! Such, such is<lb/>
mine!! &ldquo;So mote it be,&rdquo; since<lb/>
<pb n="16" id="f01610016"/>
thus it must be. There is noth-<lb/>
ing like philosophically accep-<lb/>
ting the inevitable.<lb/>
Others have trod the lonely road,<lb/>
And why not I as well;<lb/>
Others have sunk beneath the load,<lb/>
I'll fall where others fell!<lb/>
If I cannot obtain the<lb/>
prize I seek, this should not<lb/>
cause me to wish my friends<lb/>
the same misfortune- In fact,<lb/>
it is the bachelor's peculiar<lb/>
duty and privelege to look,<lb/>
with an approving eye, on<lb/>
all his married friends, and to<lb/>
wish them long life and hap-<lb/>
piness -- a kind of general<lb/>
adviser, though not &ldquo;master<lb/>
of the situation.&rdquo; There were<lb/>
many other things I had intended<lb/>
speaking<del>s</del> of, but want of space forbids,</p>
<closer>
<salute>I remain,<lb/>
very truly, your friend,</salute>
