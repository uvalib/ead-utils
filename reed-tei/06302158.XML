<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> was<lb/>
full of interest and deserves a<lb/>
longer letter in answer than I<lb/>
am able to write this morning,<lb/>
but I am not going to defer any<lb/>
longer to write. It came on the<lb/>
30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> which happened to be a busy<lb/>
day. I do not have many which<lb/>
deserve to be so called. The next<lb/>
the old pump which ha<del>s</del><add>d</add> served<lb/>
me so faithfully for 81 years and<lb/>
3 days began to cut up and inter-<lb/>
mit &amp; go now fast, now slow &amp; then<lb/>
very weak and I had to go on sick<lb/>
report and take digitalis, and try<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06302159"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
2<lb/>
to take it easy especially as the temp.<lb/>
went to 97&deg;F with humidity ranging<lb/>
between 55 and 84%. July 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> I was<lb/>
much better but the heat was<lb/>
even worse reaching 98&deg;F after a<lb/>
night when the <unclear>weir</unclear> did not get below<lb/>
79&deg;F. Miss Laura Wood came to see<lb/>
me but I was unable to see her.<lb/>
She has gone to the sea shore for the<lb/>
month of July and when Mrs. Kean<lb/>
told her that she tried to tell her<lb/>
of my illness but was unable to<lb/>
get her on the phone, she explained<lb/>
that the phone was in <hi>her husband's<lb/>
name</hi> which was Mr. W. C. Roper.<lb/>
Just why she prefers not to use<lb/>
his name she did not say.<lb/>
She seems to be a very intelligent<lb/>
capable &amp; nice looking young woman<lb/>
straight forward &amp; business like with no fem-<lb/>
inine airs or what the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06302160"/>
3<lb/>
young people of the present day call S. A.<lb/>
If you are good enough to let her have<lb/>
such of your abundant material as you<lb/>
can with convenience to yourself I<lb/>
believe she will make good use<lb/>
of it and return any USS which you<lb/>
may request. Do not however let her<lb/>
have any confidential material<lb/>
such as Reed's letter to Gen. Sternburg<lb/>
about the Pinar del Rio doctors.<lb/>
This I think you had better not<lb/>
print yourself. Some of them are<lb/>
still alive probably and one, Dr. Cooke<lb/>
has redeemed himself &amp; is in the Y. F.<lb/>
Roll of Honor of which you have promised<lb/>
to be a defender. I will give your<lb/>
name and address to Brig. Gen. A.G.<lb/>
Love, Med. Corps. the Surgeon General's<lb/>
Assistant (who will soon retire for<lb/>
age unfortunately). He will arrange<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06302161"/>
to have you notified if any thing<lb/>
comes up in Congress, like the Poucher<lb/>
case. I think you are a wonder to<lb/>
have located the S. G. O. correspondence<lb/>
at Fort Meyer Mr. Brooks can<lb/>
find what you want if any one can<lb/>
but I think it may be like the Irish<lb/>
Sea-cook's Kettle - a story which I will<lb/>
tell you three time if you don't know it.<lb/>
Thanks for the snap shots of Gen. Ireland<lb/>
and me. I showed them to him an<lb/>
hour ago when he was here for a chat.<lb/>
He is very good about coming to see<lb/>
me quite often as for 39 years we have been<lb/>
very close friends. I let him see your<lb/>
letter and he says that Kissinger should<lb/>
go to a Veteran's Bureau Hospital.<lb/>
They have a good one at Indianapolis<lb/>
There would be no charges there for him.</p>
<p>I have just called General Walter Law-<lb/>
rence Reed to ask the news of his Sister<lb/>
Blossom. He says that her attack was<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06302162"/>

WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
functional and of nervous origin and<lb/>
the doctor in charge is quite<lb/>
confident that her heart trouble, which<lb/>
has passed, was not organic in character<lb/>
They are keeping her quiet &amp; in bed<lb/>
but are not worried about her.<lb/>
He says his mother who is now 85<lb/>
is in fine health and spirits.</p>
<p>The photograph of the group at Mariel<lb/>
intriges me greatly. Of course I recog-<lb/>
nize the three that you already know<lb/>
which are by the way excellent likenesses of<lb/>
Dr. Finlay Dr Guiteras &amp; Dr Agramonte. I think<lb/>
the one in the white helmet on the left may be<lb/>
Dr. Lopez del Valle and the two standing behind Drs<lb/>
Finlay &amp; Guiteras dressed in white look very<lb/>
familiar to me, as does the one in black<lb/>
behind Guiteras. But I cannot call<lb/>
their names. Lopez del Valle died only<lb/>
a few months ago as did my good<lb/>
and devoted friend Dr. Jose M. Pe&ntilde;a.<lb/>
I must stop here as lunch is waiting</p>
