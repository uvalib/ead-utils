<salute>Dear Dr Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of Feb 2, received. No hurry about<lb/>
return of photographs I sent, you may keep them as long as necessary,<lb/>
I now realize what you inferred by colleagues, I suppose those<lb/>
who were connected with me at Las Animas and other places,<lb/>
however, will hold that matter until I receive your questions<lb/>
as some details of persons and acts may be necessary. Will<lb/>
then have some idea as to the subjects you propose to cover.</p>
<p>The bibliography of the history of yellow fever is<lb/>
enormous, and it is possible that I may be able to refer<lb/>
you to some that I do not possess, that is along your<lb/>
proposed lines.</p>
<p>Am familiar with the work of Forbes and<lb/>
Lambert whom you mention, and hope you were able to<lb/>
get information.</p>
<p>It is possible I could suggest some data that<lb/>
should be included in your article, but hesitate to<lb/>
do so, because you know what you propose to cover,<lb/>
and I don't, However, will suggest one;-</p>
<p>It would appear to me that Sternberg should<lb/>
have been included in your first article, and still<lb/>
think mention of him should be made in your second.</p>
<p>Sternberg for many years previous to 1900, had<lb/>
been one of the leading American authorities on<lb/>
the subject of yellow fever and had made laborious<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03908012"/>
2<lb/>
2<lb/>
investigations as to its cause, in Havana, Brazil and Mexico.<lb/>
Sternberg was the man who appointed the Reed Commission<lb/>
and gave them orders what they were to do when they were sent<lb/>
to Cuba.</p>
<p>Reed said of Sternberg; quote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The exhaustive reports of<lb/>
<unclear>Chail&eacute;</unclear> in 1880 and by Sternberg in 1890 must always stand<lb/>
as monuments to the earnest spirit of investigation with which<lb/>
<lb/>
the work (causative factors)<add>Taylor</add> was pursued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course we know that his many years of work in<lb/>
the study of yellow fever, failed to discover its cause,<lb/>
but that should not be held against him. Apart from<lb/>
his being the leading <del>bacteri</del> American bacteriologist<lb/>
of his time, he was undoubtedly a yellow fever expert.</p>
<p>I mentioned in a previous letter about photos of Camp<lb/>
Lazear, and suggested two pictures in the article &ldquo;Health<lb/>
Heroes&rdquo; by <unclear>Hallack</unclear> and <unclear>Turner</unclear>, however, I think these<lb/>
were copied from Kelly's book on Reed, because<lb/>
in Kelleys book <hi>are two very good photographs<lb/>
of two buildings in Camp Lazear</hi>. You will be<lb/>
able to get the negatives from the publishers.<lb/>
Hope you have been able to obtain photos<lb/>
of Columbia Barracks as you desire.</p>

<salute>Yours sincerely-</salute>
