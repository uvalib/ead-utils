<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
</opener>
<p>To-day is Sunday. I did<lb/>
not go to church this morning but took<lb/>
a walk instead, I intend to go to<lb/>
the different churches while I am here.</p>
<p>I walked across the Meadows which<lb/>
are within half a block of where we<lb/>
live and through the section of town<lb/>
beyond them. It was a very lovely<lb/>
walk. The houses are all built of<lb/>
stone the style of architecture is varied<lb/>
but the whole effect is harmonious.<lb/>
Yesterday afternoon I walked over<lb/>
to Holyrood Palace but for some<lb/>
reason or other visitors were not<lb/>
admitted, but I will have plenty<lb/>
of time to visit it again.</p>
<p>The town is very hilly some parts<lb/>
are connected with others by long<lb/>
flights of stairs, and bridges connect<lb/>
the high portions. This is only in<lb/>
the old parts of town, the new<lb/>
sections are graded.</p>
<p>I have not yet made a change in<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00131002"/>
my lodgings but I shall do so in<lb/>
a few days. The habit of living in<lb/>
a room to myself is too firmly fixed<lb/>
on me, for me to take kindly to having<lb/>
another person in such close quarters<lb/>
And besides I think I can study<lb/>
much better away from the<lb/>
crowd. I <del>g</del> can get a students<lb/>
lodging easily and live more<lb/>
comfortably and for less money than<lb/>
in the present arrangements.</p>
<p>And then I want to study the manners<lb/>
of the people and I can do that<lb/>
much better alone than when with<lb/>
a party of my own countrymen.</p>
<p>I am sure I can make a great<lb/>
deal out of the course at the University<lb/>
here. I attend three lectures and<lb/>
demonstrations every day and put in<lb/>
the rest of the time in dissection and<lb/>
study.</p>
<p>I hope my cablegram reached you<lb/>
all right. I found that it would<lb/>
cost the same to send it to Uncle<lb/>
Tom as to you so I thought it<lb/>
best to send to you.</p>
<p>It has not been raining yesterday<lb/>
and today but it is cloudy at intervals<lb/>
and always cold.</p>

<p>June 2</p>
<p>I got your very interesting and newsy<lb/>
letter this morning and enjoyed it<lb/>
very much. I did get your letter<lb/>
written on the cars and I thought<lb/>
I had mentioned it. I did not<lb/>
get it until after I had written<lb/>
my first letter and I must have<lb/>
spoken of it in the letter I mailed<lb/>
at Londonderry. I am sorry to<lb/>
hear of Mr. Lazear's illness, the disease<lb/>
seems to have a firm hold on him.</p>
<p>I am glad the trunk keys came all<lb/>
right you must be careful not to<lb/>
mislay the store-house receipt which<lb/>
I sent with them as it might give<lb/>
us some trouble to get them back.</p>
<p>It is raining again today. This is<lb/>
a great place for rain but the<lb/>
people don't seem to mind it. Nearly<lb/>
all the men go about without<lb/>
umbrellas, but as I am not a<lb/>
native I stick to my umbrella.<lb/>
The town is in a very exposed<lb/>
situation and is not protected<lb/>
at all from the wind from the<lb/>
North Sea. The people all look healthy<lb/>
however.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f00131004"/>
<p>Mr. Magill our landlady's husband<lb/>
called on us last night and he<lb/>
was a great entertainment to us.<lb/>
He is a typical Scotchman<lb/>
with quite a broad accent, and<lb/>
very strong orthodox Presbyterian<lb/>
views. He considers that all the<lb/>
trouble in Ireland is due to Popery.<lb/>
In fact he seems to blame all<lb/>
the ills of mankind on Popery.</p>
<p>He said that Glasgow was a terrible<lb/>
place for business and he considered<lb/>
the busy character of that city as<lb/>
something very much against it.<lb/>
He said he had to wait ten minutes<lb/>
on a corner there before he could<lb/>
across without being run over<lb/>
and said that &ldquo;they would'na allow<lb/>
such a thing in Edinburgh&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After talking for some time about the<lb/>
doctrines of the Presbyterian Church, he<lb/>
showed a very intimate knowledge of the<lb/>
virtues of the various kinds of Scotch<lb/>
whiskey.</p>
<p>Give my love to all at Uncle Toms and<lb/>
Mrs. Millers</p>
