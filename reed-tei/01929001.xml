</dateline>
General Francis V. Greene,<lb/>
No. 11, Broadway,<lb/>
New York.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter duly received. It is hardly necessary for me<lb/>
to say that I should have been delighted to have seen you appointed<lb/>
Secretary of War, and during my recent visit to the States, when<lb/>
asked by a very important personage whom I considered to be the<lb/>
most available and best suited man for this position, I mentioned<lb/>
General Francis V. Greene of New York.</p>
<p>In the appointment of Mr Root I am pleased to say that we<lb/>
have a most desirable and excellent secretary, and one in whom we<lb/>
can all place unlimited confidence, and one from whom we shall ob-<lb/>
tain the necessary reforms in the War Department.</p>
<p>Mr Day left a short time ago. I was very glad indeed<lb/>
to see him leave, because the situation was not very favorable here<lb/>
at that time, and it was very probable that he would have contracted<lb/>
the disease, had he remained.</p>
<p>Governor Roosevelt wrote me the other day in reference to<lb/>
his trip to Washington which seems to have been a very pleasant one.</p>
<p>Affairs here are very far from satisfactory as we seem to<lb/>
be drifting on without any definite line of policy so far as the<lb/>
next few years are concerned. However, everyone is doing what he<lb/>
can to further the best interests of our own and the Cuban people.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f01929002"/>
<p>Yellow fever is practically at an end. I have recommended<lb/>
the permanent abandonment of hospitals and barracks in the city and<lb/>
the building of frame structures in the mountains nearby, at an<lb/>
elevation of about twelve to fourteen hundred feet. Here our<lb/>
people will be safe and at the same time near enough to perform any<lb/>
necessary military duty. I hope in the near future to see the gar-<lb/>
rison of regular troops very much diminished and several regiments<lb/>
of native troops formed under American officers who have served in<lb/>
Cuba with distinction.</p>
<p>With kindest regards and many very pleasant recollections of<lb/>
your thoughtfulness and courtesy during my recent visit to the Uni-<lb/>
ted States,</p>
<closer>
<salute>I am very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Leonard Wood</signed>
</closer>
