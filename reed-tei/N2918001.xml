<p>ARE OUR HEROES OF PEACE NEGLECTED?</p>
<p>From the Times-Dispatch of Richmond Va. Nov. 3, 1907</p>
<p>FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>WASHINGTON. D. C., November 2.--<lb/>
Being a martyr does not seem to be<lb/>
such a paying proposition as being a<lb/>
conquerer. Theoretically it ought to<lb/>
be, but the advocates of International<lb/>
peace, and the boards that bestow med-<lb/>
als for heroism and prizes for scientific<lb/>
achievement, haven't been able to<lb/>
bring about that consummation as yet.<lb/>
The death the other day of Dr. James<lb/>
Carroll, last survivor of the little group<lb/>
who down in Cuba in 1900 let them-<lb/>
selves be poisoned, in the interest of<lb/>
science and humanity, by yellow fever<lb/>
<unclear>inden</unclear> mosquitoes has emphasized once<lb/>
more the inadequacy of the honors that<lb/>
are paid by this country to its heroes<lb/>
of peace.</p>
<p>Despite all the nice things that are<lb/>
being said, and the little pensions that<lb/>
are being paid to the widows, nothing<lb/>
has been brought forward to indicate<lb/>
that Dr. Carroll or Dr. Walter Reed or<lb/>
Dr. Jesse W. Lazear are likely in the<lb/>
near future to be voted public monu-<lb/>
ments by Congress for their great vic-<lb/>
tory gained in the warfare humankind<lb/>
is waging against the all but uncon-<lb/>
querable forces of disease and death.<lb/>
The streets of this imperial city are<lb/>
full of military heroes astride of impos-<lb/>
sibly prancing steeds, and of politicians<lb/>
of bygone years standing with their<lb/>
right hands thrust majestically beneath<lb/>
the lapels of metallic frock coats fash-<lb/>
ionable in other ages. Like Berlin,<lb/>
whose celebrated Sieges-Allee, or Hero<lb/>
Row, long since was occupied to over-<lb/>
flowing, so that a new hero annex is<lb/>
in order. Washington also contains<lb/>
more statues than the district commis-<lb/>
sion knows what to do with. Some<lb/>
say that the <unclear>Potomac</unclear> would be a good<lb/>
place for many of them; though others<lb/>
object that Washington has aspirations<lb/>
as a seaport and that it would be a<lb/>
pity to clog the channel.</p>
<p>This is a great country for honoring<lb/>
--rightly enough<unclear>,</unclear> of course--those who<lb/>
have fought, <unclear>bled</unclear> and died pro patria<lb/>
on the field of glory. Amongst the de-<lb/>
parted venerables with military reputa-<lb/>
tions a few folk who cherish the mem-<lb/>
ory of one of the <unclear>noblest</unclear> deeds ever<lb/>
performed by men trust that some day<lb/>
there will be found in Washington a<lb/>
place for an adequate memorial to Dr.<lb/>
Carroll and his associates. The men<lb/>
concerned in the great sacrifice at Ha-<lb/>
vana have now passed on. Dr. Reed<lb/>
is dead: Dr. Lazear died immediately<lb/>
from the disease: Dr. Meyers, of Liv-<lb/>
erpool, a British investigator, lost his<lb/>
life at the time. And now death has<lb/>
removed Dr. Carroll, on whose person<lb/>
was given the first positive demonstra-<lb/>
tion that the mosquito conveys the in-<lb/>
fective agent of yellow fever and who<lb/>
hovered for days between life and<lb/>
death to recover finally and return to<lb/>
Washington, where he succeeded Ma-<lb/>
jor Reed in the chair of bacteriology<lb/>
and pathology in George Washington<lb/>
University.</p>
<p>It is doubtful if the vital importance<lb/>
of the discovery confirmed by these<lb/>
DR. JAMES CARROLL,<lb/>
Last of the Havana Yellow Fever Mar-<lb/>
tyrs.<lb/>
daring investigators has yet been pop-<lb/>
ularly appreciated. It is not simply<lb/>
that a method has been provided for<lb/>
stamping out yellow fever and there-<lb/>
by saving lives of millions who live in<lb/>
tropical conditions; the whole range of<lb/>
possibilities of good health in the<lb/>
tropics has been immensely extended.<lb/>
It has at last become understood that<lb/>
many evils which used to be attributed<lb/>
to pestilential night air, to drinking<lb/>
water, to witchcraft, are in reality due<lb/>
to the buzzing insects that swarm in a<lb/>
humid and superheated clime. On ac-<lb/>
count of the fear of diseases, for ex-<lb/>
ample, and particularly of yellow fe-<lb/>
ver, most people in tropical America<lb/>
still sleep with their windows closed.<lb/>
For that reason tuberculosis ravages<lb/>
Spanish-American countries to an in-<lb/>
credible and entirely unnecessary <unclear>ex-<lb/>
tent.</unclear> Now that it has been ascertained<lb/>
there is no spirit of destruction in the<lb/>
evening breeze screens can be arranged<lb/>
to keep<unclear>,</unclear> out the mosquitoes; the fresh<lb/>
air does all the rest.</p>
<p>The <unclear>foregoing</unclear> is, of course, only one<lb/>
of the beneficent results of the work<lb/>
of the early autumn of 1900 when Drs.<lb/>
Carroll and Lazear agreed to lead the<lb/>
forlorn hope in a contest then being<lb/>
waged against one of the most malig-<lb/>
nant of diseases. A paper on yellow<lb/>
fever investigations by Dr. A. H. Don-<lb/>
ally, instructor in bacteriology and<lb/>
pathology at George Washington Uni-<lb/>
versity, has just been published in this<lb/>
autumn's bulletin devoted to the work<lb/>
of the department of medicine. <unclear>The<lb/>
ile in detail.</unclear> The story of the <unclear>every</unclear><lb/>
beginning August <unclear>17, 1909</unclear>, when Dr.<lb/>
Carroll <unclear>baed his af</unclear> in the laboratory<lb/>
and <unclear>allowed</unclear> a fellow physician to apply<lb/>
to <unclear>it</unclear> a mosquito which had twelve days<lb/>
before <unclear>bitten</unclear> a severe case of yellow<lb/>
fever on the second day of the disease<lb/>
and had thereafter bitten three other<lb/>
cases at intervals of six, eight and ten<lb/>
days. On September 2d it was clear<lb/>
that Dr. Carroll had yellow fever,<lb/>
which raged in his system for the al-<lb/>
lotted period.</p>
<p>The nobility of the sacrifice made by<lb/>
these physicians is strongly set forth<lb/>
by Dr. Donally in his discussion. One<lb/>
of the finest tributes ever paid their<lb/>
work was that of Dr. Henry D. <unclear>Hol-<lb/>
ton</unclear>, in his address as president of the<lb/>
American Public Health Association,<lb/>
in 1902, when he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The patriotism of the military as<lb/>
they spring to the defense of their<lb/>
country, always deserves and receives<lb/>
the applause of the populace. Their<lb/>
deadly conflict on the battlefield is<lb/>
made easy by martial music, the boom-<lb/>
ing of artillery, the rattle of the in-<lb/>
fantry fire and the advancing step of<lb/>
comrades. How much more should we<lb/>
recognize the course of such devotees<lb/>
of science as Drs. James Carroll and<lb/>
Jesse W. Lazear, who, filled with a<lb/>
great philanthropic love for humanity,<lb/>
calmly, quietly, without the cheers or<lb/>
even the knowledge of the <unclear>mulitude</unclear>,<lb/>
silently submitted themselves to the<lb/>
test to determine in what way this pes-<lb/>
tilence was communicated. We are<lb/>
told, &lsquo;Greater love hath no man than<lb/>
this that a man lay down his life for<lb/>
his friend.&rsquo; We find that Jesse W. La-<lb/>
zear, fired and impelled by his great<lb/>
love for his fellow man, did offer his<lb/>
body as a sacrifice upon the altar of<lb/>
scientific investigation, to the end that<lb/>
in the years to come hundreds of thou-<lb/>
sands might escape this pestilential<lb/>
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll's untimely death, at the<lb/>
age of fifty-three, concluded a very<lb/>
honorable career beginning with ele-<lb/>
mentary education at a school in Wool-<lb/>
wich, England--he was an Englishman<lb/>
by birth--which was followed by train-<lb/>
ing in the University of Maryland and<lb/>
in the post graduate pathological de-<lb/>
partment of Johns Hopkins University.<lb/>
After his fateful experiment at Havana<lb/>
he was made first lieutenant and as-<lb/>
sistant surgeon in the United States<lb/>
Army, and professor of bacteriology<lb/>
and clinical miscroscopy in the army<lb/>
medical school <unclear>besides</unclear> holding a pro-<lb/>
fessorship in the department of medi-<lb/>
cine of the George Washington Uni-<lb/>
versity, where he was universally be-<lb/>
loved. The general public which ne-<lb/>
cessarily has not been particularly in-<lb/>
terested in such technical matters as<lb/>
the directory that the &ldquo;<unclear>Myxococeldium<lb/>
Stegomyiae</unclear>&rdquo; had nothing to do direct-<lb/>
ly with yellow fever was at the same<lb/>
time <unclear>aroused</unclear> by his <unclear>discease</unclear> to a<lb/>
somewhat better understanding of the<lb/>
man's simple-minded heroism.</p>
