<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am now in the freight<lb/>
office at Amsterdam waiting to go<lb/>
through some miserable formality about<lb/>
the stuff I sent down from Heidelberg.<lb/>
We arrived here last night by<lb/>
rail from Cologne and this morning<lb/>
I went at once to the bank where<lb/>
I received two letters from you<lb/>
which I enjoyed very much. I am<lb/>
afraid another will come tonight<lb/>
or to-morrow and that I will<lb/>
miss it. I will go to the bank<lb/>
again today. Did I forget to tell<lb/>
you about the trip over the<lb/>
channel? Well, there was not<lb/>
a motion of the boat. The channel<lb/>
was like a river.</p>
<p>I am delighted to hear that you<lb/>
have won the second round<lb/>
in the wild case. It must come<lb/>
all right in the end.</p>
<p>Our walk since I last wrote<lb/>
has been uneventful. The scenery<lb/>
all the time was very fine.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00160002"/>
We stayed a night at<lb/>
St. Goarshousen near the<lb/>
Lorlei where I think I<lb/>
wrote to you. The next night<lb/>
we stayed at Eugers. (Come<lb/>
to think of it, it was at<lb/>
Eugers that I wrote to you.)<lb/>
The next night was at<lb/>
Konigswinter making<lb/>
a walk of over a hundred<lb/>
miles in three days.</p>
<p>We walked up to Bonn<lb/>
on Wednesday morning<lb/>
<del>I</del> looked over that town<lb/>
and then rode to Cologne<lb/>
<del>From</del> We stayed at Cologne<lb/>
until yesterday afternoon<lb/>
and then came on here.<lb/>
Cologne is a very interesting<lb/>
place. The cathedral is<lb/>
grand.</p>
<p>Amsterdam is a very<lb/>
curious place. Full<lb/>
of canals and bridges.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00160003"/>
The language is very odd.<lb/>
it is somewhat like the<lb/>
German but it has a<lb/>
decided resemblance<lb/>
to the English. It is<lb/>
sometimes really laughable.</p>
<p><hi>Later in the day</hi>.</p>
<p>We have now attended<lb/>
to all our luggage, and<lb/>
nothing remains now but<lb/>
to go on board. The vessel<lb/>
sails at 8 tomorrow<lb/>
morning, so we will go<lb/>
on board tonight.</p>
<p>She is a very decent looking<lb/>
boat about the size of<lb/>
the &ldquo;Ethiopia.&rdquo; When I reach<lb/>
New York I will go<lb/>
right to Mrs. Denison's, and<lb/>
I will telegraph to<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00160004"/>
you as soon as we<lb/>
arrive. We will not<lb/>
reach New York before the<lb/>
20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. You can write<lb/>
to me c/o Mrs. Denison and<lb/>
please say if you are<lb/>
going to Baltimore to<lb/>
look over the boxes. I will<lb/>
go then if you will,<lb/>
or I will go there by<lb/>
myself and attend to<lb/>
them if you would<lb/>
rather not go. When<lb/>
I reach New York I<lb/>
will look up the<lb/>
boarding-houses, the addresses<lb/>
of which you gave me.</p>
<p>Now that my trip is over<lb/>
and I look back on it<lb/>
all, I can see that I<lb/>
have gained considerable<lb/>
information, I also have<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00160005"/>
cause for regret at not<lb/>
seeing more of some of<lb/>
the places, but as it is<lb/>
the labor was very<lb/>
great and I am glad<lb/>
of the two weeks rest<lb/>
that I must have on the<lb/>
steamer. A trip such<lb/>
as I have taken is very<lb/>
instructive but there is<lb/>
very little pleasure in it.<lb/>
Throughout the whole<lb/>
thing my idea was to<lb/>
learn not to enjoy.</p>
<p>I am very glad to think<lb/>
that I have not long to<lb/>
wait before seeing you.</p>
<p>Give my love to all,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your affectionate Son</salute>
