<salute>My Sweet little E.,</salute>

<p>With truth, I<lb/>
might exclaim &ldquo;snow, snow,<lb/>
nothing but snow&rdquo;! For we<lb/>
have had plenty of it. Friday mor-<lb/>
ning, I awoke to find the earth<lb/>
mantled in white, pure white,<lb/>
such as dazzles &amp; blinds the<lb/>
eye. 'Twas the first heavy snow<lb/>
that we have had, this winter, and<lb/>
hence we were proud of it.<lb/>
Of course, the only topic of our<lb/>
conversation was <hi>sleighing</hi>-<lb/>
to which we looked forward<lb/>
with much pleasant antici-<lb/>
pation; and I am happy to say<lb/>
that we were not disappointed.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01707002"/>
The day was all that one could<lb/>
wish - bright &amp; beautiful, though<lb/>
very cold. I did not go sleighing<lb/>
during the day but at 7.30 P.M.<lb/>
Lieutenant Young called by for<lb/>
me in his &ldquo;nobby&rdquo; little Cutter,<lb/>
to which was hitched an ani-<lb/>
mal that can make a mile in<lb/>
less than three minutes. Seat-<lb/>
ing myself by his side &amp; draw-<lb/>
ing the heavy robes closely about<lb/>
us, we were soon speeding<lb/>
with the wind- Oh! it was char-<lb/>
ming! The jingling music of<lb/>
the sleigh-bells, the crisp, cold<lb/>
air, the flying snow, the silver<lb/>
moon over head, all combined<lb/>
to make a most beautiful win-<lb/>
ter-scene<del>s</del>, &amp; one that I shall<lb/>
long remember- But withal;<lb/>
my darling Emilie, it lacked<lb/>
the <hi>charm</hi> of <hi>your</hi> presence!<lb/>
without which no scene<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01707003"/>
of my life can be complete.<lb/>
I am not done telling you of<lb/>
the grand times we had sleighing.<lb/>
Saturday Morning, Lieut. Symons<lb/>
&amp; I procured a team &amp; sleigh,<lb/>
(the latter large enough to seat<lb/>
nine)- for the purpose of giving<lb/>
the ladies of the Post the benefit<lb/>
of <add>a</add> trip over the snow- We left<lb/>
the Post with six ladies &amp; one<lb/>
gentleman, besides ourselves,<lb/>
&amp; a merrier party never were<lb/>
brought together- There were<lb/>
Mrs. King, Mrs. Heger, Mrs. Tabor,<lb/>
Mrs. Abbott, Mrs. Oxholm &amp; Miss<lb/>
Abbott- Of course, it was im-<lb/>
possible for such a jolly crowd<lb/>
to return without some ac-<lb/>
cident- We had gone about<lb/>
6 miles &amp; were having &ldquo;no thought<lb/>
for the morrow,&rdquo; when sud-<lb/>
denly one of the runners<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01707004"/>
of our sleigh broke, &amp; down we<lb/>
came, all in a <hi>bunch</hi>! We did<lb/>
not care for this, &amp; instead of in-<lb/>
terrupting the jollity of our ride,<lb/>
it only served to increase it.<lb/>
We were in the town of Flushing<lb/>
when the accident occurred, so<lb/>
we were enabled to quickly pro-<lb/>
cure other sleighs- Two others<lb/>
were soon found &amp; dividing<lb/>
our party, Mrs. King, Mrs. Tabor, &amp;<lb/>
myself, in one sleigh, &amp; the remain-<lb/>
der in another, we were soon<lb/>
on our way home, as merry<lb/>
as ever,-where we arrived safely-<lb/>
This, my darling, is an incident<lb/>
of Army life. I am happy to hear<lb/>
that you have such an addition<lb/>
to the intelligence of M'boro. Since<lb/>
his name is not <hi>Reed</hi>, I expect<lb/>
that you will greatly admire him-<lb/>
Excuse brevity-</p>
<closer>
<salute>As ever, my darling,<lb/>
your fond &amp; devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
<seg>
P.S. Kindest regards<lb/>
to Miss A. &amp; Mrs.<lb/>
Harrold-<lb/>
W.<lb/>
