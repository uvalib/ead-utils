</head>
<p>Kean apologizes for a delay in returning to Hench a box of materials and an annotated list. He comments on information that was provided to Hench by Angles and on Hemmeter's article on Carroll. He gives information about where Lazear was buried in Cuba, and about the later transfer of his remains to the United States.</p>

<salute>My dear Dr Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am much ashamed of<lb/>
my long silence. I went away<lb/>
for Christmas week and on the<lb/>
day after New Year Day I came<lb/>
down with influenza. <del>I</del> was not<lb/>
a very severe attack, but it held<lb/>
on a long time, with weak legs<lb/>
and a dull brain and I put<lb/>
off every thing that I could-<lb/>
for some days I have felt all<lb/>
right again, but have only been out<lb/>
of the house Twice - to funerals, of an<lb/>
old friend and his wife, who died<lb/>
during the same week. Now I am<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06301048"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
2<lb/>
working off the accumulative of<lb/>
&ldquo;must do&rdquo; 's and have taken up<lb/>
your box to return it with the<lb/>
mimeograph (marked as you wished)<lb/>
and the extracts which I made<lb/>
from Vol. 5 of my diary. Vol. 5<lb/>
is a Thicker Volume than the others<lb/>
and has a lot of things stuck into<lb/>
it, but as you see very little of the<lb/>
yellow fever episode. Your letter<lb/>
of Dec. 30 has been stuck up against<lb/>
the inkstand on my desk ever since<lb/>
its arrival on Jan. 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> to remind<lb/>
me to answer it. &amp; this is the belated<lb/>
answer to it, <hi>inter alia</hi> - And<lb/>
here and now, lest I forget it, I must<lb/>
give you my compliments on the<lb/>
beautifully gotten up printed and<lb/>
illustrated. &ldquo;Mile Post-&rdquo; which came<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06301049"/>
3<lb/>
some little time ago. Whether it was<lb/>
mailed by you or from the college<lb/>
I am not now certain, by I think<lb/>
it came in your envelope.<lb/>
I am especially glad to have your<lb/>
address and that of Dr Sawyer<lb/>
in such excellent type to add to<lb/>
my collection of Walter Reed and<lb/>
Yellow Fever U.S.S. I hope you sent<lb/>
a copy to Mr. Clemons, the Librarian<lb/>
at the Univ of Va. who has a W. Reed &amp;<lb/>
Y. F. file. I would advise that you write<lb/>
prominently on the outside &ldquo;See addresses&rdquo;<lb/>
Dr. W. A. Sawyer and Dr. P. S. Hench, which<lb/>
would guide the <hi>Mile Post</hi> into that file.<lb/>
It would be well too to send a note to<lb/>
Mr. Clemons explaining why you sent it<lb/>
you cannot refer to the pages, as the Mile<lb/>
Post has no page numbers.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f06301050"/>
<p>4</p>
<p>I stopped at the bottom of the foregoing<lb/>
page because I was called to lunch &amp;,<lb/>
when I came back to my little study,<lb/>
there on the desk was a fat envelope<lb/>
from you. I am glad that I had made<lb/>
a good start on the box and this letter<lb/>
before it came for I am saved an ad-<lb/>
ditional pang of remorse, if it had come<lb/>
before I started in on the return of the box.<lb/>
I sat down at once and read your letter<lb/>
with its questionnaire and Dr. Angles's<lb/>
letter. How queerly he has got things<lb/>
mixed up and he is so perfectly sure<lb/>
about it. He is perfectly honest and it<lb/>
shows how very fallible the human mem-<lb/>
ory is after 40 years! I will write to him<lb/>
but I am afraid he will think. &ldquo;Poor old<lb/>
Commandante Kean! he is certainly in his<lb/>
dotage&rdquo;. Now that this letter will give me<lb/>
some more papers to put into the box<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06301051"/>
5<lb/>
I think I will not send it off tonight<lb/>
as I had in mind, but will keep<lb/>
it a while longer. I will however send<lb/>
This off as an evidence of good faith<lb/>
and good intentions.</p>
<p>I am more and more impressed with<lb/>
your zeal and acumen in going to the<lb/>
bottom of things. <hi>You are a born researcher</hi>.<lb/>
I may have to employ a stenographer<lb/>
after all to satisfy your thirst for<lb/>
meticulous information. I hate to<lb/>
charge it to you and as, with the<lb/>
support of a widowed daughter &amp; her child-<lb/>
dren on my hands, my pay check is<lb/>
all gone by the end of each month. I<lb/>
cannot offer to pay the typist myself.<lb/>
But I will look over the 30 questions<lb/>
and see - many of them can be answer-<lb/>
ed very easily and briefly. But when<lb/>
you bring Hemmeter and Carroll into<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06301052"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
6<lb/>
it that is another story and one<lb/>
of which I knew, at first hand,<lb/>
very little. Carroll was very care-<lb/>
ful not to say in my presence any<lb/>
of the intermations which I heard<lb/>
he was dropping that the credit<lb/>
belonged more to him than to Reed<lb/>
but that the Medical Corps did not<lb/>
want it to go to a Contract Doctor,<lb/>
who was not a commissioned officer<lb/>
and who had been an enlisted man.<lb/>
I have never seen Hemmeter's article<lb/>
in James. Carroll &amp; <del>Jam</del> Hemmeter<lb/>
were class-mates, I have heard, at the<lb/>
Maryland Medical School, (I am not<lb/>
sure of its title), where Carroll got his<lb/>
degree in medicine, and Hemmeter fell<lb/>
for this disloyal and egotistic talk.<lb/>
<hi>To be continued in our next</hi></p>
<p>I think you may be very sure that Gen. Truby will not object<lb/>
to your sending me a copy of your letter to him.</p>

I note in your letter to Gen Truby<lb/>
of Jan 7 1941 you ask about<lb/>
the cemetary where Lazear &amp; the<lb/>
others who died at Columbia<lb/>
Bks were buried. It was a<lb/>
poor little temporary place near<lb/>
the La Playa road <del>he</del> the south<lb/>
west corner of the reservation.<lb/>
Lazear's body with the others were<lb/>
taken up, put into new coffins and<lb/>
taken to the United States. It was<lb/>
I think in the autumn of 1900 as<lb/>
I remember Reed was present<lb/>
when Lazear's body was exhumed.<lb/>
