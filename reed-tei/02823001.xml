FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Kelly:</salute>
</opener>
<p>your kind and pleasant letter reaches me when I am in<lb/>
trouble; and I shall have no time to write you as I would have liked<lb/>
to do. Our good work of more than four years has suddenly broken down.<lb/>
An epidemic of dengue we have had through the Summer evidently prevent-<lb/>
ed us from recognising some mild case of yellow fever, and we have now<lb/>
a secondary crop of cases. I believe we shall stop it before it becomes<lb/>
epidemic. You try and help us to get fair play. Moneyed interests in<lb/>
your country are at work constantly against us. Senator Cullom a few<lb/>
days ago presented to the President information to the effect that we<lb/>
were neglecting sanitation, and that we were threatened with an epid-<lb/>
emic. Of so many prophets of evil as we have heard of at the rate of<lb/>
three or four a year, at last Mr. Cullom did hit it. But these men are<lb/>
doing your Southern section serious injury. They are specially interest<lb/>
ed in sewarage and paving jobs, and they talk of our neglect in these<lb/>
matters as the threatening cause of our coming outbreak. With this the<lb/>
teaching of the mosquito doctrine in the South is being neglected. <del>He</del><lb/>
Hence the reason why your Sothern country has had the fever twice to<lb/>
our once. The Herald and the informers of Senator Cullom will not let<lb/>
the South know that if we have yellow fever today it is simply because<lb/>
a case has slipped in upon us unawares; and if we stop the disease to-<lb/>
morrow it will be because we have killed all the mosquitos that have<lb/>
become infected.</p>
<p>It is sad to contemplate that the country of Reed has been among<lb/>
the last to profit from his work. He was a grat and a lovable man.<lb/>
I remember well the days when he was keeping his secret from us. It<lb/>
was not the air of mistery of the conceited man who is glorying in his<lb/>
superiority, nor that of the sordid man who is thinking of the profit<lb/>

FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY<lb/>
he is to obtain from his secret. No, the merry twinkle in his blue eye<lb/>
was expressive of the anticipated enjoyment of the pleasure that he<lb/>
had in store for us all. To me one of the sweetest traits in his charac<lb/>
ter was the respect, the esteem, the love he felt for the great master,<lb/>
Finlay. There <add>was</add> something of the filial attitude in his brief intercourse<lb/>
with Finlay. He had taken up, and brought to a glourious completeness<lb/>
the work of the great thinker.</p>
<p>Thank you for the kind remembrance of the days of Blockley.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours</salute>
