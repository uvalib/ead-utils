<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was glad to get your two<lb/>
letters and I am just as well pleased<lb/>
that the boxes did not come as I<lb/>
find that many of the things would be<lb/>
of no use to us here I am going to<lb/>
ask you to have the boxes opened and<lb/>
some of the things sent to the storage<lb/>
warehouse. Rather an imposition on you<lb/>
but it would be a great favor. The small<lb/>
box need not be opened. It contains only<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00312002"/>
scientific apparatus, a list of which I<lb/>
shall enclose. I shall also enclose<lb/>
a list of things in the other boxes which<lb/>
we shall need and another list of<lb/>
things to be sent to the warehouse<lb/>
If I have forgotten anything use your<lb/>
own judgment about sending and if<lb/>
in doubt send it. I think the square<lb/>
box would do for the things to be<lb/>
sent but if not you could get a<lb/>
strong box somewhere in the neighborhood.<lb/>
Please send the two boxes by the Southern<lb/>
Express instead of by freight. I find that<lb/>
the difference in cost is not great and<lb/>

that by freight it would take at least<lb/>
a month to reach here. Please<lb/>
get Snyder to mark the address<lb/>
slowly on the boxes.</p>
<p>We are at last settled in our quarter<lb/>
we have two frame houses of one room<lb/>
each connected by a short bridge.<lb/>
One of the rooms is very large and<lb/>
we are going to curtain one and off as<lb/>
a bed-room for Mabel and me and<lb/>
use the rest as a <unclear>sitting</unclear> room. The<lb/>
other room is for the baby and Gertrude.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00312004"/>
The houses are of plain pine boards<lb/>
without any trimming. There are no<lb/>
glass windows, only shutters but we<lb/>
would have no use for windows.<lb/>
We are on high ground and there is<lb/>
a breeze blowing constantly. The medical<lb/>
staff is all close together and we<lb/>
shall mess with them. There is one<lb/>
other lady the wife of the post-surgeon<lb/>
The baby is getting along nicely. Milk is<lb/>
impossible to get but we have condensed<lb/>
milk and we are giving him eggs and<lb/>
oat meal and meat juice which<lb/>
he takes to very kindly. They have all<lb/>

been very kind here. We have the use<lb/>
of four hospital beds and they have<lb/>
would as mosquito nets until our<lb/>
arrive. We bought three chairs and<lb/>
a few pans and things. It is lucky<lb/>
we did not have to buy much as<lb/>
everything is frightfully dear. Most<lb/>
things are about ten times as much<lb/>
as at home.</p>
<p>I am delighted to find the laboratory very<lb/>
well equipped and they are ready to get<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00312006"/>
whatever I may need.</p>
<p>It has been very warm until today but<lb/>
now it is very pleasant and cool.</p>
<p>I wish I had a Kodak to give<lb/>
you some views of our surroundings<lb/>
but I shall try to get a photographer<lb/>
to come out and take some<lb/>
pictures.</p>
