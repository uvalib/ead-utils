<p>FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Yellow Fever</hi></p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>YELLOW FEVER is<lb/>
one of the most deadly<lb/>
diseases to which human<lb/>
beings are subject. It is<lb/>
peculiar to the American<lb/>
continent and tropical<lb/>
America was its great<lb/>
stronghold. It existed<lb/>
perpetually in Havana and from there it<lb/>
frequently invaded the United States,<lb/>
sometimes as far north as Boston. In<lb/>
1878, only 45 years ago, there was an<lb/>
epidemic of yellow fever in the southern<lb/>
cities which resulted in 16,000 deaths<lb/>
and an economic loss estimated at<lb/>
$100,000,000.</p>
<p>At the close of the Spanish-American<lb/>
War in 1898, Havana came into our pos-<lb/>
session, and when in the following year<lb/>
yellow fever broke out among the Amer-<lb/>
ican soldiers there a commission was<lb/>
appointed to look into its cause and<lb/>
transmission. The commission was com-<lb/>
posed of Major Walter Reed, Dr. James<lb/>
Carroll, Dr. J. W. Lazear and Aristides<lb/>
Agramonte.</p>
<p>Major Reed decided first of all to in-<lb/>
vestigate a theory advanced by Dr.<lb/>
Carlos H. Finley twenty years before<lb/>
that the disease was transmitted by mos-<lb/>
quitoes. The only way of proving or dis-<lb/>
proving this theory was by animal ex-<lb/>
perimentation. At that time the lower<lb/>
animals were thought to be immune to</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03142008"/>
<p>yellow fever, so if the experiments were<lb/>
to be tried at all, it must be on human<lb/>
beings.  Volunteers were called for and<lb/>
the Commissioners insisted that they<lb/>
themselves should be included.  Every<lb/>
man knew that he was likely to die, but<lb/>
he also knew that in so doing he might<lb/>
save thousands of his fellow men from<lb/>
death.  The volunteers permitted them-<lb/>
selves to be bitten by mosquitoes which<lb/>
had previously bitten yellow fever pa-<lb/>
tients.  Lazear was one of the first and <lb/>
he soon became ill with yellow fever<lb/>
and died in convulsions.  Carroll almost<lb/> 
died; for three days his life hung in the<lb/>
balance.  The experiment was continued <lb/>
on eleven other men, and as nine of <lb/>
them contracted yellow fever, Reed felt<lb/>
justified in saying that the disease was<lb/>
carried by mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Still there were many men who were<lb/>
not convinced, and Reed and his asso-<lb/>
ciates decided to repeat the experiments<lb/>
under conditions which would leave no<lb/>
doubt that the results were conclusive.<lb/>
In a lonely place, a mile from the nearest<lb/>
habitations, they established an experi-<lb/>
mental station, and placed an armed <lb/>
guard around it.  It was named Camp<lb/>
Lazear.  An immune hospital steward<lb/>
brought supplies from Camp Columbia,<lb/>
but no other intercourse with the town<lb/>
was permitted.  A small frame building<lb/>
was put up, and screened to prevent<lb/>
mosquitoes from getting in or out.  The<lb/>
interior was divided into two apartments,<lb/>
separated by wire mosquito netting.<lb/>
Two susceptible men were put into this<lb/>
building, one in each compartment, and <lb/>
there they remained for several days,<lb/>
subjected in every way to the same con-</p>
<pb n="3" id="f03142009"/>
<p>ditions.  When they had lived there<lb/>
in good health long enough to prove that<lb/>
there could be no infection, Reed put<lb/>
fifteen infected mosquitoes into one of<lb/>
the compartments, and presently de-<lb/>
clared that compartment to be infected.<lb/>
When the man in the infected compart-<lb/>
ment had been bitten by mosquitoes,<lb/>
Reed took him out, but returned him for<lb/>
a short time later in the day and again<lb/>
on the following day, until altogether<lb/>
he had been bitten fifteen times.  Mean-<lb/>
while two men were left in the com-<lb/>
partment which contained no mosqui-<lb/>
toes.  These men remained perfectly<lb/>
well, but in four days the man who had<lb/>
been bitten went down with yellow fever.</p>
<p>Reed, after simply removing the fif-<lb/>
teen mosquitoes declared the infected<lb/>
compartment disinfected.  A non-im-<lb/>
mune soldier was then placed in each<lb/>
compartment and the two remained per-<lb/>
fectly well for several days.</p>
<p>Even the skeptics now admitted that <lb/>
yellow fever could be transmitted by <lb/>
mosquitoes, but they still maintained<lb/>
that this was not the only means of<lb/>
transmission.  The volunteers then sub-<lb/>
mitted to a further series of most un-<lb/>
pleasant experiments, and finally proved <lb/>
conclusively that yellow fever is not<lb/>
contagious and that it is transmitted<lb/>
only by mosquitoes.</p>
<p>There followed a vigorous war upon <lb/>
mosquitoes.  They were killed by whole-<lb/>
sale by fumigation and their breeding <lb/>
places were sought out and destroyed.<lb/>
In seven months Havana was free from<lb/>
yellow fever for the first time in 140<lb/>
years.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f03142010"/>
<p>A few years later, General William C.<lb/>
Gorgas started a similar campaign in the<lb/>
Panama Canal Zone and within twelve<lb/>
months abolished yellow fever there<lb/>
and made possible the building of the<lb/>
Panama Canal. This deadly disease with<lb/>
a few others had cost the French 22,189<lb/>
human lives--one of the chief reasons<lb/>
why the French abandoned the canal<lb/>
project.</p>
<p>Who will say that Reed and Lazear<lb/>
and their brave associates paid too high<lb/>
a price for this enormous saving of life?<lb/>
Who will say that they should not have<lb/>
risked their lives to save millions from<lb/>
suffering and death? Have not right<lb/>
minded people always honored those<lb/>
who have given their lives for others?<lb/>
If we honor the soldier who dies to save<lb/>
his company--a wounded comrade per-<lb/>
haps--how shall we honor Lazear, who<lb/>
died to save a hundred thousand men?<lb/>
There is a modest tablet to his memory<lb/>
in Johns Hopkins University, and a<lb/>
great hospital in Washington bears the<lb/>
name of Walter Reed. But the service<lb/>
they rendered to humanity is beyond<lb/>
estimate and beyond reward. And if the<lb/>
bodies of men like this are not too sacred<lb/>
to dedicate to such work as they per-<lb/>
formed, is it too much to ask that the<lb/>
bodies of a few rats or rabbits or guinea<lb/>
pigs shall be dedicated to work of equal<lb/>
importance? The American Association<lb/>
for Medical Progress submits that it is<lb/>
not.</p>
