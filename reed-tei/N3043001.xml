<p>Gorgas Recalls Death<lb/>
Of Famous Mosquito</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Hospital Staff Failed to Save<lb/>
Havana Health Depart-<lb/>
ment's Pet</p>
<p>(<unclear>The incident related</unclear> by Major Gen-<lb/>
eral W. C. Gorgas, says &ldquo;The Times of<lb/>
Cuba,&rdquo; occurred in Havana in Febru-<lb/>
ary, 1901, during the scientific experi-<lb/>
mentation with yellow fever infection<lb/>
through the bite of the mosquito.<lb/>
Through the work of the American sur-<lb/>
geon and scientist in combination with<lb/>
eminent Cubans, yellow fever was<lb/>
driven out of Cuba, probably forever,<lb/>
as there has not been a single case in<lb/>
the country for many years.)</p>
<p>At this time (February, 1901) we had<lb/>
only one infected mosquito left, which<lb/>
had been given us by Dr. Reed. The<lb/>
old lady was a veteran in every sense.<lb/>
She had given several persons yellow<lb/>
fever, but her greatest claim to celeb-<lb/>
rity was the fact that it had been fifty-<lb/>
seven days before the first case of<lb/>
fever and the last which she had given.</p>
<p>The weather is cool in Havana dur-<lb/>
ing January, February and March, so<lb/>
that the stepomyia under ordinary con-<lb/>
ditions become quite sluggish in their<lb/>
movements and a great many die.<lb/>
Mosquitoes decreased so much during<lb/>
these months that yellow fever became<lb/>
more or less rare, and it was very diffi-<lb/>
cult for us to infect our mosquitoes.<lb/>
While for 140 years there had never<lb/>
been a single month in which there had<lb/>
not been some reported case of yellow<lb/>
fever in Havana, still a very small pro-<lb/>
portion of these cases was recognized<lb/>
during the first three days, and it must<lb/>
be remembered that a mosquito has to<lb/>
bite within that period of the disease<lb/>
in man to become infected. We were,<lb/>
therefore, keeping our only infected<lb/>
mosquito with a great deal of care and<lb/>
tenderness, knowing that we had to de-<lb/>
pend upon her to start out <unclear>vaccination</unclear><lb/>
work.</p>
<p>In all Havana there was probably<lb/>
not a single fireplace or other means<lb/>
of artificial heat, so we sent to the<lb/>
United States and imported an oil<lb/>
stove wherewith to keep her ladyship's<lb/>
room always at summer temperature.<lb/>
Her home was a large glass jar on a<lb/>
table in the centre of a sunshiny room.<lb/>
In this jar was hung a lump of white<lb/>
sugar on which she fed when hungry,<lb/>
and to this was added, now and then,<lb/>
a small piece of banana. A small ves-<lb/>
sel containing water was also kept in<lb/>
the jar. In order that she might have<lb/>
a plentiful supply of fresh air the<lb/>
glass top was not placed upon the jar,<lb/>
but a sleeve of mosquito netting was<lb/>
tied over its top.</p>
<p>There are some 700 different species<lb/>
of mosquitoes, in all of which the<lb/>
natural food is the various vegetable<lb/>
juices. In all species the female has<lb/>
to have a feed of blood before she<lb/>
can lay eggs. Blood does not seem to<lb/>
be necessary for life, but simply<lb/>
stimulates the function of ovulation.<lb/>
In order that the female may get this<lb/>
blood she is furnished with biting ap-<lb/>
paratus not possessed by the male. The<lb/>
male never bites, not being physically<lb/>
able to do so. The female stegomyia,<lb/>
therefore, is alone concerned in the<lb/>
transmission of yellow fever.</p>
<p>Las Animas Hospital, being the<lb/>
yellow fever hospital for the city of<lb/>
Havana, was a centre of attraction for<lb/>
most of the doctors of the Health De-<lb/>
partment. Dr. John W. Ross, Dr.<lb/>
Juan Guiteras and myself were at this<lb/>
hospital almost every day. Dr. Guit-<lb/>
eras had charge of the vaccination<lb/>
work and of the laboratory where the<lb/>
mosquitoes for this work were being<lb/>
bred. Our lady mosquito was, there-<lb/>
fore, directly under his care. She had<lb/>
given so many people yellow fever<lb/>
and was, therefore, so valuable for our<lb/>
prospective work, that we all, when at<lb/>
the hospital, would drop in to see how<lb/>
she was getting on and to pay our<lb/>
respects.</p>
<p>One morning about daylight I got a<lb/>
message stating that her ladyship was<lb/>
in a most critical and desperate plight,<lb/>
as some time during the night she had<lb/>
got her wing caught in a mesh of the<lb/>
mosquito netting and had struggled to<lb/>
free herself for so long a time that<lb/>
when she was discovered by the attend-<lb/>
ant<unclear>"</unclear> in the morning she was almost<lb/>
dead. I rapidly dressed and hurried to<lb/>
the hospital. Similar messages had<lb/>
been sent to Dr. Ross and Dr. Guiteras.<lb/>
<unclear>We found her condition even worse</unclear><lb/>
than had been represented. Two or<lb/>
three of the doctors on the staff of the<lb/>
hospital had been promptly called in<lb/>
and the services of several of our<lb/>
trained nurses had been likewise ob-<lb/>
tained. Her wing had been gently lib-<lb/>
erated from the mesh of the netting<lb/>
and her ladyship laid upon a soft bed<lb/>
of cotton batting.</p>
<p>The oil stove was started up and the<lb/>
room brought to a very hot summer<lb/>
temperature, but it was all of no avail.<lb/>
She finally ceased to kick about 9<lb/>
o'clock in the morning, and died with a<lb/>
larger attendance of doctors and<lb/>
nurses around her table than had ever<lb/>
been present around the deathbed of<lb/>
any mere human in the city of Havana.</p>
<p>This account may sound somewhat<lb/>
exaggerated, but the scene still comes<lb/>
back to my mind's eye very vividly--<lb/>
how earnest and serious we all were.<lb/>
Half a dozen of the leading practi-<lb/>
tioners of Havana were sitting around<lb/>
the deathbed of this mosquito, looking<lb/>
and feeling exceedingly mournful and<lb/>
depressed. And it was a very heavy<lb/>
blow to the Health Department of<lb/>
Havana. It was well on into the sum-<lb/>
mer, the month of July, before we suc-<lb/>
ceeded in getting another infected mos-<lb/>
quito and in proceeding with our vacci-<lb/>
nation work.</p>
