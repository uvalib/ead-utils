Charlotte, N. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>While at Charlotte recently I made a survey of so much of the<lb/>
valley of McDowell Creek as will be flooded by the purposed Mountain<lb/>
Island Pond and of its environment within something over a mile of<lb/>
this flowage line. This survey was made to determine (1) the produc-<lb/>
tion of Anopheles (malaria bearing) mosquitoes in the area surveyed and<lb/>
(2), as far as may be, the effect of the pond when filled upon such<lb/>
production. The end sought being to attempt to form an idea of what<lb/>
will be the effect of the pond on the incidence of malaria and to,<lb/>
so far as may be, minimize this production.</p>
<p>I understand that you had requested Dr. Barrett of Charlotte and<lb/>
Dr. Boldridge of Chester (both of whom accompanied me on this survey)<lb/>
to undertake a complete survey of the flowage area of the pond and, I<lb/>
presume, its environment, within a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>This both of these gentlemen inform me they are unable to under-<lb/>
take as it would take them too completely from their present business,<lb/>
but are willing, indeed desireous, of working in assistance of some<lb/>
competent man who could give sufficient time to the job.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I would ask if you would like to have<lb/>
this survey made by the Malaria Division of the Public Health Service.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01002011"/>
Service.<lb/>
2.<lb/>
I do not know if this Service is prepared to undertake this work for<lb/>
you or not--it should begin next spring. If you so wish, you can get<lb/>
information on this point from<lb/>
Surgeon L. D. Fricks, U. S. Public Health Service,<lb/>
Room 17, Court House Building,<lb/>
Memphis, Tenn.</p>
<p>This survey to be complete is rather an extensive affair. It should<lb/>
determine the Anopheles production of the flowage area and environment be-<lb/>
fore the pond is filled, going over the ground as many times as neces-<lb/>
sary; and the same class of survey--of the Pond itself and environment--<lb/>
after the pond is filled for--say--the first two or three years and at in-<lb/>
tervals thereafter.</p>
<p>It would require a competent man and at least one as-<lb/>
sistant most of the time during the Anopheles breeding seasons of 1923 and<lb/>
1924, and at intervals later.</p>
<p>The surveys made hitherto by the Public Health Service have been at<lb/>
its own expense and I judge this would be the case if Dr. Fricks under-<lb/>
took this one. If it be found advisable for either Dr. Barrett or Dr.<lb/>
Boldridge to assist occasionally in any manner, I presume that the Com-<lb/>
pany would wish to reimburse them for their services.</p>
<p>A survey of the kind instanced, planned by myself, was begun of<lb/>
your pond at Fishing Creek, by LePrince and Griffitts, in 1916, but ow-<lb/>
ing to the war was never completed.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
Assistant Surgeon General H. R. Carter,<lb/>
