General J. R. Kean<lb/>
2804 N Street N. W.<lb/>
Georgetown<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I had a delightful and most interesting experience with Mr. Moran for ten<lb/>
days in Havana last month. It is a long story which I hope to tell you in person,<lb/>
if possible within the next few weeks. There are many angles of the story of which<lb/>
I was not aware, some of them most inspiring and some of them, as you know, not too<lb/>
inspiring. I had conversations with Dr. Agramonte's daughter, Dr. Albertini,<lb/>
others of the Finlay Institute, etc. etc. Most important of all, I found that the<lb/>
Cuban government had picked the wrong site of Camp Lazear and already had a temporary<lb/>
memorial up, and were planning a series of memorial buildings. I soon found that<lb/>
they had made a mistake, and spent some time searching for the real site of the camp.<lb/>
We discovered it, and then I had to get documentary evidence to support our claims.<lb/>
I think we convinced the authorities, at least in part. They have asked me to submit<lb/>
a report, and they will appoint a commission to review the matter. This is all<lb/>
aside from my interest in the history of the yellow fever experiments.</p>
<p>Mr. Moran told me that he had presented a second edition of Kelly's book<lb/>
to the University of Virginia library, and Mr. Harry Clemons, librarian, has graciously<lb/>
loaned me this book. Mr. Clemons tells me there is also a very interesting, long<lb/>
letter from you there and that he would be willing to send me photoprint copies of<lb/>
your letter if I have your permission. I should appreciate this courtesy very much<lb/>
indeed, and if you would either write me or Mr. Clemons, I should certainly be glad.</p>
<p>If it is entirely convenient for you, I plan to stop in Washington to call<lb/>
upon you about June 14 or 15. I should like to give you a brief outline of what<lb/>
I have found and to ask you certain questions, perhaps even impose upon your graciousness<lb/>
to have you consult your diary or let me see it regarding the pertinent details of<lb/>
the yellow fever work. I am getting quite a lot of interesting material which I<lb/>
hope to present before the Washington and Jefferson College in October, at the time<lb/>
they dedicate the new Lazear Building. Lazear was a Washington and Jefferson man<lb/>
before he went to Hopkins. I shall also plan to publish this in some medical historical<lb/>
journal. This is aside from the stories by Moran and Kissinger themselves which I<lb/>
hope to get published under their own names.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how much Mr. Moran and I appreciate your offer of help<lb/>
in this matter.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
