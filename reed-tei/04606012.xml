<title>Letter from Philip Showalter Hench to George P. Berry, March 23, 1953</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Hench informs Berry that Maass was an experimental case of yellow fever, but that Ames did not have experimental yellow fever. Furthermore, it is not certain that he had yellow fever at all. Hench suggests that if Ames meets the criteria for a Walter Reed Society award, he would also favor honoring Hanberry, Kissinger, Moran, and Jernegan.</p>

<salute>My dear Doctor Berry:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am sorry for the delay in answering your letter of March 3. I do not know<lb/>
much about the basis for the<del>a</del>awards given by the Walter Reed Society but it<lb/>
seems to me that I read somewhere that it has to be someone who has experi-<lb/>
mented on himself. Clara Maas would come under that heading. Strictly speaking,<lb/>
Dr. Roger Ames would not. Although he exposed himself constantly to yellow<lb/>
fever patients, both before and during the Reed experiments, he never parti-<lb/>
cipated in the experiments himself, directly as a volunteer, that is.</p>
<p>This brings up an interesting controversy. Mrs. Ames is living and has tried<lb/>
for some years to get his services recognized by Congress. There is no question<lb/>
but that he rendered very special and able service to Walter Reed and perhaps<lb/>
it was at least a little behond the call of duty, however it was more or less<lb/>
in line of duty and he certainly did not qualify for the roll of honor.</p>
<p>During this discussion the question has arisen as to whether Doctor Ames himself<lb/>
contracted yellow fever. On occasion it has been the desire of some of his<lb/>
protagonists to indicate that he did develop yellow fever while he was taking<lb/>
care of yellow fever victims but this matter is in dispute. General Truby<lb/>
and General Kean, who were so close to the whole affair, insist that Doctor<lb/>
Ames never had yellow fever despite the claims of Mrs. Ames and others. In-<lb/>
cidentally, Mrs. Ames was considerably younger than Doctor Ames and they<lb/>
were married I think some years after the Cuba episode so that she knows<lb/>
nothing directly. A few years ago I found in one of the collections of clinical<lb/>
notes, I believe in Reed's handwriting, some very brief notes suggesting that<lb/>
Doctor Ames was having yellow fever. The notes do not settle the matter because<lb/>
they are extremely brief and could be used to support either side of the argu-<lb/>
ment. Apparently for at least two or three days he was a yellow fever suspect<lb/>
but the fever chart, which I think I also have (I certainly have seen it) is<lb/>
also unimpressive. In any event, whether or not Doctor Ames had yellow fever, it<lb/>
was not experimental nor did it develop, as I recall it, while he was taking<lb/>
care of the patients at Camp Lazear.</p>
<p>My uncertainty in this matter is occasioned from the fact that I am dictating<lb/>
this in my office from memory and my voluminous files on all these matters are<lb/>
at home.</p>
<p>If Doctor Ames qualified otherwise, even though he was not a volunteer and did<lb/>
not develop experimental yellow fever, I would certainly be in favor of honoring<lb/>
him posthumously, but why not include the one lone surviving voluntter of the<lb/>
experiments, James L. Hanberry, and for that matter, why not include posthumous<lb/>

honors for Moran and Kissinger who were the first two volunteers; also Jernigan<lb/>
who was so remarkable in that he took everything coming, the only man who did<lb/>
this. As I recall it, Jernigan first took the fomites experiment. When that<lb/>
horrible episode was finished, he was game to receive experimental yellow fever<lb/>
which he did, and if my memory serves me, later to prove his immunity he took<lb/>
another inoculation I think intravenously. On the score of willingness, there-<lb/>
fore, he ranks at the top of the list with Moran and Kissinger who, in vol-<lb/>
unteering first, started the ball rolling. There was one notable distinction<lb/>
between Moran and Kissinger. Presumably both refused any money. Moran stuck<lb/>
to his refusal. Kissinger weakened and let it be known that he was willing<lb/>
to reconsider the matter so they gave him a watch and a cash gift of the<lb/>
money, the two equaling what they would have given him as an ordinary<lb/>
volunteer.</p>
