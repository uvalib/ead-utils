<p>I fully intended to<lb/>
Sit down at my desk<lb/>
after Christmas &amp; write you<lb/>
- then surely when I sent<lb/>
you the Subscription to &ldquo;News<lb/>
Week&rdquo; - which Sherman is doing<lb/>
the advertising for - &amp; here<lb/>
it is almost Easter - and<lb/>
your letter, which was most<lb/>
welcome has caused my<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00471002"/>
ears to turn a delicate<lb/>
shade of magenta!!</p>
<p>I am so glad, first of<lb/>
all that you do like &ldquo;News<lb/>
Week&rdquo; - for Sherman - plus<lb/>
a dozen others, all about his<lb/>
age, raised the money for it,<lb/>
&amp; are doing the whole thing.</p>
<p>At the end of one year<lb/>
they had 75,000 subscribers,<lb/>
which, according to Statistics<lb/>
is quite remarkable. It's<lb/>
hard sledding in these<lb/>
times - &amp; Sherman says he<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00471003"/>
MRS. MORGAN JONES<lb/>
35 EAST 76TH STREET<lb/>
NEW YORK CITY<lb/>
hasn't time to think of a<lb/>
wife - but I am so glad<lb/>
that he <hi>is</hi> busy - &amp; likes<lb/>
his job. New York is such<lb/>
a gloom these days - with<lb/>
all the new stock market<lb/>
rulings - many of our friends<lb/>
are going to be out of luck-<lb/>
&amp; nobody seems to know<lb/>
just where we are going to<lb/>
end. Morgan hasn't been<lb/>
well this past year - due<lb/>
as much as anything to<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00471004"/>
worry - &amp; with all our<lb/>
investments gone to pot - it<lb/>
doesn't look very cheery for<lb/>
any more trips for awhile-<lb/>
so we'll just have to stay<lb/>
here &amp; wait developments.</p>
<p>We are on the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> floor<lb/>
of the &ldquo;Carlyle&rdquo; - with good<lb/>
air - a grand view of<lb/>
the Park - &amp; floods of sun-<lb/>
shine (when there is any!) so it's<lb/>
a good summer resort.<lb/>
And we haven't been<lb/>
away for nearly four years!<lb/>
We have all our own furniture<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00471005"/>

about us - and a cute<lb/>
little spick &amp; span kitchenette<lb/>
So when Hotel meals pall<lb/>
we can have a maid come<lb/>
in. In the intervals Sherman<lb/>
is a grand cook -- really<lb/>
he can do anything from broil-<lb/>
ing a lobster &amp; making waffles-<lb/>
and I am strong on salads-<lb/>
So we're very cosy &amp; it gives<lb/>
me a rest from housekeeping.</p>
<p>I was so interested to<lb/>
hear that Houston had<lb/>
succumbed, at last, and I'm<lb/>
so glad you like the girl.</p>
<p>Doesn't it seem a century<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00471006"/>
ago that we had small<lb/>
infants in San Francisco!</p>
<p>I hear from Sister Helen<lb/>
now &amp; then. Her life seems<lb/>
peaceful, at least. Henrietta<lb/>
still lives in Florence - &amp;<lb/>
with the bologny dollar<lb/>
at 54 cents, she is finding<lb/>
it a bit difficult - but<lb/>
give me poverty in Florence<lb/>
rather than anywhere over<lb/>
here.! She often asks for you</p>
<p>It <hi>doesn't seem</hi> possible that<lb/>
your Mother &amp; Jane have gone<lb/>

since we saw you last-<lb/>
and then Phil's death<lb/>
followed Mother's in three<lb/>
years. &amp; two years later<lb/>
Agnes died - so now I<lb/>
have no one in this Country<lb/>
belonging <hi>to me</hi> really, except<lb/>
Sherman &amp; Morgan. I envy you<lb/>
being in Santa Barbara.<lb/>
I always loved it better<lb/>
than any other spot, &amp;<lb/>
I am sure you are doing<lb/>
nice things with a garden.<lb/>
Do you ever see Adah Cooper?<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f00471008"/>
give her my love when you do,<lb/>
&amp; write me about her &amp; all<lb/>
the other things I'll love to hear.<lb/>
Is Peggy in Berkeley still, or<lb/>
in Santa Barbara. The other day<lb/>
I went with a scientifically<lb/>
minded friend (a very interesting<lb/>
woman) to see &ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo;<lb/>
and was tremendously im-<lb/>
pressed by it. It was so<lb/>
beautifully handled - the<lb/>
action sincere - the lighting<lb/>
&amp; off stage singing kept one<lb/>
continually in the spirit of<lb/>
1900 - and the whole thing<lb/>
such sermon in the patience<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f00471009"/>

it requires for any scientific<lb/>
research to see its reward.<lb/>
It begins in London - in 1927<lb/>
showing that the Doctors there<lb/>
were reaping the benefits of<lb/>
the sacrifices made in Cuba<lb/>
so long ago! Dr Lazear is<lb/>
the real hero - of the play-<lb/>
a dynamic role - You could<lb/>
never bear to see it - but<lb/>
I reached out my hand to<lb/>
you across the Continent<lb/>
when taps were sounded<lb/>
and said to myself - &ldquo;No'<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f00471010"/>
it was <hi>not</hi> waste.&rdquo;-<lb/>
It would make you very<lb/>
proud indeed to see him<lb/>
34 years later - the living<lb/>
hero of a great achievement</p>
<p>Time heals all -</p>
<p>I am sending you the<lb/>
programme. We all send<lb/>
love - &amp; Sherman is so<lb/>
delighted that his baby<lb/>
appeals to you. They have had<lb/>
many compliments on their veracity<lb/>
accuracy and the smartness of<lb/>
their condensed news of the day.</p>
