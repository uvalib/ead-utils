Mr. A. V. McClain<lb/>
Washington and Jefferson College<lb/>
Washington, Pennsylvania<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. McClain:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your local photographer was kind enough to take some movies of the<lb/>
morning ceremony on Founders' Day, inside the gymnasium, and he also took some<lb/>
that evening at the banquet. A friend of mine who happened to be there, took<lb/>
a colored film of the procession, looking toward the gymnasium, which is<lb/>
rather colorful and includes scenes not taken by your photographer, so far as<lb/>
I know. I am afraid that the inside scenes, taken in the morning and evening,<lb/>
are so dark that they are only good for house projection and at rather close<lb/>
range. I have just spliced the whole film together, and rather than unsplice<lb/>
it (because I am fairly sure that you will not wish copies) I am sending you<lb/>
the whole film. You can have it projected, and I am sure you will agree that<lb/>
these inside scenes are hardly clear enough to show at any large gathering.<lb/>
I think they would be merely annoyed, and the rest of your nice film would be<lb/>
spoiled. So far as I am concerned, they are quite all right. I merely project<lb/>
them at fairly close range in the house, and they are a very nice souvenir.</p>
<p>May I make a suggestion? In order to fill in the continuity of your<lb/>
own film, may I suggest that you merely have your photographer take successive<lb/>
moving pictures of the half dozen stills which he took inside the gymnasium, and<lb/>
if you wish, those at the evening banquet. These stills are very good, and if<lb/>
only about five feet are shown, the audience will hardly realize they are stills.<lb/>
When sending stills to the Eastman Co. to have movies made of them, Eastman usually<lb/>
sends a generous footage of each still, at least ten feet or so. I have found that<lb/>
this is quite too much, and without motion is boring. About five feet are much<lb/>
better. If you would like to do this, I shall be glad to pay for that half of<lb/>
the motion picture footage of the pictures which you will probably discard.<lb/>
Should you decide to have parts of my movie film duplicated after all, you do<lb/>
not have to disassemble it. Your photographer can indicate that portion to be<lb/>
copied, either by a little adhesive strip at the beginning and end of the part<lb/>
to be copied, or by a thread.</p>
<p>I should appreciate the return of the film at your earliest convenience.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
