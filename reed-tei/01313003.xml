MARINE HOSPITAL SERVICE<lb/>

<p>pense of the <unclear>vessel</unclear> &amp; the acute diseases will be<lb/>
treated in the Marine-Hospital until one can be<lb/>
built on <unclear>Ellis</unclear> Island the U. S. Immig<add>r</add>ation landing.<lb/>
The N. Y. Commissioners were so corrupt &amp; there was so little, or<lb/>
rather <hi>no</hi>, confidence in them in the West where most<lb/>
of the immigrants go. that the U. S. was well nigh compel-<lb/>
led to take charge. Whether they will do any better remains<lb/>
to be seen. <hi>Our</hi> men will as they are not political-<unclear>appointees</unclear>.<lb/>
I don't exactly see why we had to get into it, it is an<lb/>
<unclear>onerous</unclear> service, &amp; no extra pay; but I suppose because we<lb/>
are the only medical bureau with a lot of miscel-<lb/>
laneous functions &amp; under the Treasury.</p>
<p>Also a new bill for &ldquo;<unclear>Inter state</unclear> Quarantine&rdquo; (due to<lb/>
the Fla. yellow fever?) passed in April that pos-<lb/>
sibly adds to our efficiency but certainly does to<lb/>
our duties &amp; as little as I like <unclear>Maritime</unclear> Quar-<lb/>
antine I should like the Inland still <unclear>less</unclear>.</p>

<p>I think the service was far <unclear>pleasanter</unclear> to its officers when it was<lb/>
merely a Hospital Service still every one must feel a certain<lb/>
gratification in serving an increase of usefulness<lb/>
in his corps &amp; I believe the main reasons of extension of<lb/>
function are (1) we have less (1/10 as much) &ldquo;red tape&rdquo; <del>on</del><add>than</add> the Army<lb/>
or Navy <add>&amp; <unclear>are</unclear> easier to get started</add>: (2) a clause which forbids any increase of Compen-<lb/>
sation or receipt of any fee. (3) (I hope) efficiency of previous<lb/>
work. But I must say we have some men who are<lb/>
not worth their salt; two resigned (<unclear>under compact</unclear> this<lb/>
spring. I think the younger men average better than <hi>the older ones</hi>.<lb/>
Henry was improved by his trip to <unclear>Biloxi</unclear>: eats better etc. The<lb/>
others are well, <unclear>save my Jan</unclear>.</p>
<p>We are not quite as ready for Q. as I could wish, an account of the weath-<lb/>
er, but ready enough to get along &amp; if I can get one week free it<lb/>
will do very well. <unclear>Love</unclear> to all at N. R. &amp; in Ashland<lb/>
How are you &amp; the boys getting as the weather gets <unclear>warmer</unclear>?</p>

Monday afternoon,<lb/>
Face better decidedly better but averages bad, I will <hi>not</hi> have the<lb/>
dead <unclear>bone</unclear> &amp; outside <unclear>abcess wh'</unclear> sometimes <unclear>came</unclear> &amp; it may be that the<lb/>
<unclear>alveolar</unclear> process will separate as a whole instead of absorbing as it <unclear>sh'd</unclear><lb/>
(night.) The heaviest <add>sudden</add> squall I ever saw came this afternoon &amp; drove the<lb/>
Annie ashore- she is <unclear>unhurt</unclear> but is on bare ground draws <hi>3</hi> feet &amp; we<lb/>
will have trouble getting her <unclear>off.</unclear> &amp; will not be able to go <unclear>over</unclear> tomorrow,<lb/>
I order (from Louisville) $1.00 of roses for Hugh by this mail. Don't put them<lb/>
where water will stand on the <hi>roots</hi>. Put the <unclear>Marichal</unclear> Niel in the most<lb/>
favored place. as it is delicate for one year. it is a climber. (Except <unclear>La France</unclear> &amp;<lb/>
Catherine <unclear>Mermet.</unclear> which are dwarfs almost. the others are <unclear>bush</unclear> roses of good<lb/>
growth.<lb/>
Hugh had best set the roses in a little bed about <hi>18</hi> inches a-<lb/>
part until fall when they should be good sized <unclear>but</unclear> shes &amp; he<lb/>
<unclear>can</unclear> can move them<lb/>
