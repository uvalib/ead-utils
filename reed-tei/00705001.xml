<salute>Dear Ma;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I haven't written to you for nearly a month.<lb/>
Nevertheless we are all moderately well here, Laura is I think<lb/>
very well- hasn't been so all the time but has not been sick &amp; is cer-<lb/>
tainly well now. I was a little sick yesterday &amp; have been<lb/>
under the weather all winter feel better today than I have for some-<lb/>
time. Things are better than last year, but this is the<lb/>
most aggravating post I have ever had in every respect<lb/>
save climate. I believe the climate suits me.</p>
<p>We rather hope that the winter is over. There has been<lb/>
a great deal more cold weather than last winter<lb/>
but none so cold as the cold spell. There has been a<lb/>
freeze about 2 days in a fortnight-slight freeze. The<lb/>
wind here during a blizzard is horrible. I never saw such<lb/>
a wind save for 2 days in S. F.</p>
<p>We have had an uncommonly dry winter - today is the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00705002"/>
first hard rain I've since sin summer &amp; I think<lb/>
about 8 inches must have fallen. Taken altogether a<lb/>
better climatic winter than last one.</p>
<p>I think Mary is about well- her throat is not but<lb/>
not bad, but her dyspepsia seems, to be all right<lb/>
She is <add>in</add> much better spirits than when in San Francisco,<lb/>
indeed something like other girls- save more unselfish<lb/>
Our cow has gone dry for about a month- hence we will<lb/>
have a milk bill until some time in April. I think<lb/>
I think we will have things green here in <add>about</add> 2 weeks<lb/>
It has been so dry &amp; there has been so much dry grass that I have been<lb/>
afraid of fire</p>
<p>I had a letter from Jno Dox yesterday; He seems to be doing<lb/>
moderately well. I was favorably impressed with him when I saw<lb/>
him &amp; he writes with less reserve than he used to. I will send him<lb/>
the journals that I take. I am not filing them &amp; they ought to do<lb/>
him a great deal of good.</p>
<p>I have not written to Ned since he went abroad,<lb/>
have been feeling to mean to do so, If I continue as<lb/>
I promise today I will write this week,</p>
<p>We had one case of Lock Jaw last week - negro is under Dr. Pelters care - who<lb/>
died. They generally do <add>of Lock Jaw not of D. P.)</add> we have some very sick patients, but not<lb/>
many- not so many as last year. I am now changing the<lb/>
hot water system of the wards &amp; have authority to get bids for the<lb/>
repair of the Steward's house. I hope that that is all of the work<lb/>
which <del>the</del> I will be allowed to do this spring. The children<lb/>
are a great deal stronger <add>Put out trees</add> than last year. Eat well &amp; sleep well.<lb/>
How is everything at North <unclear>River</unclear> I wish you would write me of all the<lb/>
farming &amp; everything else there.</p>
<p>Give my love to all there at<unclear>Hills</unclear>.</p>
<p>This is nearly as late as you can send rose slips.<lb/>
I have just written to Ned</p>
