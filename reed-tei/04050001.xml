<title>Letter from Philip Showalter Hench to John W. Hart, October 16, 1944</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Hench writes that he enjoyed reading Hart's article on Building No. 1. He clarifies some misconceptions in this article. Hench mentions Moran and notes that he more or less serves as Hench's personal representative in Cuba. Hench discusses his efforts to raise money for the Camp Lazear memorial.</p>

Attention: Doctor Hart,<lb/>
Head of Research Division.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Hart:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I recently received the Annotated Bibliography on Penicillin.<lb/>
Your second series, published January 1944, I have found of great use.<lb/>
I wonder whether I could obtain a copy of the first series. I would<lb/>
appreciate it greatly.</p>
<p>Incidentally, someone sent me a couple of articles in a little<lb/>
magazine published in Havana by your company. I noticed an interesting<lb/>
little article on building no. 1 of Yellow Fever fame, and I suspect that<lb/>
you wrote it. It was a very nice article indeed. I would like to have<lb/>
a half dozen more if you have them available, and, incidentally, I want<lb/>
to relieve some of your fears: In that article, you expressed disappoint-<lb/>
ment that already parts of the original building were apparently being<lb/>
removed; for example, the porch. As a matter of fact, the porch never<lb/>
did belong to the original building. Moran more or less acts as my per-<lb/>
sonal representative there, and I agreed with him that the porch, which<lb/>
was falling in, should be removed. I had the roof repaired. I wish in-<lb/>
deed I could collect enough money and had the time to conclude my little<lb/>
campaign for the preservation of this building. I already have about<lb/>
$11,000 but it will take much more than that to build a suitable memorial.<lb/>
It may be that we might better ask the occupants to vacate and it might<lb/>
be better for me to spend now three or four hundred dollars to have a<lb/>
wooden protecting frame put over the whole thing, with tar paper, etc.,<lb/>
etc. to preserve the building until such time after the War as I can con-<lb/>
clude my campaign. I am going to send a carbon copy of this letter to<lb/>
Mr. Moran and will ask him, if he has leisure to do so, to look into the<lb/>
matter for me.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
