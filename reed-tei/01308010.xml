<p>I shall be grateful for <del>its</del><add>their</add> return as soon as you have finished with <del>it</del><add><unclear>them</unclear></add>.</p>
<p>Father's first three articles on the incubation of yellow<lb/>
fever. I deeply regret that I have no copies that I can send you. My<lb/>
brother, Dr. Henry Rose Carter, Jr., says, however, that by sending a<lb/>
minimal sum (less than a dollar) to the A. M. A. in Chicago, they will<lb/>
send any member <unclear></unclear> from their files, extending far beyond the time<lb/>
when these articles were written. Also, they have a large and varied<lb/>
collection of medical journals, so I hope that you will have no trouble.<lb/>
I enclose exact names of the <xref id="f01308011">articles</xref> and journals in which they were<lb/>
published. "A note on the interval' etc. was the one determining the di-<lb/>
rection of Reed's experiments, published, N. O. Med. &amp;. Surg. Jour. May 1900</p>
<p>Father though extremely well of the work of Strobel and had made a note<lb/>
to include an appreciation of it in his book. He died before he could do<lb/>
this, however. In a marginal note (in Father's handwriting) I find: "It was<lb/>
a question of <hi>words</hi> only &amp; the dispute ended when Strobel of Charleston, S. C.<lb/>
(about 1840) substituted the word &ldquo;transmissible&rdquo; for &ldquo;contagious<unclear>.</unclear>&rdquo; We now say<lb/>
&ldquo;communicable.&rdquo; This note on p. 78 of &ldquo;William Crawford Gorgas.&rdquo; Doubleday<lb/>
Page &amp; Co. (1924) by Marie D. Gorgas and Burton Hendrick.</p>
<p><hi>Re</hi> Nott: In The Practice of Medicine in the Tropics, Oxford Press, Lon-<lb/>
don, v. ii, p. 1233: &ldquo;Beauperthuy and Nott, the former especially, are<lb/>
frequently mentioned as having formulated the same doctrine as Finlay and<lb/>
before him. Beauperthuy taught that a mosquito by biting a well man pro-<lb/>
duced the disease, the insect getting the infection (or poison?) from the<lb/>
&lsquo;putrid&rsquo; mud and slime of brackish marshes. To him yellow fever was an<lb/>
intoxication; the source of infection being the &lsquo;putrid&rsquo; marsh. Nott did<lb/>
not teach <hi>conveyance</hi> at all. He thought a &lsquo;minute insect&rsquo;, living on or<lb/>
near the ground, entered the body of a man and was <hi>itself</hi> the cause of<lb/>
yellow fever. Whether the progress of this &lsquo;insect&rsquo; was by growth, like<lb/>
mould, as Faget thought, or by mechanical progression (legs or wings) is<lb/>
not stated. His idea is rather the forerunner of the microbean origin<lb/>
of disease than of metaxeny. Neither Beauperthuy nor Nott, ingenious as<lb/>
were their theories, are rivals of Finlay in the promulgation of the doc-<lb/>
trine of conveyance of yellow fever from the sick to the well by the mos-<lb/>
quito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have no clear recollection of Father's evaluation of the work of<lb/>
Agrippa Nelson Bell. This is not strange, as our work, after Father's<lb/>
return from Peru, when he began his History of Yellow Fever, was along<lb/>
very definite lines (as you will see when you read the book) and Bell would<lb/>
have been mentioned in a much later<unclear>.</unclear> Section than that which terminates<lb/>
the present book.</p>
<p>Wishing you all manner of success in your paper and looking forward<lb/>
much to seeing it when it appears, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>
