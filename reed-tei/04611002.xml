Mrs. Blossom Reed<lb/>
Blue Ridge Summit<lb/>
Pennsylvania<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs. Reed:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am most apologetic for my delay in the matter of the books. I have been<lb/>
constantly on the go and have been excessively busy; my work also was inter-<lb/>
rupted recently by an annoying respiratory infection. But let me give you<lb/>
this report.</p>
<p>I was in New York for just a morning about a month ago and got in touch with<lb/>
Miss Benjamin, one of the <unclear>leading</unclear> autograph <unclear>dealers</unclear> in New York. I did not<lb/>
have the books with me but I told her of them; however I did not mention<lb/>
your name (yet). She told me what I was afraid I would hear, namely that an<lb/>
autographed book, unless the book itself is of marked value, constitutes<lb/>
hardly more than an autograph and is of considerably less value than an<lb/>
autographed letter, which is the lowest item in the scale of holographic<lb/>
material. Of course your father's local address adds a little to the value<lb/>
more than if he had simply written his name.</p>
<p>Without seeing the books, Miss Benjamin made a tentative offer (which she<lb/>
reserved the right to change up or down) of &ldquo;about $10 a volume.&rdquo; She said,<lb/>
&ldquo;Of course I can't say <unclear>untill</unclear> I see the books or know what they are and can<lb/>
see whether I could sell them for $20 or $25 each. Essentially, they are<lb/>
merely autographs.&rdquo; Apparently such dealers expect to make 100 per cent<lb/>
profit when they can sell things. I know of course that every now and then<lb/>
they sell things that they have had in their stock for quite a while at<lb/>
lower prices of one to <unclear>ten</unclear> dollars each. I have now sent her the formal<lb/>
list of the books. The books are safely still in my possession. I don't<lb/>
want to send them to anyone until they give me a specific offer or show<lb/>
greater interest. Incidentally, I was a little disappointed to note that<lb/>
the 5th volume of the five-volume series does not have your father's name<lb/>
or any inscription.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have enlisted the help of our head librarian here at the Mayo<lb/>
Clinic who will help me find out the value of the books simply as books,<lb/>
medical or otherwise.</p>
<p>I have also written to <unclear>Goodspeeds</unclear>, of Boston, one of the outstanding book<lb/>
or letter stores in the country. If their offers are not satisfactory, I<lb/>
will write to other companies and of course transmit all of the offers to<lb/>

you who shall decide where they will go. In the meantime, rest assure that<lb/>
without knowing anything about their commercial value, I will certainly<lb/>
match the tentative offer of Miss Benjamin. Just for my own pleasure and<lb/>
interest I will guarantee you what she suggested.</p>
