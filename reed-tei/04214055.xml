Mr. G. Meredith Brill<lb/>
Managing Editor the Pharos<lb/>
Slaterville Springs, New York<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Brill:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of April 16, informing me that you plan to<lb/>
publish the lecture on Walter Reed and the Conquest of Yellow Fever, which<lb/>
I gave at the University of Virginia, November 17, 1947, before the Alpha<lb/>
Omega Alpha Chapter and the medical school faculty. I didn't know this<lb/>
was being <unclear></unclear> to you for publication. I was asked to send to the University<lb/>
a couple of copies from which news items were made for the Alumni News, etc.<lb/>
However, I shall be glad to have you publish it. The first five or six<lb/>
pages have been &ldquo;more or less&rdquo; published elsewhere; namely, in Hygeia several<lb/>
years ago but I have revised it somewhat since then so that it has not been<lb/>
published exactly in this form and the last six pages have never been pub-<lb/>
lished in any form. I was saving it for a later general publication but<lb/>
since the circulation of the Pharos is limited and select, I don't believe<lb/>
your use of it will interfere with its later publication. Incidentally what<lb/>
is the circulation of the Pharos?</p>
<p>I don't know what copy you have, whether it was my preliminary type-<lb/>
written copy or a mimeographed copy. I had about 30 requests for copies of<lb/>
the talk after giving it at the University and had it mimeographed hastily.<lb/>
Not intending it for publication, I did not concern myself about a few little<lb/>
errors that I picked up but I am sending you herewith a corrected copy which<lb/>
I should prefer you to use.</p>
<p>You request a cut or photo of Doctor Reed. I enclose two prints of<lb/>
the conventional photograph of Reed. They aren't very good but they are all I<lb/>
have at the moment as a great amount of my material is on loan at the Univer-<lb/>
sity of Virginia Library and some more I have just sent to New York to the<lb/>
Hall of Fame. May I suggest that you write to the editor of the University of<lb/>
Virginia Alumni News. In their February 1948 issue they used a cut of Walter<lb/>
Reed and will undoubtedly lend it to you. Should you wish to use a photograph<lb/>
of the remains of Reed's famous &ldquo;Building Number One&rdquo; I can send you a <unclear>print</unclear> of<lb/>
a photograph which I took just last month in Cuba.</p>
<p>I notice that you plan to send this to print almost immediately.<lb/>
Would it be possible for me to read proof? I always like to do that with my<lb/>
articles, otherwise almost always some small errors are perpetuated. If you<lb/>
send it to me air mail, I promise to read it the night it comes and send it<lb/>
back air mail the next day. Also, could I get some reprints, perhaps 200 or<lb/>
300. They would be useful to me.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
