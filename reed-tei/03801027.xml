Office of the Commandant<lb/>
The Medical Field Service School<lb/>
Carlisle Barracks<lb/>
Carlisle, Pa.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In August and September of last year, I corresponded with<lb/>
Brigadier General Roger Brooke regarding a model of Camp Columbia, Havana,<lb/>
Cuba, 1900, which had been for some years in storage at Carlisle Barracks.<lb/>
I found a photograph of this model in the U. S. Army Medical Museum, Negative<lb/>
#47033. This photograph is of great importance to me in my attempts to<lb/>
identify properly the sites in Havana where Walter Reed and colleagues did<lb/>
their work on yellow fever. The railroad track along remains. General<lb/>
Brooke in a letter to me dated July 5, 1940, said that the model had not been<lb/>
set up because they did not know how to fit it properly. I sent them a copy<lb/>
of the Army Museum's photograph and on my request, General Brooke kindly<lb/>
had the model set up again and photographed for me, as the Army Museum's<lb/>
photographs were not very adequate. I have been corresponding with General<lb/>
Albert E. Truby, retired, who in 1900 was commanding officer at this Post<lb/>
Hospital at Columbia Barracks. He informs me that the model was obviously<lb/>
set up wrong in Washington before the Army Museum's photograph was taken and<lb/>
that it should be re-arranged roughly as I have indicated by repasting the<lb/>
enclosed photograph.</p>
<p>Dr. Domingo Ramos, Minister of National Defense of the Cuban<lb/>
government, has asked me to present to him documentary evidence identifying<lb/>
the former location of this hospital and of Camp Lazear. I expect to visit<lb/>
Havana in March to present this evidence to him. I would be very grateful<lb/>
indeed if you could arrange to have the model set up properly according to<lb/>
the arrangement noted by General Truby, and have it rephotographed for me<lb/>
from in front and from either side rather than from only on top, as was done<lb/>
in the enclosed photograph. Whatever expense there is connected with this I<lb/>
shall be glad to pay. I believe that General Truby will be writing you about<lb/>
this matter also. The model has assumed such historical importance, being<lb/>
about the only record we can find available, showing the arrangement of the<lb/>
buildings, that General Truby has stated his tentative desire to visit Carlisle<lb/>
sometime in the future to help set it up properly. Since it is impossible for<lb/>
me to wait until that time I will greatly appreciate the photographs of the<lb/>
model as rearranged.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
