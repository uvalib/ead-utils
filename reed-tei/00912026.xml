<p>Excerpt of letter to Miss Florence Read from Henry Hanson, Chiclayo, Peru,<lb/>
August 4, 1921.</p>
<p>We are working up a very full report on the whole campaign, and I<lb/>
believe we will get it up in a very graphic form as well. I have considered<lb/>
the expense of this justified in that I think this is going to be the last<lb/>
yellow fever campaign on this coast for a few centuries to come, and it ought<lb/>
to be properly recorded. Dr. White will bring up an illustrated charts of what<lb/>
has been a little less than one fifth of the entire campaign so from that you<lb/>
will be able to judge what we have had on our hands.</p>
<p>Next week we will begin the final clean up of Ferrenafe, and when that is<lb/>
done we will have the watching of the coast to see that the stegomyia index is<lb/>
not allowed to rise until we are certain that there is nothing &ldquo;lurking in the<lb/>
bush&rdquo;. We have everything else to the north of the Department of Ancash<lb/>
down to less than three percent and most of it is about one percent of breeding<lb/>
In many places it is even less.</p>
<p>In my last letter to Mr. Kirk and also to Dr. Rose I told of having<lb/>
started prophylactic work in the Department of Ancash as a means of guarding<lb/>
against the spread of the epidemic south. This work will continue until we<lb/>
are sure of the conditions up here in the north. Fortunately all the news<lb/>
lately from the south have been good news. Today I received a telegram from<lb/>
Dr. Caballero who has made a series of investigations in Lima in the Hospitals<lb/>
in which he states that he has been unable to find any reliable reports of the<lb/>
existence of cases in Lima. Dr. Mendoza also went to Lima for the Centennial<lb/>
and also is investigating for any suspicious case or history of case which<lb/>
might have gotten by. So far none have been reported from my own men, which<lb/>
makes me feel happier.</p>
