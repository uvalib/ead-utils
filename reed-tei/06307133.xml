<title>Letter from Jefferson Randolph Kean to Philip Showalter Hench, December 26, 1941</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Kean makes comments on the contents of the notebook found at the New York Academy of Medicine. He had recommended Carroll for volunteer commission of major, but it didn't happen. He discusses very positively the career of Russell. He thinks Andrus could sell his memoir for a good price. He includes a memorandum listing papers he read about the life and work of Carroll in 1907, shortly after his death.</p>

Please give Mrs. Hench our thanks for the pretty<lb/>
card and good wishes-<lb/>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been intending to write<lb/>
to you ever since your letter came<lb/>
written on the 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> But I was sick<lb/>
with influenza at that time, and not<lb/>
being endowed with the free acting <unclear>supra<lb/>
renal</unclear> glands that the good Lord gave<lb/>
to you and General Ireland, I did<lb/>
not <unclear>seem</unclear> to be able to do anything but<lb/>
blow my nose for 10 days and then<lb/>
cough my head off for 10 more- By<lb/>
that time the <unclear>snowstorm</unclear> of Christmas<lb/>
Cards struck me and I just had to<lb/>
send off my copies of the <unclear>Conquerors</unclear><lb/>
with the Xmas Greetings of <unclear>No. 7</unclear>.<lb/>
<unclear>done</unclear> up in mailing tubes- So here<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06307134"/>
C<lb/>
K<lb/>
I am writing<lb/>
2<lb/>
with a guilty conscience and a haunt-<lb/>
ing fear that you will scratch me<lb/>
off your list of correspondents-<lb/>
Todays mail brings your interesting<lb/>
letter to Truby and me <unclear>jointly</unclear>, with<lb/>
the copy of the photostat that Miss Wood<lb/>
sent you, the air view of the hospital<lb/>
&ldquo;Dr. Aristides Agramonte&rdquo; &amp; the leaflet<lb/>
about the contract- I did not know that<lb/>
Lazear assisted Reed in his Electrozone<lb/>
survey- but it was natural that he<lb/>
should do so- The names of the Quema-<lb/>
dos cases appear very familiar- poor<lb/>
little Jacob Caesar, a little Jew tailor<lb/>
and his brother Hyman who lived at 89 <unclear>Rd.</unclear><lb/>
I felt very sorry for them- they seemed<lb/>
so friendless and so frightened- I think<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06307135"/>
both of them died-</p>
<p>The urine <unclear>analyses</unclear> of Folk Sonntag &amp; West<lb/>
mentioned about middle of your page 2<lb/>
I think must have been routine examinations<lb/>
A. O. would certainly stand for Albumen none<lb/>
I think- <unclear>These</unclear> men were taken ill after Feb 3<lb/>
I think but their urine was examined to<lb/>
be sure they did not have some albumen<lb/>
before the illness- Page 3 <unclear>M. &amp; P. Rolls</unclear><lb/>
means <unclear>muster</unclear> &amp; Pay Rolls, but I didnt<lb/>
suppose Reed had any concern with them<lb/>
It may be that he had to carry his laboratory<lb/>
men on all <unclear>M &amp; P Roll</unclear> as a detachment<lb/>
while they were in Cuba- It must have<lb/>
been that when Reed left Cuba Feb. 9, 1901<lb/>
Agramonte was <unclear>released</unclear> from the Board<lb/>
so as to return to his routine duties in<lb/>
Havana under the Chief Surgeon there-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06307136"/>
4-<lb/>
Carroll stayed on in Cuba until <unclear>March</unclear><lb/>
1901 I believe but I dont know what he<lb/>
was doing there- I think that Gen. Stern-<lb/>
berg was thinking of getting him a<lb/>
Volunteer Commission of Major and had<lb/>
suggested that he should be in Cuba<lb/>
<unclear>when</unclear> the matter was brought up-<lb/>
I had made a <unclear>recommendation</unclear> in<lb/>
the autumn about the Vol. majority<lb/>
but it never came to pass-</p>
<p>I am inclosing a memo about the me-<lb/>
morial meeting in Baltimore after Car-<lb/>
roll's death- I have it bound in with<lb/>
other reprints and will send you the<lb/>
volume if you do not find the J. H. H.<lb/>
Bulletin of Jan 1908 in the library of the<lb/>
Hospital- Most of the articles refer to<lb/>
Sanitary matters in Cuba in 1907-8<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06307137"/>
5<lb/>
2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
<unclear>The</unclear> Nationalization of the municipal San-<lb/>
itary services in Cuba and other matters<lb/>
which were very important but of lit-<lb/>
tle interest to you I imagine- One of them<lb/>
is a long address by Dr. L&oacute;pez del Valle<lb/>
J&eacute;f&eacute; local de Sanidad of Havana at<lb/>
the &ldquo;solemn session&rdquo; of the Junta Nacional<lb/>
de Sanidad when the portraits of Gov.<lb/>
Magoon, Dr. Carlos Finlay and myself<lb/>
were unveiled in the Sala of the office<lb/>
He traced the record of sanitary accom<lb/>
plishments from 1899 to 1909 and shower<lb/>
ed us with flattering phrases, as only<lb/>
a latin can do- I am going to send<lb/>
this volume ultimately to the <unclear>Alderman<lb/>
Library</unclear> at the <unclear>Univ.</unclear> of Va. where they have<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06307138"/>
6<lb/>
a corner for these Cuban matters<lb/>
including the Yellow Fever Episode-<lb/>
I am sorry that I did not realize that<lb/>
you would be interested in Col. <unclear>Havards</unclear><lb/>
fall report and so I took out the<lb/>
pictures and threw away the statistical<lb/>
tables and reports from other stations<lb/>
in Cuba just because the latter were<lb/>
bulky. With reference to your letter of<lb/>
Nov. 30 Gen. Ireland and I had a<lb/>
little laugh at your inquiry &ldquo;who is<lb/>
Dr. F. F. Russell of whom you speak-&rdquo;<lb/>
Russell succeeded Reed as the Army top<lb/>
man in preventive medecine. He made<lb/>
typhoid immunization practical by devel-<lb/>
oping a culture which largely did away<lb/>
with the very severe reactions of the <unclear>wright</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06307139"/>
7<lb/>
serum- So our army was the first to<lb/>
make immunization compulsory like<lb/>
vaccination against small pox and in<lb/>
two years typhoid disappeared from our<lb/>
list of serious causes of death or disability<lb/>
After the World War I the Rockefeller Founda-<lb/>
tion came after Russell and by giving<lb/>
him 4 times his Army pay &amp; allowances<lb/>
got him &amp; put him in charge of their<lb/>
preventive disease work all over the<lb/>
world- He held this job until his<lb/>
retirement for age where Harvard grab-<lb/>
bed him to deliver lectures at their<lb/>
medical school until he reached their<lb/>
age limit- I said <add>to Ireland that</add> I was going to write<lb/>
to you to look in Whos Who, but after<lb/>
we read that we agreed that it was<lb/>
a very inadequate presentation of the<lb/>
wonderful work that Russell has done-<lb/>
He guided the preventative medical work<lb/>
of our army <unclear>1917-1920</unclear> so smoothly and<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06307140"/>
8<lb/>
efficiently that it did not make news<lb/>
for the press- I was amused when I read<lb/>
the very clever and amusing work of fiction<lb/>
of Dr. Victor George Heiser &ldquo;A Doctors Odessey&rdquo;,<lb/>
to see that he only mentioned Russell's<lb/>
name once- You would never have guessed<lb/>
that Russell was his chief and had<lb/>
to fire him for not making good on his job-<lb/>
He also ignored Walter Reed's work in<lb/>
the same way, and where a friend of<lb/>
Reed's wrote to ask him why, he<lb/>
wrote the cleverest letter saying that<lb/>
he had a whole chapter on Reed &amp;<lb/>
the Publisher cut it out because his<lb/>
book was too long! I think Andrus ought<lb/>
to be able to sell his &ldquo;Tale of a Guinea Pig&rdquo;<lb/>
at a good price- It is so simply and<lb/>
modestly told- I was delighted with it.<lb/>
He had a few errors &amp; slips in it which<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f06307141"/>
9<lb/>
2804 N STREET, N. W.<lb/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
I corrected, such as the statement that<lb/>
there had been no yellow fever in Cuba<lb/>
since 1902- I heard my friend Dr. Franklin<lb/>
Martin make that statement in a lecture here<lb/>
in Wash. once &amp; after the lecture I went up<lb/>
to him &amp; said &ldquo;<unclear>Apropos</unclear> of yellow fever in<lb/>
Havana what do you think I was doing<lb/>
in Cuba between 1906 and 1908&rdquo;? He said<lb/>
&ldquo;What were you doing&rdquo;? &ldquo;Fighting Yellow<lb/>
fever&rdquo; was my answer-</p>
<p>Well I am <unclear>running</unclear> on as old men will<lb/>
and have got quite far away from<lb/>
your investigation- I will send you<lb/>
some old papers before the end of the<lb/>
year to glance over &amp; <unclear>threw</unclear> away-<lb/>
any that you think of some historical<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f06307142"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
10<lb/>
interest thought not in connection with<lb/>
your work please put aside and<lb/>
pass on to Mr. Harry Clemons, librarian<lb/>
of the Alderman Library at the <unclear>Univ.</unclear> of Va.<lb/>
He seems to like as you do to look through<lb/>
old papers. I am happy to know<lb/>
that you will be coming this way<lb/>
next month- The <unclear>hotels</unclear> here are full<lb/>
to the doors so you had better let me<lb/>
secure you a room at the Army<lb/>
&amp; Navy Club which I can do if you<lb/>
give me a few days notice of the date<lb/>
I am sorry I have no spare room here<lb/>
at home- Every room in Washington is<lb/>
full they say- I think the <unclear>photographic</unclear><lb/>
section of the Signal Corps might find<lb/>
you a lot of good pictures- The Archives<lb/>
Bldg ought to have Gen. Woods Reports-<lb/>
With cordial regards and wishing you a happy<lb/>
New Year</p>
<p>Sincerely<lb/>
