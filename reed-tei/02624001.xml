Keep<lb/>
up a<lb/>
cheerful<lb/>
heart-<lb/>
our or-><lb/>
chard &amp;<lb/>
lawn will<lb/>
not be<lb/>
destroyed.<lb/>
<dateline>
Monday Evening,<lb/>

<salute>My precious wifie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I got your<lb/>
darling letter written Satur-<lb/>
day afternoon when I reached<lb/>
my office, this morning, and I don't<lb/>
know when I ever had any thing<lb/>
to give me more distress than your<lb/>
account of those dreadful locusts.<lb/>
My first impulse was to go right<lb/>
up, this afternoon, and try to as-<lb/>
sist you in some way in keeping<lb/>
our trees from destruction! but<lb/>
as I thought over it, I concluded<lb/>
that I had better go to the Agri-<lb/>
cultural Dep't, &amp; see if I could<lb/>
find out any thing that would<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02624002"/>
be of assistance or comfort to<lb/>
us- I went over, therefore, and had<lb/>
a long talk with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marlatt, the<lb/>
expert on this subject, and put all<lb/>
the facts before him about my<lb/>
trees- He says that we need not<lb/>
worry so much, as he can assure<lb/>
us that <hi>not</hi> one of our <hi>older</hi><lb/>
trees will be killed by the locusts-<lb/>
He says that while they will be<lb/>
badly stung, that the only damage<lb/>
will be the loss of last year's<lb/>
growth- He doubts whether many<lb/>
of our young trees will be killed --<lb/>
perhaps here &amp; there one or<lb/>
two- What was of particular<lb/>
interest to me, he showed<lb/>
me a row of apple trees, about<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02624003"/>
the size of my larger trees, which<lb/>
he has purposely cut off about<lb/>
3 feet from the ground, <hi>remov-<lb/>
ing the whole top</hi>, as an exper-<lb/>
iment, each year for the last<lb/>
three years, and which now look<lb/>
perfectly beautiful- Pear trees<lb/>
treated the same way are very<lb/>
luxuriant- He says that if our<lb/>
trees are stung so badly that they<lb/>
would lose every branch (which<lb/>
he has never known) we would<lb/>
only need to severely prune them<lb/>
this fall, &amp; they would soon<lb/>
regain their size- He told me<lb/>
to assure you that your fears<lb/>
were greatly exaggerated &amp; that<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02624004"/>
we will <add>not</add> lose our orchard -- so<lb/>
precious heart, I feel greatly en-<lb/>
couraged- M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marlatt says that<lb/>
we must not keep our trees<lb/>
wrapped up too long in muslin<lb/>
as when removed the sun might<lb/>
scald the leaves badly- Leave<lb/>
it on, however, until I come up-<lb/>
I hope to come by Friday or Satur-<lb/>
day &amp; think that I will then come<lb/>
for 15 days- What a glorious<lb/>
rain we have been &amp; are now<lb/>
having- It is simply delightful-<lb/>
Yesterday was intolerably hot<lb/>
here- Save me some strawberries-<lb/>
Borden tells me that Senator Warren<lb/>
told him on Saturday that <add>the</add> President<lb/>
had spoken in the highest terms to him con-<lb/>
cerning my work in Cuba- Don't be discouraged<lb/>
Bless my sweet babies hearts-</p>
