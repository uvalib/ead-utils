<p>11&sol;2&sol;31 Talk for XIX<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Century Club p.1</p>
<p>On the day of his return from Peru (where, as Sanitary Advisor of<lb/>
the Peruvian Government, he had just stamped out an epidemic of yellow<lb/>
fever in the northern part of that country) Father was asked, by the Rocke-<lb/>
feller Foundation to write a history of yellow fever. His health was much<lb/>
broken and he replied that he would almost certainly die before the completion<lb/>
of such a work Realizing its importance, however, he added that if he found<lb/>
he could plan the book in sections. &ldquo;like a flight of steps,&rdquo; each subdivision<lb/>
being <add>a</add> complete <del>in itself</del><add>entity, though correlated with <del><unclear>what</unclear></del>the others</add> so that whoever came after him could go on from<lb/>
where he left off<unclear>,</unclear> he would undertake the work. He was able to s<del>p</del><add>o</add> plan<lb/>
the book and began work shortly thereafter (early in 1922). After several<lb/>
severe attacks of angina, the following summer, he realized that he would<lb/>
have even less time to give to the work than he had anticipated. He there-<lb/>
fore devoted all his efforts to finishing during his lifetime a section<lb/>
which should be complete in itself--the early history of yellow fever. That<lb/>
is the book which here presented to you. Even this was completed only by<lb/>
working throughout long illnesses, the last year of his life <del>he was</del> <add>being <unclear>2</unclear></add> con-<lb/>
tinuously confined to his bed. Yet knowing that any of the frequent inter-<lb/>
ruptions to his work might be the <unclear><del>final</del></unclear><add>last</add> one, in constant discomfort, in al-<lb/>
most constant pain his energy and enthusiamm were unabated and he worked on,<lb/>
dictating towards the <del>last</del><add>end</add> (when too weak to write) until within five hours<lb/>
of the beginning of his last illness. And he had the final satisfaction of<lb/>
knowing that h<del>s</del><add>i</add>s race against time was won! By a narrow margin, it is true,<lb/>
and with some legacies of further work to others, before the book, <hi>as he had<lb/>
planned it</hi> could be given to the world. However, that part of the work which<lb/>
no one but he could have done he did! It was signifi<del>g</del><add>c</add>ant of the spirit <del>of</del><lb/>
in which the book was written and of the appreciat<del>e</del>ion of the fact by others,<lb/>
that when the news of his last illness became known, out of the stream of<lb/>
messages that poured in from his <hi>confr&egrave;res</hi> in all parts of the world, all<lb/>
sent congratulations that he had reached his go<del>ae</del><add>ll</add>! <unclear><add>There was not</add></unclear> Not one man sent a<lb/>
<add>one message of condolence!</add><lb/>
message of <del>concdo</del><add>condolence!</add></p>
