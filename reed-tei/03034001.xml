Messrs. Hagood, Rivers &amp; Young,<lb/>
Charleston, S. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sirs:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>In response to your request I visited the<lb/>
Little Salkehatchie Swamp on Sept. 8th, leaving Charleston<lb/>
by automobile at six o'clock A.M. and arriving at Walter-<lb/>
boro, a distance of about fifty-five miles, at eleven-<lb/>
thirty, the long trip being due to an accident on the<lb/>
road. From Walterboro I proceeded to the swamp in company<lb/>
with Messrs. Frank and Hayne, and Dr. Cain of Charleston.<lb/>
We spent about three hours at the swamp inspecting the<lb/>
localities where cutting was in progress, others which had<lb/>
been the sites of former cutting, and others again which<lb/>
had never been cut. Dippings were made by Mr. Hayne at<lb/>
a number of places in order to ascertain, if possible,<lb/>
whether anopheles larvae were equally abundant in these<lb/>
various localities.</p>
<p>The question to be answered, as I understand,<lb/>
is whether or not the cutting of timber in the swamp could<lb/>
have the effect of producing an increase in the prevalence<lb/>
of malaria in the neighborhood adjacent. Inasmuch as<lb/>
malaria is conveyed exclusively by mosquitoes of the<lb/>
anopheles family, this question resolves itself into the<lb/>
effect which the cutting of timber might have upon the<lb/>
anopheles mosquitoes.</p>
<p>It is possible for felled timber to obstruct the<lb/>
flow of water in such a way as to lead to the formation<lb/>
of pools and so increase the number of breeding places.<lb/>
Whether this condition really was produced is a matter<lb/>
for observation to determine, and my inspection failed to<lb/>

show that such an increase in breeding places actually<lb/>
occurred. Furthermore, the opening up of the cut areas<lb/>
to the freer action of air and sunshie would tend to<lb/>
increase evaporation, and hasten the drying up of shallow<lb/>
pools.</p>
<p>If the cutting brought about an increase in the<lb/>
prevalence of malaria, we ought to find anopheles larvae<lb/>
in greater abundance where the cutting was done. The<lb/>
dippings made at the time of my visit, however, did not<lb/>
show a large number of larvae anywhere, and there was<lb/>
practically no difference in the numbers found in the<lb/>
various localities examined. The conditions observed<lb/>
generally near the houses in which malaria is said to<lb/>
have been reported suggested that the breeding places might<lb/>
be abundant in the immediate neighborhood of such houses,<lb/>
and a careful survey should be made with the view of<lb/>
determining if this be the case. It is significant and<lb/>
suggestive that anopheles larvae were found in a branch<lb/>
quite near the house of Mr. Allen Padgett in which I was<lb/>
told several cases had developed.</p>
