<p>FEVER CASES CONCEALED.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Former Cuban Administration Ac-<lb/>
cused by Gen. Wood of Covering<lb/>
Up Facts.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch to The Evening Post.]</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, October 23.--Gen. Wood has<lb/>
been questioned on all sides about the yel-<lb/>
low-fever epidemic in Havana. The figures<lb/>
for September of this year appear to ex-<lb/>
ceed the figures of either 1898 or 1899, and<lb/>
the inference is drawn from this that the<lb/>
fever has done more damage and is making<lb/>
a worse spread now than heretofore. Gen.<lb/>
Wood denies this. He says that the assump-<lb/>
tion is founded on the mistaken idea that<lb/>
the statistics were given out last year as<lb/>
freely as they are this year. They are now<lb/>
given to all the papers daily as freely as<lb/>
any other news; indeed, it is the effort of<lb/>
the existing Government in Cuba to keep<lb/>
the public informed candidly on all subjects<lb/>
in which it takes a legitimate interest.</p>
<p>The inference from Gen. Wood's words<lb/>
bears rather severely upon the regime of<lb/>
Gen. Brooke. As Governor-General, Gen.<lb/>
Brooke was never particularly fond of giv-<lb/>
ing information to the press, but this is the<lb/>
first intimation made in any authoritative<lb/>
quarter that he made a practice of con-<lb/>
cealing sanitary statistics.</p>
<p>Gen. Wood says further that the idea that<lb/>
Havana was well cleaned up a year ago is<lb/>
an error.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>The New York <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> of this morning prints<lb/>
in a dispatch from Washington an interview<lb/>
with Gen. Wood. In the course of his re-<lb/>
marks, as reported, he specifically accuses<lb/>
the Administration of last year of giving<lb/>
out false returns in regard to the number<lb/>
of cases of yellow fever. He is reported as<lb/>
saying:</p>
<p>There is nothing new in the yellow-fever<lb/>
epidemic. It is not as large as last year, but<lb/>
the difference is that the number of cases<lb/>
were kept secret last December, while now<lb/>
the figures are open to the public. Havana's<lb/>
yellow-fever record last December and Jan-<lb/>
uary was the largest in ten years, but it was<lb/>
concealed. Now every one knows all about<lb/>
the number of cases.</p>
<p>The fact is worthy of note that on the 20th<lb/>
of last December Gen. Wood himself took<lb/>
charge of the government of Cuba; and he<lb/>
must therefore have given out the figures<lb/>
for last December and January.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>KENTUCKY AGAIN DELAYED.</p>
<p>make things easy for him.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Eve Post, 1<unclear>0.</unclear> 26.00</p>
<p>We have already referred to President<lb/>
Eliot's accusation that the Administra-<lb/>
tion keeps the people ignorant of facts<lb/>
which they have a right to know. This<lb/>
policy of concealment is again evident<lb/>
in Cuba. A few days ago word came<lb/>
from the most trustworthy sources that<lb/>
the yellow fever epidemic at Havana is<lb/>
more severe than for a number of years.<lb/>
When Gov. Wood, glad in the thought<lb/>
that he was spreading health and happi-<lb/>
ness through a hitherto misgoverned isl-<lb/>
and, arrived in New York, he tried to<lb/>
minimize the effect of the fever news by<lb/>
saying that the death rate in Havana, in-<lb/>
cluding yellow fever, is smaller than for<lb/>
many years. Later, when the Washing-<lb/>
ton correspondent of the New York <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi><lb/>
pressed him for an explanation, he is re-<lb/>
ported to have said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing new in the yellow-<lb/>
fever epidemic. It is not as large as last<lb/>
year, but the difference is that the number<lb/>
of cases was kept secret last December,<lb/>
while now the figures are open to the pub-<lb/>
lic. Havana's yellow-fever record last De-<lb/>
cember and January was the largest in<lb/>
ten years, but it was concealed. Now every<lb/>
one knows all about the number of cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This admission of concealment had such<lb/>
an unpleasant effect that Gov. Wood has-<lb/>
tened last Wednesday, in an interview<lb/>
with the correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Evening<lb/>
Post</hi>, to explain the matter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had never intended to intimate that<lb/>
there had been an attempt to deceive the<lb/>
public, but probably the subject had been<lb/>
passed over, with the assent of the press<lb/>
representatives, on account of the panicky<lb/>
conditions of public feeling in the United<lb/>
States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distinction here is a subtle one--too<lb/>
subtle for the crude intelligence of the<lb/>
general public to grasp. There was, it<lb/>
seems, neither concealment nor deceit,<lb/>
but in order to prevent &ldquo;panicky condi-<lb/>
tions&rdquo;--in short, in order to spread the<lb/>
delusion that the administration of affairs<lb/>
in Cuba was brilliantly successful--facts<lb/>
were &ldquo;passed over.&rdquo; And now comes Gen.<lb/>
Brooke--whom Gov. Wood succeeded on<lb/>
December 20, 1899--with the blunt decla-<lb/>
ration:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every [yellow fever] case was reported<lb/>
immediately, and was made public at least<lb/>
at the end of every month. Gen. Ludlow, as<lb/>
Military Governor of Havana, was more di-<lb/>
rectly connected with the matter than I. To<lb/>
the best of my knowledge there was no con-<lb/>
cealment, and fortunately very little yellow<lb/>
fever. The small number of cases caused<lb/>
the Cubans to believe that the Americans<lb/>
would put an end to yellow fever in Cuba.&rdquo;<lb/>
At the moment there is a direct question<lb/>
of veracity between Gen. Ludlow and<lb/>
Gov. Wood. But even when that matter<lb/>
is settled, we are compelled to believe<lb/>
that important facts are &ldquo;passed over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>----------</p>
<p>DEFENDING HIS RECORD.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Gen. Ludlow on the Failure to Publish<lb/>
Yellow-Fever Reports.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch to The Evening Post.]</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, October 26.--Gen. Ludlow,<lb/>
who, as Governor of Havana, was directly<lb/>
responsible for the publicity or non-publici-<lb/>
ty of vital statistics of that city down to<lb/>
about six months ago, after reading Gen.<lb/>
Wood's recent interviews, said to your cor-<lb/>
respondent this morning that there had nev-<lb/>
er been any suppression or concealment of<lb/>
last year's figures. He said:</p>
<p>The fullest measure of publicity was giv-<lb/>
en to all sanitary data during my adminis-<lb/>
tration and the reports day by day were<lb/>
accessible to the press both in the depart-<lb/>
ment headquarters and in the office of the<lb/>
chief sanitary officer. In addition, every<lb/>
month a tabulated statement was printed<lb/>
and widely distributed, giving the complete<lb/>
health statistics and sanitary data of the<lb/>
preceding month. The press could use this<lb/>
information at will. If it did not, it was for<lb/>
some other reason than inability to procure<lb/>
it. Possibly the official printing of the data<lb/>
deprived them of the character of news.</p>
<p>The General added that there could have<lb/>
been no motive for concealing or even ig-<lb/>
noring these statistics, since the officers<lb/>
concerned were proud of the good showing<lb/>
they made.</p>
