<cell>WALTER REED.<lb/><lb/>
Life of the Man Who Showed the Re-<lb/>
lation of Mosquitos to Yellow Fever.<lb/><lb/>
AMONG matters of vital interest<lb/>
to Americans, few have counted<lb/>
for more in the past generation<lb/>
than the conviction of the mos-<lb/>
quito as the agent of the spread<lb/>
of yellow fever. How that con-<lb/>
viction was brought about and the story<lb/>
of the man who had the greatest part in<lb/>
bringing it about is set forth in the vol-<lb/>
ume entitled &ldquo;Walter Reed and Yellow<lb/>
Fever,&rdquo; (McClure, Phillips &amp; Co.,) the<lb/>
author of which is Howard A. Kelly,<lb/>
professor of gynecological surgery in<lb/>
Johns Hopkins University. The life of<lb/>
Major Reed, like the lives of most men<lb/>
who have done great things, offers much<lb/>
to the biographer who can and will tell<lb/>
the story of the things done, and the<lb/>
history of the ravages of yellow fever in<lb/>
this country, and of the final conquest<lb/>
of the scourge as the result of the ex-<lb/>
periments made under Reed's direction,<lb/>
is something which it is quite worth<lb/>
while having in compact form. Espe-<lb/>
cially as there still remain persons who<lb/>
assume to pooh-pooh the very notion of<lb/>
the responsibility of the wretched insect.<lb/>
Dr. Kelly has made a very thorough<lb/>
study of his subject, he exhibits profes-<lb/>
sional accuracy, and is inspired not only<lb/>
with professional enthusiasm, but with<lb/>
a strong desire to rescue from neglect<lb/>
the name of a public benefactor whose<lb/>
fame has not squared with his deserts.<lb/>
Therefore the--book is both interesting<lb/>
and valuable--the more so as the author<lb/>
has had full access to Major Reed's<lb/>
papers and is able to publish letters which<lb/>
reveal not only the stages of the work,<lb/>
but the man. The man, if one may judge<lb/>
from what is said of him by his asso-<lb/>
ciates in the Service, was both big and<lb/>
lovable.The letters speak for his sin-<lb/>
cerity and simplicity. As for his faith-<lb/>
fulness and ability, his work speaks for<lb/>
that eloquently enough.<lb/><lb/>
Walter Reed was born of a good North<lb/>
Carolina family in Gloucester County, Va.<lb/>
in 1851, his father being a minister of the<lb/>
Methodist Church. As a boy, during the<lb/>
civil war and before, he attended school<lb/>
in the town of Farmville, in the State of<lb/>
his birth, and at 16 went to the Universi-<lb/>
ty of Virginia. There he spent one year<lb/>
in academic studies, and then one year in<lb/>
the medical school, taking his degree at<lb/>
the astonishingly precocious age of 17<lb/>
years. From the university he came to<lb/>
New York, to Bellevue Hospital, where,<lb/>
in another year, he received another de-<lb/>
gree of M. D. After that date (1869) he<lb/>
served in various hospitals in New York<lb/>
and Brooklyn, became Inspector for the<lb/>
Board of Health in the later city, and<lb/>
acquired no little experience and local<lb/>
reputation. Then he took examinations for<lb/>
the United States Medical Service, and<lb/>
was appointed at the age of 25 (1875)<lb/>
Assistant Surgeon, United States Army,<lb/>
with the rank of First Lieutenant. In<lb/>
1876 he married Miss Emilie Lawrence<lb/>
of Murfreesboro, N. C., and went West<lb/>
to serve at a remote Arizona army<lb/>
post, called Fort Lowen. Dr. and Mrs.<lb/>
Reed traveled from San Francisco (twen-<lb/>
ty-two days'journey) in an ambulance,<lb/>
and his letters provide a graphic descrip-<lb/>
tion of the journey. In 1877 Reed was<lb/>
transferred to Fort Apache, and the jour-<lb/>
ney of eleven days was performed in the<lb/>
same fashion--the only fashion available<lb/>
indeed.<lb/><lb/>
Dr. Reed continued there till 1881,<lb/>
when he was ordered to Fort McHenry,<lb/>
Baltimore. In 1882 he was sent to<lb/>
Nebraska, where he served five years.<lb/>
The next assignment (1887) was Mount<lb/>
Vernon Barracks, Alabama, and the<lb/>
next (1889) to Baltimore, where he<lb/>
managed to get permission to pur-<lb/>
sue at Johns Hopkins University the<lb/>
studies in bacteriology which led to his<lb/>
yellow fever work. It is not possible to<lb/>
go closely into this period, but in 1898 he<lb/>
was Curator of the Army Medical Mu-<lb/>
seum in Washington and professor of bac-<lb/>
teriology and clinical microscopy in the<lb/>
United Stats Army Medical School.<lb/>
Eager to serve with the troops in Cuba,<lb/>
says Dr. Kelly, &ldquo;he and other army sur-<lb/>
geons were relegated to unimportant po-<lb/>
sitions, while men with political influence<lb/>
were preferred.&rdquo; As a result &ldquo;the army<lb/>
medical corps received a black eye be-<lb/>
cause of the neglect and incompetence of<lb/>
men who did not really belong to it.&rdquo;<lb/><lb/>
At this point Dr. Kelly turns aside<lb/>
to give an account of the ravages<lb/>
of yellow fever, especially the epidemics<lb/>
in Philadelphia in 1793, in New Orleans<lb/>
in 1853, and in Memphis in 1878, and to<lb/>
trace the various medical theories as to<lb/>
the nature of the disease and the manner<lb/>
of its propagation. The prevailing notion<lb/>
ten years ago was that it was conveyed<lb/>
in clothing and the like. Dr. Kelly then<lb/>
describes the work of Sir Patrick Manson<lb/>
and others in the case of misquitos and<lb/>
malaria and so leads up to the theory of<lb/>
Dr. Carlos I. Finlay--a theory which Dr.<lb/>
</cell>
<cell>Finlay held but could not prove for many<lb/>
years--that mosquitos were responsible<lb/>
for the spreading of yellow fever also.<lb/>
In 1900 yellow fever appeared among<lb/>
the American troops stationed at Ha-<lb/>
vana, and a commission was appointed<lb/>
to study the disease and its method of<lb/>
propagation. Dr. Walter Reed was the<lb/>
head of this commission, his associates<lb/>
Dr. James Carroll, Dr. Jesse W. Lazear,<lb/>
and Dr. Aristides Agramonte. All four<lb/>
of them were in Cuba in that and the<lb/>
following year, and most readers of the<lb/>
daily newspapers will remember some-<lb/>
thing about the nature of the experi-<lb/>
ments, which presently resolved them-<lb/>
selves into two heads, (1) experiments<lb/>
with mosquitos which had bitten fever<lb/>
patients and were allowed to bite well<lb/>
persons, (volunteers, of course;) (2) ex-<lb/>
periments with infected clothing which<lb/>
well persons (likewise volunteers) actual-<lb/>
ly slept in in a close room night after<lb/>
night. Nobody caught the fever from the<lb/>
clothing, a large number of those who<lb/>
were bitten by the infected mosquitos<lb/>
did take the fever. Dr. Carroll was<lb/>
the first of these. Dr. Lazear, who was<lb/>
bitten by accident, died of the disease.<lb/>
The more formal and conclusive tests<lb/>
were made at a carefully isolated experi-<lb/>
ment station called Camp Lazear, a mile<lb/>
from the Town of Quemados, Cuba, and<lb/>
the account here given of these tests is<lb/>
extremely clear and interesting, though<lb/>
the details are not always quite pleasant<lb/>
reading, and the scientific enthusiasm of<lb/>
the doctors when a poor chap who'd been<lb/>
bitten really got the fever sounds a bit<lb/>
ghoullsh. Thus Dr. Reed writes to his<lb/>
wife: &ldquo;It is with a great deal of pleasure<lb/>
that I hasten to tell you that we have<lb/>
succeeded in producing a case of un-<lb/>
mistakable yellow fever by the bite of<lb/>
the mosquito.&rdquo; And again:<lb/><lb/>
Dec. 21, 1900. fifteen mosquitos were<lb/>
freed in &ldquo;the infected mosquito build-<lb/>
ing.&rdquo; At noon on the same day, five<lb/>
minutes after the mosquitos had been<lb/>
placed therein, a plucky Ohio boy, Moran<lb/>
by name, clad only in his nightshirt and<lb/>
fresh from a bath, entered the room con-<lb/>
taining the mosquitos. Seven in all bit<lb/>
him. At 4:30 he entered again and this<lb/>
time five others bit him. On Christmas<lb/>
morning this brave lad was stricken with<lb/>
yellow fever.<lb/><lb/>
Fortunately the &ldquo;brave lad&rdquo; got well<lb/>
again--as, indeed, did most of the ex-<lb/>
perimental volunteers who contracted the<lb/>
disease.<lb/><lb/>
The remainder of Dr. Reed's life was<lb/>
spent in Washington in routine Govern-<lb/>
ment service. He was a surgeon with the<lb/>
rank of Major when he went to Cuba,<lb/>
and he was still Major in spite of his<lb/>
services when he died of appendicitis in<lb/>
1902. Harvard had, to be sure, given him<lb/>
the degree of A. M., and his epitaph in<lb/>
Arlington has the inscription: &ldquo;He gave<lb/>
man control over that dreadful scourge,<lb/>
yellow fever.&rdquo;<lb/><lb/>
How complete that control is and how<lb/>
mortal the scourge had been in shown by<lb/>
the remaining chapters of Dr. Kelly's<lb/>
work, which contrast admirably condi-<lb/>
tions and methods and mortalities in<lb/>
the Philadelphia epidemic of 1793, the<lb/>
Memphis epidemic of 1878, and the recent<lb/>
outbreaks of the fever in New Orleans<lb/>
and Laredo, Texas. A chapter is devoted<lb/>
to the other members of the Yellow<lb/>
Fever Commission of 1900 and their work<lb/>
separately considered.
