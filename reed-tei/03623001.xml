<salute>Dear Doctor:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You will hang me, I am sure, just as soon as you can lay<lb/>
hands on me. For the photographs, I have had all kinds of &ldquo;contra-<lb/>
tiempos&rdquo;. I had to make two extra trips to have the photos taken,<lb/>
having been caught in the rain twice. At that, they are not extra<lb/>
good anyway, but hope they will serve your purpose.</p>
<p>Miss Rojas just called me on the phone to inform me that<lb/>
she had some startling news for me. She said she found some contracts<lb/>
covering the occupation of part of the &ldquo;Finca San Jos&eacute;&rdquo; for Camp Lazear.<lb/>
Am going to hot foot it out to the &ldquo;Quinta San Jos&eacute;&rdquo; just as soon as<lb/>
I get a bite of lunch. The Rojas family have been summering at the<lb/>
&ldquo;Quinta&rdquo; for some months. Will let you know by tomorrow's airmail<lb/>
what the evidence and dope is. I pray and hope it will lead to some-<lb/>
thing conclusive. I also hope it will upset most of our calculations<lb/>
for I am not at all sure of mine and have but little confidence in the<lb/>
calculations (joint) of Do&ntilde;a Maria Teresa Loma Viuda de Rojas and MY<lb/>
OWN SELF. The place is excavated so badly and honeycombed from so<lb/>
many directions, in addition to the number of houses that have been<lb/>
built on the property, that the good se&ntilde;ora herself failed to recognize<lb/>
very much of it, which is all natural enough.</p>
<p>I shall mail to you today all the photographs I have, unless<lb/>
the new discovery changes everything, but you will have to wait some<lb/>
days yet for criticism on your memorandum and other questions (they seem<lb/>
like a million) asked for in your letters and various notes. So, please<lb/>
keep your shirt on in the meantime and bear in mind that I am devoting<lb/>
as much time as possible to the work you mapped out for me and which<lb/>
you were rather late in mailing. By this I do not mean to criticize<lb/>
the delay between date of your letter and date same was actually mailed.<lb/>
I mention it so that you may not get sore at me and think I have fallen<lb/>
down on the job, leaving you in the lurch.</p>
<p>I am now FORCED to make it to Washington &amp; Jefferson, so<lb/>
will be there alright with my little better half. Will have to find<lb/>
out what date it will suit Virginia to have me stop there for a minute<lb/>
- before or after my return from <unclear>W&amp;J</unclear>, but I will have to make both<lb/>
institutions. Elida joins me in very kindest remembrances to Mrs.<lb/>
Hench and your your very good self. YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM ME<lb/>
AGAIN TOMORROW.</p>
