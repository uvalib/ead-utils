<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>The results of the work of Maj. Walter Reed, Medical Corps,<lb/>
United States Army, and the Yellow Fever Commission, of which he<lb/>
was president and the masterful mind, have been so beneficial and<lb/>
far-reaching that its importance is considered secondary to no other<lb/>
scientific achievement.</p>
<p>The various publications in regard to Maj. Reed and his work and<lb/>
the reports of the commission, as well as other reports on subjects<lb/>
intimately connected with this work, while all extant and on file in<lb/>
the larger libraries of this country, are not available for the profes-<lb/>
sion in general. Being bound in one volume they will be much more<lb/>
available for general use, and will be less liable to be misplaced.</p>
<p>Many of the younger men in the profession and in the Medical<lb/>
Corps of the Army are not so thoroughly conversant with the various<lb/>
steps of this work as is thought desirable. This work should be a<lb/>
source of inspiration for every medical officer.</p>
<p>In compiling these various publications repetitions have been<lb/>
avoided as much as possible. However, the reports of Maj. Reed<lb/>
and his associates are considered of so much scientific as well as his-<lb/>
torical interest that they are published in full in chronological order.<lb/>
In this way the various steps in the experiments are more clearly<lb/>
shown.</p>

<head>WALTER REED.--A MEMOIR.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></head>
<byline>By <docAuthor>WALTER D. MCCAW</docAuthor>, Major, Medical Corps, United States Army.</byline>
<p>It is given to but few scientific men to lay bare a secret of nature<lb/>
materially affecting the prosperity of nations, and the lives, fortunes,<lb/>
and happiness of thousands. Fewer still succeed in so quickly con-<lb/>
vincing brother scientists and men in authority of the truth of their<lb/>
discoveries that their own eyes behold the glorious result of their<lb/>
labor.</p>
<p>Of the 51 years of Walter Reed's industrious, blameless life, 12<lb/>
only were spent in the study of the special branch of science in which<lb/>
he became famous, but his name now stands with those of Jenner,<lb/>
Lister, and Morton as among the benefactors of humanity.</p>
<p>Walter Reed was born in Gloucester County, Va., September 13,<lb/>
1851, the son of the Rev. Lemuel Sutton Reed and Pharaba White,<lb/>
his wife.</p>
<p>The circumstances of his family were modest, and some of the<lb/>
years of his boyhood were spent in a much troubled section of the<lb/>
south during the great Civil War. He acquired, however, a good<lb/>
preliminary education, and at an age when most boys are still in<lb/>
the schoolroom he began the study of medicine at the University of<lb/>
Virginia, graduating as M. D. in 1869, when only 17 years old.</p>
<p>A second medical degree was received later from Bellevue Medical<lb/>
College, New York, and then came terms of service in the Brooklyn<lb/>
City Hospital, and the City Hospital, Blackwell's Island.</p>
<p>Before the age of 21 Reed was a district physician in New York<lb/>
City, and at 22 one of the five inspectors of the board of health of<lb/>
Brooklyn.</p>
<p>He entered the Army of the United States as assistant surgeon<lb/>
with the rank of first lieutenant, in 1875, and for the next 18 years,<lb/>
with the usual varying fortunes of a young medical officer of the<lb/>
Army, he served in Arizona, Nebraska, Dakota, and in the Southern<lb/>
and Eastern States.</p>
<p>According to the exigencies of the service he was moved frequently<lb/>
from station to station, everywhere recognized by men of his own<lb/>
age as a charming and sympathetic companion, and by older officers</p>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>as an earnest and intelligent physician, whose industry, fidelity to<lb/>
duty, and singularly clear judgment, gave brilliant promise for the<lb/>
future. In the poor cabins and dugouts of the pioneers in the<lb/>
sparsely settled districts where he served his flag, Reed was ever a<lb/>
messenger of healing and comfort. At that time Army posts on the<lb/>
frontier were usually remote and with small garrisons. The young<lb/>
medical officer, generally the only one at the station, was called upon<lb/>
by the settlers for miles around. Without help, and with only such<lb/>
instruments and medicines as could be hastily stuffed in his saddlebag,<lb/>
he was summoned to attend a fractured thigh, a child choking with<lb/>
diphtheria, or, most trying of all, a complicated childbirth.</p>
<p>Such experience schools well in self-reliance, and in the formation<lb/>
of quick and accurate observation.</p>
<p>For a man like Reed, already an earnest student, no better prepara-<lb/>
tion could perhaps have been had. His earlier Army service must<lb/>
have singularly tended to develop in him the very qualities most<lb/>
necessary to his final success. To the end of his life it was noticeable<lb/>
that even when he had long given up the practice of medicine for the<lb/>
work of the laboratory, he was nevertheless unexcelled at the bedside<lb/>
for rapid, unerring diagnosis and sound judgment in treatment. So<lb/>
also were the series of experiments which robbed yellow fever of its<lb/>
terrors especially <hi>remarkable for simplicity, accuracy, and complete-<lb/>
ness, or they never would have so quickly convinced the world of<lb/>
their truth</hi>. Too much reverence for accepted teachings, and too<lb/>
little experience in grappling with difficulties unassisted, and they<lb/>
might never have been conceived or carried out.</p>
<p>In 1890 he was assigned to duty in Baltimore and remained there<lb/>
over a year. Here he had the great advantage of working in the<lb/>
laboratories of Johns Hopkins University and the happiness of win-<lb/>
ning the close friendship of his distinguished teacher, Prof. William<lb/>
H. Welch.</p>
<p>In 1893, Reed was promoted surgeon with the rank of major,<lb/>
and in the same year was detailed in Washington as curator of the<lb/>
Army Medical Museum and professor of bacteriology at the newly<lb/>
organized Army Medical School. Here he worked industriously at<lb/>
his specialty and <hi>wrote many valuable monographs</hi>, all charac-<lb/>
terized by accuracy and originality. His excellent judgment made<lb/>
him especially valuable in investigating the causes of epidemic dis-<lb/>
eases at military posts, and in making sanitary inspections. He<lb/>
was, therefore, frequently selected for such work, which with his<lb/>
duties as teacher and member of examining boards, occupied much<lb/>
of the time that he would otherwise have spent in his laboratory.<lb/>
Here again it seems that duties which must often have been irksome<lb/>
were specially fitting him for his culminating work.</p>
<p>During the Spanish-American war the camps of the volunteer<lb/>
troops in the United States were devastated by typhoid fever, and<lb/>
<hi>Maj. Reed was selected as the head of a board to study</hi> the causation<lb/>
and spread of the disease. This immense task occupied more than<lb/>
a year's time. With the utmost patience and accuracy the details<lb/>
of hundreds of individual cases were grouped and studied. The<lb/>
<hi>report of the commission, now in course of publication by</hi> the Gov-<lb/>
ernment, is a monumental work which must always serve as a basis<lb/>
for future study of the epidemiology of typhoid fever.</p>
<pb n="9" id="S8220015"/>
<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
9</p>
<p>The <hi>most original and valuable</hi> work of the board is the proof<lb/>
that the infection of <hi>typhoid fever is spread in camps by the com-<lb/>
mon fly</hi>, and by contact with patients and infected articles, clothing,<lb/>
tentage, and utensils, as well as by contaminated drinking water.</p>
<p>In June, 1900, Maj. Reed was sent to Cuba as president of a board<lb/>
to study the infectious diseases of the country, but more especially<lb/>
yellow fever. Associated with him were Acting Asst. Surgs. James<lb/>
Carroll, Jesse W. Lazear, and A. Agramonte.</p>
<p>At this time the American authorities in Cuba had <hi>for a year and<lb/>
a half endeavored to diminish</hi> the disease and mortality of the Cuban<lb/>
towns, by general sanitary work, but while the health of the popu-<lb/>
lation showed distinct improvement and the mortality had greatly<lb/>
diminished, yellow fever apparently had been entirely unaffected by<lb/>
these measures. In fact, <hi>owing to the large number of nonimmune<lb/>
foreigners, the disease was more frequent than usual in Habana and<lb/>
in Quemados near the camp of American troops</hi>, and many valuable<lb/>
lives of American officers and soldiers had been lost.</p>
<p>Reed was convinced from the first that general sanitary measures<lb/>
alone would not check the disease but that its transmission was prob-<lb/>
ably due to an insect.</p>
<p>The fact that malarial fever, caused by an animal parasite in the<lb/>
blood, is transmitted from man to man through the agency of certain<lb/>
mosquitoes had been recently accepted by the scientific world; also<lb/>
<hi>several years before Dr.</hi> Carlos Finlay, of Habana, had advanced the<lb/>
theory that a mosquito conveyed the unknown cause of yellow fever,<lb/>
but did not succeed in demonstrating the truth of his theory.</p>
<p><hi>Dr. H. R. Carter, of the Marine-Hospital</hi> Service, had written a<lb/>
paper showing that although the period of incubation of yellow fever<lb/>
was only 5 days, yet a house to which a patient was carried did<lb/>
not become infected for from 15 to 20 days.</p>
<p>To Reed's mind this indicated that the unknown infective agent<lb/>
has to undergo a period of incubation of from 10 to 15 days, and<lb/>
probably in the body of a biting insect.</p>
<p>Up to this time the most generally accepted theory as to the causa-<lb/>
tion of yellow fever was that of Sanarelli, who claimed that the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> discovered by him was the specific agent of the<lb/>
disease. Maj. Reed in association with Dr. Carroll had, however,<lb/>
already demonstrated that this bacillus was one widely disseminated<lb/>
in the United States, and bore no special relation to yellow fever.</p>
<p><hi>In June, July, and August, 1900, the commission gave their entire<lb/>
attention to</hi> the bacteriological study of the blood of yellow-fever<lb/>
patients and the post-mortem examinations of the organs of those<lb/>
dying with the disease. In 24 cases where the blood was repeatedly<lb/>
examined, as well as in 11 carefully studied autopsies, <hi rend="italic">Bacillus<lb/>
icteroides</hi> was not discovered, nor was there any indication of the<lb/>
presence in the blood of a specific cause of the disease.</p>
<p>Application was made to Gen. Leonard Wood, the military governor<lb/>
of Cuba, for permission to conduct experiments on nonimmune<lb/>
persons, and a liberal sum of money requested for the purpose of<lb/>
rewarding volunteers who would submit themselves to experiment.</p>
<p>It was indeed fortunate that the military governor of Cuba was a<lb/>
man who by his breadth of mind and special scientific training could<lb/>
readily appreciate the arguments of Maj. Reed as to the value of the<lb/>
proposed work.</p>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>Money and full authority to proceed were promptly granted, and to<lb/>
the everlasting glory of the American soldier, volunteers from the<lb/>
Army offered themselves for experiment in plenty and with the utmost<lb/>
fearlessness.</p>
<p><hi>Before the arrangements were entirely completed</hi>, Dr. Carroll, a<lb/>
member of the commission, allowed himself to be bitten by a mosquito<lb/>
that 12 days previously had filled itself with the blood of a yellow-<lb/>
fever patient. He suffered from a very severe attack, and his was<lb/>
the first experimental case. <hi>Dr. Lazear also experimented on himself<lb/>
at the same time, but was not infected</hi>. Some days later, while in<lb/>
the yellow-fever ward, he was bitten by a mosquito and noted the<lb/>
fact carefully. He acquired the disease in its most terrible form and<lb/>
died a martyr to science and a true hero.</p>
<p>No other fatality occurred among the brave men who, in the course<lb/>
of the experiments, willingly exposed themselves to the infection of<lb/>
the dreaded disease.</p>
<p>A camp was especially constructed for the experiments <hi>about 4</hi><lb/>
miles from Habana, christened Camp Lazear in honor of the dead<lb/>
comrade. The inmates of the camp were put into most rigid quar-<lb/>
antine and ample time was allowed to eliminate any possibility of<lb/>
the disease being brought in from Habana.</p>
<p><hi>The personnel consisted of three nurses and nine nonimmunes, all<lb/>
in the military service, and included two physicians</hi>.</p>
<p>From time to time Spanish immigrants, newly arrived, were<lb/>
brought in directly from the immigrant station; a person not known<lb/>
to be <hi>immune</hi> was not allowed to leave camp, or if he did was for-<lb/>
bidden to return.</p>
<p>The most complete record was kept of the health of every man to<lb/>
be experimented upon, thus eliminating the possibility of any other<lb/>
disease than yellow fever complicating the case.</p>
<p><hi>The mosquitoes used were specially bred from the eggs and kept<lb/>
in a building screened by wire netting. When an insect was wanted<lb/>
for an experiment it was taken into a yellow fever hospital</hi> and<lb/>
allowed to fill itself with the blood of a patient; afterwards at varying<lb/>
intervals from the time of this meal of blood it was purposely applied<lb/>
to nonimmunes in camp.</p>
<p><hi>In December, 5 cases of</hi> the disease were developed as the result of<lb/>
such applications; <hi>in January, 3, and in February, 2</hi>, making in all<lb/>
10, exclusive of the cases of Drs. Carroll and Lazear. <hi>Immediately<lb/>
upon the appearance of the first recognized symptoms of the disease,<lb/>
in any one of these experimental cases, the patient was taken from<lb/>
Camp Lazear to a yellow-fever hospital, 1 mile distant</hi>. Every person<lb/>
in camp was rigidly protected from accidental mosquito bites, and<lb/>
not in a single instance did yellow fever develop in the camp, except<lb/>
at the will of the experimenters.</p>
<p>The experiments were conducted at a season when there was the<lb/>
least chance of naturally acquiring the disease, and the mosquitoes<lb/>
used were kept active by maintaining them at a summer temperature.</p>
<p>A completely mosquito-proof building was divided into two com-<lb/>
partments by a wire-screen partition; infected insects were liberated<lb/>
on one side only. A brave nonimmune entered and remained long<lb/>
enough to allow himself to be bitten several times. He was attacked<lb/>
by yellow fever, while <hi>two susceptible men in the</hi> other compartment<lb/>
did not acquire the disease, <hi>although sleeping there 13 nights</hi>. This<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="S8220017"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
11<lb/>
demonstrates in the simplest and most certain manner that the infec-<lb/>
tiousness of the building was due only to the presence of the insects.</p>
<p>Every attempt was made to infect individuals by means of bedding,<lb/>
clothes, and other articles that had been used and soiled by patients<lb/>
suffering with virulent yellow fever.</p>
<p>Volunteers slept in the room with and handled the most filthy<lb/>
<hi>articles for 20 nights</hi>, but not a symptom of yellow fever was noted<lb/>
among them, nor was their health in the slightest degree affected.<lb/>
Nevertheless they were not immune to the disease, for some of them<lb/>
were afterwards purposely infected by mosquito bites. <hi>This experi-<lb/>
ment indicates at once the uselessness of destroying valuable property<lb/>
for fear of infection. Had the people of the United States known<lb/>
this one fact 100 hundred years ago, an enormous amount of money<lb/>
would have been saved to householders</hi>.</p>
<p>Besides the experimental cases caused by mosquito bite, <hi>four non-<lb/>
immunes were infected by injecting blood drawn</hi> directly from the<lb/>
veins of yellow-fever patients in the <hi>first two days of the disease</hi>,<lb/>
thus demonstrating the presence of an infectious agent in the blood at<lb/>
this early period of the attack.</p>
<p>Even the blood serum of a patient, passed through a bacteria-proof<lb/>
filter, was found to be capable of causing yellow fever in another<lb/>
person.</p>
<p>The details of the experiments are most interesting, but it must<lb/>
here suffice to briefly sum up the principal conclusions of this admirable<lb/>
board of investigators of which <hi>Reed was the master mind</hi>:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. The specific agent in the causation of yellow fever exists in the<lb/>
blood of a patient for <hi>the first three days of his attack, after which</hi><lb/>
time he ceases to be a menace to the health of others.</item>
<item>2. A mosquito of a single species, Stegomyia fasciata , ingesting the<lb/>
blood of a patient during this infective period is <hi>powerless to convey<lb/>
the disease to another person by its bite until about 12 days have</hi><lb/>
elapsed, but can do so thereafter for <hi>an indefinite period, probably<lb/>
during the remainder of its life</hi>.</item>
<item>3. The disease can not in nature be spread in any other way than<lb/>
by the bite of the previously infected Stegomyia. Articles used and<lb/>
soiled by patients do not carry infection.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>These conclusions pointed so clearly to the practical method of<lb/>
exterminating the disease that they were at <hi>once accepted by the<lb/>
sanitary authorities in Cuba, and put to the test in Habana</hi>, where<lb/>
for nearly a century and a half, by actual record, the disease had<lb/>
never failed to appear annually.</p>
<p>In <hi>February, 1901</hi>, the chief sanitary officer in Habana, Maj. W. C.<lb/>
Gorgas, Medical Department, United States Army, instituted meas-<lb/>
ures to eradicate the disease, based entirely on the conclusions of the<lb/>
commission. Cases of yellow fever were required to be reported as<lb/>
promptly as possible, the patient was at first rigidly isolated, and<lb/>
immediately upon the report a force of men from the sanitary depart-<lb/>
ment visited the house. All the rooms of the building and of the<lb/>
neighboring houses were sealed and fumigated to destroy the mos-<lb/>
quitoes present. Window and door screens were put up, and after<lb/>
the death or recovery of the patient, his room was fumigated and<lb/>
every mosquito destroyed. A war of extermination was also waged<lb/>
against mosquitoes in general, and an energetic effort was made to<lb/>
diminish the number bred by draining standing water, screening tanks<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="S8220018"/>
12<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
and vessels, using petroleum on water that could not be drained, and<lb/>
in the most systematic manner destroying the breeding places of the<lb/>
insects.</p>
<p>When the warm season returned a few cases occured, but <hi>by Sep-<lb/>
tember, 1901, the last case of yellow fever originated in Habana</hi>, since<lb/>
which time <hi>the city has been entirely exempt from the</hi> terrible dis-<lb/>
ease, that had there kept stronghold for 150 years. Cases are now<lb/>
admitted into Habana from Mexican ports, but are treated under<lb/>
screens with perfect impunity, in the ordinary city hospitals. The<lb/>
crusade against the insects also caused a very large decrease in mala-<lb/>
rial fevers.</p>
<p>The destruction of the most fatal epidemic disease of the Western<lb/>
Hemisphere, in its favorite home city is but the beginning of the<lb/>
benefit to mankind that may be expected to follow the work of Reed<lb/>
and his associates. There can be no manner of doubt should Mexico.<lb/>
Brazil, and the Central American Republics, where the disease still<lb/>
exists, follow strictly the example set by Habana, that yellow fever<lb/>
will become extinct and the United States forever freed from the<lb/>
scourge that has in the past slain thousands of our citizens and<lb/>
caused the loss of untold treasure.</p>
<p>More recent investigations into the cause and spread of yellow<lb/>
fever have only succeeded in verifying the work of Reed and his<lb/>
commission in every particular and in adding very little to our knowl-<lb/>
edge of the disease.</p>
<p><hi>Later researches by Guiteras in Habana, by the Public Health and<lb/>
Marine-Hospital Service in Vera Cruz</hi>, and lastly by a delegation from<lb/>
the <hi>Pasteur Institute of Paris in Rio de Janeiro</hi>, all confirm in the<lb/>
most convincing manner both the accuracy and comprehensiveness<lb/>
of the conclusions of the American commission. It has been well<lb/>
said that Reed's experiments &ldquo;<hi>will always remain as models in the<lb/>
annals of scientific research, both for the exactness with which they<lb/>
were adapted to the points to be proved, and the precautions taken<lb/>
that no experiment should be vitiated by failure to exclude all possible<lb/>
sources of error</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Appreciation of Reed's work was instant in the scientific world.<lb/>
Honorary degrees from Harvard University and the University of<lb/>
Michigan were conferred upon him, learned societies and distinguished<lb/>
men delighted to honor him, and after his death Congress voted a<lb/>
special pension to his widow.</p>
<p>To the United States the value of his services can not be estimated.<lb/>
<hi>Ninety times has yellow fever invaded the country</hi>, carrying death<lb/>
and destruction, leaving poverty and grief.</p>
<p>New Orleans, Memphis, Charleston, Galveston, Portsmouth, Balti-<lb/>
more, Philadelphia, New York, and many smaller towns have been<lb/>
swept by the disease.</p>
<p>The epidemic of 1853 cost New Orleans 8,000 lives, that of 1793<lb/>
wiped out 10 per cent of Philadelphia's population.</p>
<p>The financial loss to the United States in the one epidemic of 1878<lb/>
was estimated as amounting to $15,335,000, but suffering, panic,<lb/>
fear, and the tears of widows and orphans can never be estimated.<lb/>
Now, however, if yellow fever should again cross our southern<lb/>
border, there need be no disturbance of commerce or loss of prop-<lb/>
erty in the slightest degree comparable with that which epidemics<lb/>
in the past have caused.</p>

<p>The death of Maj. Reed took place November 23, 1902, in Wash-<lb/>
ington, from appendicitis. It is gratifying to think that, although<lb/>
his country and the scientific world were deprived of one from<lb/>
whose future services more benefit to humanity might reasonably be<lb/>
expected, nevertheless he was privileged before his life's close to<lb/>
know that his discovery had been tested, and that a great city was<lb/>
freed from her ancient foe, to know that his conscientious work had<lb/>
contributed immeasurably toward the future prospects of an infant<lb/>
Republic, and even more to the welfare of his own beloved country,<lb/>
whose flag he had served so faithfully.</p>
<p>In the national capital and in the great cities of the United<lb/>
States, there are stately monuments to the country's great ones.<lb/>
Statues of warriors, statesmen, and patriots stand as silent wit-<lb/>
nesses of a people's gratitude. Is there not room for the effigy of<lb/>
Walter Reed, who so clearly pointed out to his fellow man the way<lb/>

<head>SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF MAJ. WALTER REED, SURGEON,<lb/>
UNITED STATES ARMY.</head>
<byline>By <docAuthor>JEFFERSON R. KEAN</docAuthor>, Major, Medical Corps, United States Army.</byline>
<p>Walter Reed, M. D., LL. D., M. A., major and surgeon, United<lb/>
States Army, was born September 13, 1851, in Gloucester County,<lb/>
Va., and was the son of the Rev. Lemuel Sutton Reed, a leading<lb/>
Methodist divine of that State. His ancestors came from North<lb/>
Carolina, having been among the earliest settlers of that colony. He<lb/>
gave early evidence of the intellectual brilliancy and earnestness of <lb/>
purpose which distinguished him in later years, and graduated in<lb/>
medicine at the University of Virginia in 1869. He afterwards took<lb/>
the degree of M. D. in Bellevue Medical College, New York City. He<lb/>
served as house surgeon in the Brooklyn City Hospital and the city<lb/>
hospital on Blackwells Island, and before the age of 21 was appointed<lb/>
a district physician in New York City. He was also appointed one<lb/>
of the five inspectors of the board of health of the city of Brooklyn<lb/>
at the age of 22. In 1875 he entered the Medical Corps of the Army,<lb/>
and for 18 years thereafter performed the customary duties of a<lb/>
medical officer at various posts in different parts of the United States<lb/>
and in the field. His military service included 15 changes of station,<lb/>
with 4 years in Arizona, 5 in the Department of the Platte, 2 in the<lb/>
Department of Dakota, 3 in the South, and 3 years in the East. He<lb/>
was promoted full surgeon with the rank of major December 4, 1893,<lb/>
and at the time of his death was first on the list of majors in the<lb/>
Medical Department of the Army. In the fall of 1890 he was assigned<lb/>
to duty as attending surgeon in Baltimore, Md., which position he<lb/>
held for a year. He promptly embraced this opportunity to make<lb/>
special studies in bacteriology and pathology, and soon won the atten-<lb/>
tion and esteem of Prof. William H. Welch. This was the beginning<lb/>
of a close friendship with that distinguished scientist which lasted<lb/>
until the untimely death of Maj. Reed, on November 23, 1902.</p>
<p>In 1893 Maj. Reed was placed on duty in Washington as curator<lb/>
of the Army Medical Museum and appointed the professor of bacte-<lb/>
riology of the newly organized Army Medical School.</p>
<p>In the 10 years subsequent to this date, in the intervals of his<lb/>
routine duties and others which came to him as a medical officer, such<lb/>
as member of examining boards, teaching, investigation of numerous<lb/>
sanitary questions, and making sanitary inspections, he was able, by<lb/>
immense industry, to obtain a position in the scientific world such as<lb/>
comes to few of those who are able to devote a lifetime exclusively to<lb/>
such pursuits.</p>
<p>Of the numerous monographs which show his scientific work during<lb/>
this time, all are creditable; nor do any show marks of carelessness or<lb/>
haste, in spite of the limited time which he had at his disposal.</p>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
15</p>
<p>In 1898, when typhoid fever prevailed so extensively in the camps<lb/>
of the Volunteer Armies of the United States, Maj. Reed was put at<lb/>
<hi>the head of a commission</hi>--Dr. Victor C. Vaughan, of the University<lb/>
of Michigan, and Dr. E. O. Shakespeare, of Philadelphia, being the<lb/>
other members--to study the causation and methods of spread of that<lb/>
disease. This investigation, which covered a period of more than a<lb/>
year, was remarkable for the patience and skill with which a vast<lb/>
number of details were assembled and studied, and it marks a great<lb/>
advance in our knowledge of this widespread disease. Among the<lb/>
points of great value brought out were the importance of the common<lb/>
fly as a carrier of infection in camps, and the frequency with which<lb/>
the contagion of typhoid fever is in camp life spread from man to<lb/>
man by immediate contact with each other or with bedding, tents,<lb/>
<hi>and implements which</hi> have become infected. <hi>Strangely enough, this<lb/>
report has never been published in full, but only an abstract of it<lb/>
containing some 240 pages, and, on account of the failure to publish<lb/>
and disseminate the full report, its conclusions are but little known<lb/>
abroad or among the members of the medical</hi> profession in this<lb/>
country. Many of the facts contained in it were rediscovered by<lb/>
the English during the Boer War, and it is probable that its prompt<lb/>
publication and dissemination would have saved many thousand lives<lb/>
during that war.</p>
<p>The first work by Maj. Reed bearing on the causation of yellow<lb/>
fever was in 1899-1900, when he overthrew the claim of the dis-<lb/>
tinguished bacteriologist, Sanarelli, to have discovered the bacillus of<lb/>
yellow fever, by his demonstration that the <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> (Sana-<lb/>
relli) was an organism widely disseminated in this country and having<lb/>
no causative relation to that disease. He began the special work with<lb/>
which his name will always be inseparably associated as one of the ben-<lb/>
efactors of mankind in June, 1900, when he went to Cuba as presi-<lb/>
dent of a commission to study the infectious diseases of Cuba, with<lb/>
special reference to yellow fever. The other members of this commis-<lb/>
sion were Acting Asst. Surgs. James Carroll, Jesse W. Lazear, and<lb/>
A. Agramonte. The time was most opportune for such investigation,<lb/>
as the disease was at that time prevalent both in Habana and in the<lb/>
little town of Quemados, near the camp of the American troops, and<lb/>
it was plainly evident that the energetic measures of the American<lb/>
military government to clean up the towns, disinfect, and enforce<lb/>
other sanitary measures were without effect in preventing the spread<lb/>
of this particular disease. Maj. Reed became convinced that proper<lb/>
sanitation was not all that was needed, and that some other agent than<lb/>
unclean conditions was responsible for the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>The transmission of malaria by a certain species of mosquito had<lb/>
been recently demonstrated by the English military surgeon, Ronald<lb/>
Ross. The theory had also been advanced both by <hi>a Mobile physician</hi><lb/>
and by Dr. Finlay, of Habana, that a mosquito was the agent for the<lb/>
transmission of yellow fever; <hi>but these theories, being unsupported<lb/>
by scientific demonstration, received no more attention than the vast<lb/>
number of others which had been at one</hi> time or another advanced<lb/>
with regard to this mysterious and deadly disease.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed's attention was attracted by a paper on the spread of yellow<lb/>
fever in Ormond, Miss., by Dr. H. R. Carter, of the Marine-Hospital<lb/>
Service, in which it was shown that although the period of incuba-<lb/>
tion of the disease was 5 days, 15 or 20 elapsed before a house<lb/>
<pb n="16" id="S8220022"/>
16<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
became infected after a patient sick with yellow fever was carried into<lb/>
it. <hi>He inferred that the difference between the time of incubation and<lb/>
the time required to infect a building was due to the fact that the<lb/>
infective agent passed through a stage of development in the body of<lb/>
some biting insect as an intermediate host</hi>, and he at once determined<lb/>
to conduct his experiments along that line. It was evident to his mind<lb/>
that the solution of this question, which meant so much for the human<lb/>
race, could never be satisfactorily determined without experiments on<lb/>
human beings, and he went to Gen. Wood, the military governor of<lb/>
Cuba, to ask permission to conduct such experiments, and for a sum<lb/>
of money to liberally reward volunteers who should submit them-<lb/>
selves for experiment. Gen. Wood promptly granted both, with a<lb/>
ready appreciation of the importance of the matter and the force of<lb/>
Dr. Reed's arguments, which will entitle him to no small measure of<lb/>
the glory of this discovery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, during a temporary absence of Dr. Reed in the United<lb/>
States, his assistants, Dr. James Carroll and Dr. Jesse W. Lazear,<lb/>
who had offered themselves as the first volunteers for these experi-<lb/>
ments, had demonstrated that mosquitoes would convey yellow fever.<lb/>
Dr. Carroll, who was the first experimental case, suffered a very severe<lb/>
attack, but recovered. <hi>Dr. Lazear was not infected at this time</hi>, due<lb/>
to the fact that the conditions necessary to the transmission of the<lb/>
disease by the mosquito were not yet understood, but he was bitten<lb/>
while working in the yellow-fever ward somewhat later, and died a<lb/>
martyr of science, working in behalf of humanity. This was the only<lb/>
fatality which occurred in these experiments. <hi>The fourth member of<lb/>
the commission, Dr. Agramonte, did not participate in the mosquito<lb/>
work of the commission until a later date, nor did he share their dan-<lb/>
gers, as he was a Cuban and immune</hi>.</p>
<p>Immediately upon Dr. Reed's return arrangements were made, with<lb/>
the assistance of the military governor, as stated above, for a series of<lb/>
experiments which, by precision of detail and rigidness of control,<lb/>
would admit of no uncertainity of interpretation and would be a per-<lb/>
fect demonstration, carrying conviction to every scientific and<lb/>
unprejudiced mind. These experiments will, as <hi>stated by Prof.<lb/>
William H. Welch, always</hi> remain as models in the annals of scientific<lb/>
research, both for the exactness with which they were adapted to the<lb/>
points to be proved and the precautions taken that no experiment<lb/>
should be vitiated by failure to exclude all possible sources of error.<lb/>
They were conducted in a camp especially constructed for the pur-<lb/>
pose, <hi>about 4 miles</hi> from Habana, and appropriately named &ldquo;Camp<lb/>
Lazear.&rdquo; The history of the work is best given in Dr. Reed's own<lb/>
words, in an article published in the Journal of Hygiene, Cambridge,<lb/>
England.</p>

<p>The persons taking an important part in the investigations in<lb/>
Cuba, which resulted in the demonstration of the fact that yellow<lb/>
fever is transmitted by a species of mosquito, were <hi>three members of</hi><lb/>
the board appointed to investigate epidemic diseases in Cuba--<lb/>
Walter Reed, James Carroll, and Jesse W. Lazear--and the indi-<lb/>
viduals who submitted themselves for experimentation by receiving<lb/>
the bites of infected mosquitoes, by receiving injections of blood from<lb/>
yellow-fever patients, and by sleeping in bedding which had been<lb/>
used by yellow-fever patients.</p>
<p>When the Yellow Fever Commission, composed of Walter Reed,<lb/>
James Carroll, Jesse W. Lazear, and A. Agramonte,<hi>assembled in<lb/>
Habana they had no thought of investigating the connection of the<lb/>
mosquito with the spread of yellow fever. This idea came to Dr.<lb/>
Reed</hi> after the board had demonstrated that the claim of Sanarelli,<lb/>
concurred in by Wasdin and Geddins, that the <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi><lb/>
was the cause of yellow fever was without foundation. <hi>Dr. Reed<lb/>
then determined to investigate the theory of Dr. Carlos Finlay,<lb/>
that the mosquito was instrumental in conveying yellow fever</hi>, which<lb/>
theory Finlay had failed to demonstrate, and which was not then<lb/>
accepted by scientific men. <hi>This determination was reached for the<lb/>
reasons which are well stated in Dr. Kelly's biography, and was<lb/>
original with Reed, not being suggested to him by anyone</hi>. The<lb/>
<hi>final</hi> determination to investigate the mosquito theory was arrived at<lb/>
during an informal meeting of the board (Dr. Agramonte being<lb/>
absent) at Columbia Barracks on the evening before Dr. Reed's<lb/>

departure for the United States, early in August, <del>1901</del><add>1900</add>. It was<lb/>
agreed by these members of the board that in making the experi-<lb/>
ments on human beings, by which alone the demonstration could be<lb/>
made, that they should submit themselves as subjects for experimen-<lb/>
tation. To Dr. Lazear, who was familiar with mosquito work, was<lb/>
assigned the duty of breeding and infecting the mosquitoes, while<lb/>
Dr. Carroll was to continue the bacteriological work on which the<lb/>
board had been engaged.</p>
<p><hi>On August 2, 1900</hi>, before the mosquitoes were ready for the<lb/>
experiment, Dr. Reed was <hi>called back to</hi> Washington to prepare<lb/>
for publication the abstract of the report of the board appointed in<lb/>
1898 to investigate the spread of typhoid fever in the volunteer<lb/>
camps in the United States, of which board he was president. This<lb/>
vast work, of <hi>which the full report was published by</hi> special authority<lb/>
of Congress about a year after Dr. Reed's death, by the only sur-<lb/>
viving member of the board, Prof. Victor C. Vaughan, of the Uni-<lb/>
versity of Michigan, was one of the most valuable contributions to<lb/>
science which has been made by the Surgeon General's Office. The<lb/>
work of preparation of the abstract report had been brought to a<lb/>
standstill by the sudden death of the third member of the board,<lb/>
Dr. Edward O. Shakespeare, of Philadelphia, and Dr. Reed's presence<lb/>
at this time was essential for its completion.</p>
<p>During Dr. Reed's absence the inoculations by means of the<lb/>
mosquito were begun. On August 11, <hi>Dr. Lazear made the</hi> first<lb/>
experiment, but nine distinct inoculations on persons, <hi>including him-<lb/>
self and Acting Asst. Surg. A. S. Pinto, were unsuccessful</hi>. We know<lb/>
now that these failures were due to two facts--first, that patients<lb/>
after the third day of the disease can not convey the infection to the<lb/>
mosquito, and second, that after having bitten a yellow-fever case the <lb/>
mosquito can not transmit the disease until after an interval of at<lb/>
least 12 days. On August 27 one mosquito was applied to Dr.<lb/>
Carroll, one which happened to fulfill both of these conditions. The<lb/>
result was a very severe attack of yellow fever, in which for a time<lb/>
his life hung in the balance. This was thus the first experimental<lb/>
case. <hi>The fever developed on the 31st of August, on which day Dr.<lb/>
Lazear applied the same mosquito which bit Dr. Carroll with three<lb/>
others to another person. This man came down with a mild but<lb/>
well-marked case</hi>.</p>
<p>On September 13 Dr. Lazear, while on a visit to Las Animas<lb/>
Hospital (for the purpose of collecting blood from yellow-fever<lb/>
patients for study) was bitten by a mosquito of undetermined species,<lb/>
<hi>which he deliberately allowed to remain</hi> on the back of his hand until<lb/>
it had satisfied its hunger. Five days thereafter he came down,<lb/>
without other exposure, with yellow fever, which progressed steadily<lb/>
to a fatal termination. These three cases established in Reed's mind<lb/>
the proof of the mosquito theory and made it, in the opinion of his<lb/>
friends, an unnecessary and foolish risk for him, at his age, to submit<lb/>
himself to inoculation. These cases, with his deductions therefrom,<lb/>
were reported by the board in a paper called &ldquo;The etiology of yellow<lb/>
fever--A preliminary note,&rdquo; read before the American Public Health<lb/>
Association at <del><hi>Buffalo</hi>, N. Y.,</del> October 22-26, 1900. He then<lb/>
immediately returned to Cuba to undertake a second and more<lb/>
elaborate series of experiments which were made possible by the<lb/>
promise made to him by Gen. Wood on <hi>October 12</hi>, when told by<lb/>
<pb n="19" id="S8220025"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
19<lb/>
Reed of the experiments already made, to assist him with whatever<lb/>
money was necessary. This, the second series of experiments, began<lb/>
November 20 at an experimental camp near Quemados, called Camp<lb/>
Lazear, and <hi>embraced 14 cases</hi>, of which the last was taken sick<lb/>
February 10, 1901. <hi>Of these, 10 were mosquito infections and 4<lb/>
were infected by injection of the blood of yellow-fever</hi> patients. All<lb/>
of these cases recovered.</p>
<p><hi>A third series of 6 cases</hi> was produced by Dr. James Carroll<lb/>
the next fall to settle certain undetermined facts as regards the<lb/>
etiology of the disease. The first of these cases came down with<lb/>
the fever <hi>September 19, 1901, and the last on October 23, 1901</hi>. Of<lb/>
these cases <hi>2 were caused by mosquitoes and 4 by blood injec-<lb/>
tions</hi>. None of them resulted fatally. The highly dangerous char-<lb/>
acter of these experiments and the good fortune of the board in its<lb/>
second and third series of cases is shown by the fact that Dr. Guiteras,<lb/>
of Habana, in a series of <hi>7 cases inoculated in Habana lost 3, bring</hi>-<lb/>
ing his experiments abruptly to an end.</p>
<p><hi>No enumeration of unsuccessful cases</hi>--namely, those which failed<lb/>
to cause the disease--<hi>has been made</hi>, although it is obvious that the<lb/>
persons undergoing such experiments exhibited as much courage as<lb/>
those in which the disease was transmitted. This is especially true<lb/>
of the cases occurring after the severe case of Dr. Carroll and the<lb/>
fatal case of Dr. Lazear. Certain ones of these unsuccessful cases<lb/>
deserve special mention, being those made with infected bedding<lb/>
at Camp Lazear. In a specially constructed house at that camp,<lb/>
which was intentionally ill ventilated and kept continually at a<lb/>
summer temperature, was placed a large quantity of bedding taken<lb/>
from the beds of patients sick with yellow fever in Habana and<lb/>
soiled with their discharges. In this house Acting Asst. Surg. R. P.<lb/>
<hi>Cook</hi> and two privates of the Hospital Corps slept continuously<lb/>
from November 30 to December 19. <hi>Each morning they packed the<lb/>
various soiled articles of bedding in boxes and unpacked them at<lb/>
night, when they were used to sleep on</hi>.</p>
<p>From December 21, 1900, to January 10, 1901, the building was<lb/>
again occupied by two nonimmune Americans under the same cir-<lb/>
cumstances, except that an additional stock of very much fouled<lb/>
bedding and clothing had been added to the collection, and these<lb/>
men slept every night in the very garments worn by yellow-fever<lb/>
patients throughout their entire attacks, besides making use of their<lb/>
much soiled pillow slips, sheets, and blankets. A third couple of<lb/>
Hospital Corps men succeeded these for an equal length of time.<lb/>
None of these seven individuals contracted yellow fever, but the<lb/>
<hi>courage and fortitude shown by them certainly equal</hi> that of those<lb/>
who submitted to the bites of the mosquitoes, it being borne in mind<lb/>
that belief in the transmission of yellow fever by infected bedding<lb/>
and clothing <hi>was at that time practically universal, whereas the<lb/>
mosquito theory had still very few converts</hi>.</p>
<p>After this brief history of this great discovery a statement of the<lb/>
part borne by each of the more important participators in it is<lb/>
necessary to a determination of the reward which would be appro-<lb/>
priate to each.</p>
<p>Maj. Walter Reed, surgeon, United States Army, president of the<lb/>
commission to investigate and study the epidemic diseases in Cuba,<lb/>
died in Washington from appendicitis, November 23, 1902, at the<lb/>
<pb n="20" id="S8220026"/>
20<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
age of 51. At the time of his death the Secretary of War had said in<lb/>
his report, which was then in press but not yet given out:</p>
<p>The brilliant character of this scientific achievement, its inestimable value to<lb/>
mankind, the saving of thousands of lives, and the deliverance of the Atlantic seacoast<lb/>
from constant apprehension, demand special recognition from the Government of<lb/>
the United States.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed is the ranking major in the Medical Department, and within a few months<lb/>
will, by operation of law, become lieutenant colonel. <hi>I ask that the President be<lb/>
authorized to appoint him Assistant Surgeon General with the rank of colonel</hi>.</p>
<p>Gen. Leonard Wood said of him in an address delivered at a<lb/>
memorial meeting of scientific men in Washington, D. C., shortly<lb/>
after his death:</p>
<p>I know of no other man on this side of the world who has done so much for humanity<lb/>
as Dr. Reed. His discovery results in the saving of more lives annually than were<lb/>
lost in the Cuban war, and saves the commercial interests of the world a greater finan-<lb/>
cial loss each year than the cost of the Cuban war. He came to Cuba at a time when<lb/>
<hi>one-third of the officers of my staff died of yellow fever</hi>, and we were discouraged at<lb/>
the failure of our efforts to control the disease.</p>
<p>In the months when the disease was ordinarily worst the disease was checked<lb/>
and driven from Habana. That was the first time in nearly 200 years that the city<lb/>
had been rid of it. The value of his discovery can not be appreciated by persons<lb/>
who are not familiar with the conditions of tropical countries. Hereafter it will never<lb/>
be possible for yellow fever to gain such headway that <hi>quarantine will exist from the<lb/>
mouth of the Potomac to the mouth of the Rio Grande</hi>. Future generations will<lb/>
appreciate fully the value of Dr. Reed's services. <hi>His was the originating, directing,<lb/>
and controlling mind in this work, and the others were assistants only</hi>.</p>
<p>In a letter from Prof. Welch to the Secretary of War he said:</p>
<p>Dr. Reed's researches in yellow fever are by far the most important contributions to<lb/>
science which have ever come from any Army surgeon. In my judgment they are<lb/>
the most valuable contributions to medicine and public hygiene which have ever<lb/>
been made in this country with the exception of the discovery of an&aelig;sthesia. They<lb/>
have led and will lead to the saving of thousands of lives. <hi>I am in a position</hi> to know<lb/>
that the credit for the original ideas embodied in this work <hi>belongs wholly</hi> to Maj.<lb/>
Reed.</p>
<p>Prof. Welch was Dr. Reed's teacher in bacteriology and was his<lb/>
intimate and confidential friend, with whom he <hi>consulted</hi> about the<lb/>
details of the work in Cuba.</p>
<p>A bill prepared in this office for a pension for his widow, equal in<lb/>
amount to his monthly pay, was passed, but the amount was so cut<lb/>
down that while it keeps the wolf from the door it does not pro-<lb/>
vide an adequate and comfortable income. It is not probable, how-<lb/>
ever, that Congress would increase this pension, and an effort has<lb/>
been made to supplement it by the raising of a fund of $25,000 by the<lb/>
Walter Reed Memorial Association, incorporated for this purpose<lb/>
in the District of Columbia. The interest on this fund will be given<lb/>
Mrs. Reed during her lifetime, and the principal, after her death, will<lb/>
be devoted to some form of memorial. This fund lacks at present<lb/>
about $6,000 of completion. The existence of this association, should<lb/>
its hopes be attained, does not, however, absolve the nation from the<lb/>
obligation of a fitting recognition for this great work, and it is the<lb/>
opinion of the undersigned, which, it is believed, is shared by the<lb/>
vast majority of physicians in the United States, that Congress<lb/>
<hi>should erect a statue to Walter Reed</hi> in Washington. The assistance<lb/>
of the President in inducing Congress to do so is requested.</p>
<p>The second member of the commission was Dr. James Carroll, at<lb/>
that time acting assistant surgeon, United States Army.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll is now 52 years old. He entered the military service<lb/>
June 9, 1874, and served as private, corporal, sergeant, and hospital<lb/>
<pb n="21" id="S8220027"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
21<lb/>
steward from that date to May 21, 1898, when he was appointed acting<lb/>
assistant surgeon. He was appointed first lieutenant and assistant<lb/>
surgeon in the Medical Corps October 27, 1902, which rank he still<lb/>
holds.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll was Dr. Reed's truest assistant and coadjutor from the<lb/>
inception of the work which resulted in the discovery of the method<lb/>
of propagation of yellow fever. As stated above, the third series of<lb/>
experiments were performed by Dr. Carroll alone, <hi>Dr. Reed having<lb/>
been refused permission to return to Cuba to complete his work</hi>.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll was the first experimental case of yellow fever, and he<lb/>
suffered a very severe attack, to which <hi>he attributes a heart trouble</hi><lb/>
from which he now suffers. At the time of undergoing this experi-<lb/>
ment he was 46 years old, an age at which the risk from this disease<lb/>
is very great, as its mortality rapidly increases with age of patient.<lb/>
He had at that time a wife and five children who had no other means<lb/>
of support except his pay as an acting assistant surgeon.</p>
<p>It is recommended that Congress be asked to <hi>pass a special act pro-<lb/>
moting Dr. Carroll</hi>, on account of his services in connection with this<lb/>
discovery and the courage shown by him in subjecting himself to experi-<lb/>
ment, to the rank of lieutenant colonel, the number of medical officers<lb/>
in that grade being increased by one for that purpose; also his name<lb/>
and effigy should appear on the monument to Walter Reed.</p>
<p>Dr. Jesse W. Lazear was the third member of the commission.</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear was a native of Baltimore and a graduate of Johns Hop-<lb/>
kins University, afterwards getting his professional degree at Columbia<lb/>
University and Bellevue. At the time he incurred his death in the<lb/>
course of these experiments, as above mentioned, he was 34 years<lb/>
old. He left a wife and two young children, the younger a little <del>son</del><add>daughter</add><lb/>
born a few months before his death, whom he never saw. Mrs. Lazear<lb/>
received from Congress a pension of $17 a month with $2 additional<lb/>
for each of two minor children until they reach the age of 16. Also<lb/>
a battery in Baltimore Harbor was, by direction of the Secretary of<lb/>
War, named in his honor. It is believed that this recognition on the<lb/>
part of the nation for his services is utterly inadequate. His widow's<lb/>
pension should be increased to $100 a month, and steps should be<lb/>
taken to perpetuate his name in connection with the Walter Reed<lb/>
monument above suggested.</p>
<p>Dr. A. Agramonte was the fourth member of the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Commission. He was a Cuban by birth, an immune to yellow fever,<lb/>
and having been assigned other work, took no part in the first series<lb/>
of experiments with regard to the conveyance of the disease by the<lb/>
mosquito, of which, in fact, he was not at the time cognizant. Being<lb/>
an immune, he ran no risk in connection with this work, and it is<lb/>
believed that his contributions to it have been sufficiently recognized<lb/>
in the association of his name with the other members of the com-<lb/>
mission who brought about this great discovery.</p>
<p><hi>Twenty-three of the men who submitted themselves for experiment<lb/>
by the board contracted yellow fever, beginning</hi> with Dr. James Car-<lb/>
roll, who was taken sick August 31, 1900, and ending with John R.<lb/>
Bullard, who was taken sick October 23, 1901.</p>
<p>Conspicuous among them was <hi>John J. Moran, a civilian clerk</hi><lb/>
employed at the headquarters of Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, at Quemados,<lb/>
who was one of the earliest volunteers for the second set of experi-<lb/>
ments, and whose action was dictated by the purest motives of<lb/>
<pb n="22" id="S8220028"/>
22<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
altruism and self-devotion. <hi>Mr. Moran disclaimed, before submitting<lb/>
to the experiments, any desire for reward, and has never accepted any<lb/>
since, although he was offered the $200</hi> which the liberality of the<lb/>
military governor enabled the commission to give to each experi-<lb/>
mental patient, the members of the board excepted. Such was his<lb/>
modesty that he has made no effort, so far as known to this office, to<lb/>
make known his connection with these experiments and reap the<lb/>
credit which is so justly due him. Mr. Moran was a native of <del>Ohio</del><add><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></add>.<lb/>
His present address is not known to this office. The first inoculations<lb/>
in the case of Mr. Moran were for some reason unsuccessful, on Novem-<lb/>
ber 26 and 29. He did not suffer an attack until after the third<lb/>
inoculation, on December 21.</p>
<p>The same remarks apply to the first experimental case of the second<lb/>
set, Pvt. John R. Kissinger, hospital corps, who volunteered at the<lb/>
same time with Moran and equally disclaimed any desire for reward.</p>
<p>Pvt. Kissinger did not leave Cuba immediately after the experi-<lb/>
ments, <hi>as did Mr. Moran</hi>, and therefore the military authorities were<lb/>
able to reward him in some measure along with other enlisted men<lb/>
who volunteered for these experiments. He was promoted acting<lb/>
hospital steward, <hi>presented with a gold watch by the</hi> chief surgeon<lb/>
of the department in the presence of all the medical officers and hos-<lb/>
pital corps men on duty at Columbia Barracks, and also received a<lb/>
<hi>present of $115 in cash. He took his discharge November 14, 1901</hi>,<lb/>
and has since (on December 17, 1903) made application for pension.<lb/>
This was <hi>refused for lack of evidence that his ill-health was incident</hi><lb/>
to <hi>the service</hi>.</p>
<p><hi>Of the other experimental cases, seven were Spanish immigrants<lb/>
who submitted to experiments purely for the money which they were<lb/>
promised</hi>. With regard to those who were American soldiers, how-<lb/>
ever, 10 in number, in addition to those already mentioned, <hi>it can<lb/>
not be doubted that, although they received pecuniary rewards, a<lb/>
desire to assist in what they appreciated was a great and glorious<lb/>
work, together with a spirit of adventure, was the most powerful<lb/>
motive</hi>. The same is true of the last experimental case, Mr. John R.<lb/>
Bullard, a graduate of Harvard, where he was a distinguished athlete<lb/>
and captain of the university crew. The names of these men, with<lb/>
the dates of their attack, is appended with this report.</p>
<p>It remains to mention Dr. Robert P. Cook, acting assistant surgeon,<lb/>
and the six privates of the hospital corps, who were for <hi>20 nights</hi><lb/>
shut up in the infected bedding house at Camp Lazear. These<lb/>
experiments, which were absolutely necessary to demonstrate that<lb/>
yellow fever could not be carried otherwise than by the mosquito,<lb/>
had for these men, so far as they knew, an equal element of danger<lb/>
with the other experiments and had in addition such repulsive<lb/>
and disagreeable features as to test to the full their hardihood and<lb/>
patience. Much of the bedding upon which they slept and which<lb/>
they were required daily to handle, was so soiled with the discharges<lb/>
of the sick as to be very repulsive to the nose and eye, and the last<lb/>
experimenters actually slept in the pajamas and sheets which had<lb/>
been worn by severe cases of yellow fever. The names of these<lb/>
men are appended to the list given below of experimental cases of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>It will be observed that three of these men--Folk, Jernegan, and<lb/>
Hanberry--afterwards submitted to the mosquito inoculation or<lb/>
<pb n="23" id="S8220029"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
23<lb/>
blood injection in order to demonstrate their nonimmunity at the<lb/>
time of the first experiment.</p>
<p>It is believed that the names of all the Americans on this list<lb/>
should be placed on a tablet in connection with the monument to<lb/>
Walter Reed.</p>
<p>From the foregoing it will be seen that the total disbursements<lb/>
of this great nation in the way of rewards for those who made possible<lb/>
this discovery and their families, amounts to $146 a month. As to<lb/>
its value to the American people attention is invited to the quota-<lb/>
tions from Gen. Wood and Prof. Welch given above, and others given<lb/>
in the inclosed circulars published by the Walter Reed Memorial<lb/>
Association.</p>
<p>How discreditable appears this niggardly provision when com-<lb/>
pared with the action of the English Government which more than<lb/>
a century ago, when the purchasing power of money was far greater<lb/>
than at present, gave to Jenner, the discoverer of vaccination, grants<lb/>
amounting to &pound;30,000 sterling. He also received from a subscrip-<lb/>
tion in India &pound;7,383 sterling, while the Reed Memorial has so far<lb/>
succeeded in raising only a little over half that sum.</p>
<p>It is believed that if the President would exert his great personal<lb/>
influence in furtherance of the aims of that association its task<lb/>
would be soon completed.</p>

<head>YELLOW-FEVER COMMISSION.</head>
<p>[Senate Document No. 520, Sixty-first Congress, second session.]</p>
<p>WAR DEPARTMENT,<lb/>
OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Washington, April 29, <hi>1910</hi></hi>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR SENATOR: It gives me great pleasure to comply with<lb/>
the request contained in your letter of April 20, to furnish you with a<lb/>
report of the occurrences which led to the appointment of the yellow-<lb/>
fever commission, of which Maj. Walter Reed was president, and the<lb/>
names of the persons connected with the experiments of the com-<lb/>
mission, together with other data which is available concerning them.</p>
<p>Surg. Gen. Sternberg was for many years one of the leading<lb/>
authorities in the world on the subject of yellow fever, and had made,<lb/>
under the direction of the President of the United States, very<lb/>
laborious investigations as to its cause in Habana, Brazil, and Mexico.<lb/>
These investigations were unsuccessful because, as we now know, the<lb/>
organism of yellow fever is invisible to the microscope, but they<lb/>
served a valuable purpose in enabling Dr. Sternberg to disprove<lb/>
the claims of other investigators to have discovered the causative<lb/>
organism and to have prepared protective inoculations against the<lb/>
disease. His attention having been attracted by the claim of Sana-<lb/>
relli, of Buenos Aires, to have discovered the cause of yellow fever<lb/>
in the <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi>, he ordered Maj. Reed, at that time pro-<lb/>
fessor of bacteriology in the Army Medical School, to study this<lb/>
organism in connection with an organism discovered by Sternberg<lb/>
in the bodies of yellow-fever patients in Habana, and named by him<lb/>
bacillus X. This investigation was continued by a board consisting<lb/>
of Maj. Walter Reed, surgeon, United States Army, and Acting<lb/>
Asst. Surgs. James Carroll, Aristides Agramonte, and Jesse W.<lb/>
Lazear, United States Army, which was appointed to meet at Camp<lb/>
Columbia, near Habana, Cuba, in May, 1900. <hi>The instructions to<lb/>
Maj. Reed</hi>, president of this board, included the following:</p>
<p>You will naturally give <hi>special attention</hi> to questions relating to the etiology and<lb/>
prevention of <hi>yellow fever</hi>. As you are familiar with what has already been done by<lb/>
other bacteriologists in this field of investigation, <hi>I do not consider it necessary to give<lb/>
you any suggestions or detailed instructions</hi>. But it is evident that the most important<lb/>
question which will occupy your attention is that which relates to the etiology of this<lb/>
disease.</p>
<p>You will also take advantage of such opportunities as may offer for the study of other<lb/>
infectious diseases, and especially of the malarial fevers prevailing in the island of<lb/>
Cuba. An important question in connection with the diseases of tropical and semi-<lb/>
tropical countries relates to the etiology of febrile attacks of short duration, to which<lb/>
strangers are especially subject. Should you have time, there will be ample oppor-<lb/>
tunity for the study of leprosy in the lepers' hospital in the city of Habana. Attention<lb/>
should also be given to the infectious disease of the lower animals, in case any such<lb/>
prevail, the etiology of which has not been definitely determined.</p>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
25</p>
<p>One member of the board, Dr. Aristides Agramonte, lived in<lb/>
Habana, and another, Dr. Jesse W. Lazear, was already stationed at<lb/>
Columbia Barracks, having <hi>joined there on February 13, 1900</hi>. The<lb/>
remaining members of the board arrived in Cuba June 25, 1900.<lb/>
They were able to prove conclusively that in 18 cases of unmistakable<lb/>
yellow fever investigated from beginning to end bacillus icteroides was<lb/>
not present and that this organism could not be the cause of the dis-<lb/>
ease. These conclusions were diametrically opposite to those of Drs.<lb/>
Wasdin and Geddings, of the Marine-Hospital Service, who likewise<lb/>
at that time were studying yellow fever in Habana, and who con-<lb/>
firmed the findings of Sanarelli. The board then proceeded to investi-<lb/>
gate the theory advanced by Finlay, that yellow fever was conveyed<lb/>
by mosquitoes. A full history of these experiments has been pub-<lb/>
lished in the reports of the board, and a brief account of it, together<lb/>
with a list of the persons who submitted to experimental inoculation,<lb/>
was given in a memorandum prepared for the President by this office<lb/>
on August 30, 1906, and transmitted as a special message to Congress<lb/>
on December 5, 1906. It was published as Senate Document No. 10,<lb/>
Fifty-ninth Congress, second session, a copy being inclosed.</p>
<p>Before taking up individually the men concerned in these experi-<lb/>
ments, in order to state what is known about them at the present<lb/>
time, it may be mentioned that <hi>the Spaniards who were inoculated<lb/>
did so for the pecuniary inducement offered them. After receiving<lb/>
the reward offered them by the liberality of the military government<lb/>
of Cuba, $200 for each person successfully inoculated, they passed<lb/>
from the scene and nothing further is known concerning them.<lb/>
While their names should be preserved as a matter of historical<lb/>
interest, it is considered that they have been well rewarded for their<lb/>
share in the matter, especially as the idea of assisting in the advance-<lb/>
ment of science was not a controlling motive for their action</hi>. Also<lb/>
it should be stated that <hi>it can not be demonstrated that these experi-<lb/>
ments caused the death or subsequent ill health of any of the partici-<lb/>
pants, with the exception of Dr. Lazear and of three individuals who<lb/>
died in the course of the experiments which were conducted by Maj.<lb/>
Gorgas and Dr. John Guiteras at Las Animas Hospital, Habana,<lb/>
between February and December, 1901, which will be referred to later</hi>.</p>
<p>In view of the facts which have come to the attention of this office<lb/>
since the preparation of the memorandum for the President, it is<lb/>
believed that that memorandum does not do justice to the importance<lb/>
of the part which Dr. Agramonte took in these investigations. Dr.<lb/>
Agramonte has made the following statement with regard to the<lb/>
work of the board.</p>
<p>In the investigations of the board with reference to <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi>, Dr. Carroll<lb/>
had the bacteriological work, Dr. Agramonte the autopsy and gross pathology, Dr.<lb/>
Jesse W. Lazear the microscopical pathology.</p>
<p><hi>In June, 1900, Dr. Agramonte was sent to the city of Santa Clara</hi> to investigate the<lb/>
outbreak of yellow fever in that city, and <hi>in July he was sent to the city of Pinar del</hi><lb/>
Rio to investigate the outbreak of yellow fever among the American troops, which<lb/>
the surgeons stationed there had failed to recognize as such. Dr. Agramonte promptly<lb/>
recognized the true character of the disease, and was <hi>joined there by Maj. Reed a<lb/>
couple of days later</hi>. It was there that for the first time the probability of mosquito<lb/>
agency in transmitting the disease was <hi>seriously discussed</hi> by <hi>members of the board</hi>,<lb/>
and it was decided to carry out some research in this direction.</p>
<p>As Dr. Lazear had obtained considerable training in <hi>mosquito work while in Italy</hi>,<lb/>
and none of the other members of the board had any, it was agreed that he take up<lb/>
this part of the work in the beginning. Dr. Carroll continued to investigate the<lb/>
bacteria and Dr. Agramonte the pathological anatomy of yellow fever.</p>
<pb n="26" id="S8220032"/>
<p>26<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>Maj. Reed at this time returned to Washington for the purpose of completing the<lb/>
report upon &ldquo;Typhoid Fever in the Army,&rdquo; in collaboration with Drs. Shakespeare<lb/>
and Vaughan.</p>
<p>Lazear began to breed, dissect, classify, and infect mosquitoes, <hi>in which work Carroll<lb/>
and Agramonte took little or no part</hi>. Now and then Lazear would apply them to<lb/>
whoever allowed it. Most of the mosquitoes died early in captivity. <hi>Lazear, Carroll,<lb/>
and several other persons had been bitten several times by mosquitoes which</hi> pre-<lb/>
viously had fed on yellow fever blood, without result, so that the theory of mosquito<lb/>
transmission was gradually being discredited, until Carroll fell sick, on the 30th of<lb/>
August (1900), <hi>entirely innocent of the real nature of his illness</hi>.</p>
<p>Suspecting the origin of his infection and its real gravity, <hi>Drs. Lazear and Agra-<lb/>
monte decided</hi> to test the mosquito which presumably had caused Carroll's attack by<lb/>
applying it to the first nonimmune individual who might allow it.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the <hi>afternoon</hi> of August 31, the same mosquito and three others, were<lb/>
<hi>applied</hi> to an American soldier who had not left Columbia Barracks (which was free<lb/>
from yellow fever) for 57 days prior to his inoculation; nor did he go out of said reser-<lb/>
vation before he fell sick with yellow fever, five days afterwards, thus confirming in<lb/>
our minds the fact that he had been infected by the mosquito bites.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll being at this time still suffering from a severe attack of the disease,<lb/>
<hi>Drs. Lazear and Agramonte decided to communicate these results to Maj. Reed</hi>, who<lb/>
was yet in Washington.</p>
<p>Before Maj. Reed's arrival in Habana, Dr. Lazear became infected with yellow<lb/>
fever, his death taking place on the 25th of September.</p>
<p>During Carroll's convalescence, the board decided that the results of the investiga-<lb/>
tion were so far sufficiently convincing to justify their presentation, in the shape of a<lb/>
preliminary note, before the coming meeting of the American Public Health Association<lb/>
at Indianapolis, Ind. (October, 1900).</p>
<p>Maj. Reed went north for this purpose, and while Carroll took a short vacation, to<lb/>
recuperate from his recent attack, Dr. Agramonte was charged with breeding and<lb/>
infecting mosquitoes, keeping them at <hi>the division laboratory, which was under his<lb/>
care in Habana</hi>, in preparation for the work which the board intended to carry out<lb/>
after the Indianapolis meeting.</p>
<p>When Maj. Reed returned from the States, moral and material aid was obtained<lb/>
from Gen. Leonard Wood, commanding the division, and we determined to carry<lb/>
out an investigation exclusively based upon the mosquito theory sustained by Finlay;<lb/>
<hi>we knew nothing of Beauperthuy then, who in 1853 had defended practically the<lb/>
same theory</hi>.</p>
<p>While the experimental station, afterward named Camp Lazear, in honor to the<lb/>
memory of our deceased colleague, was being established, the care of the mosquitoes<lb/>
and their infection by applying them to yellow-fever cases, was in the hands of Dr.<lb/>
Agramonte, <hi>at the division laboratory</hi>; when the <hi>permanent &ldquo;mosquito building&rdquo; was<lb/>
erected at Camp Lazear (Dec. 1, 1900)</hi>, these mosquitoes were turned over to Dr.<lb/>
Carroll for his care. It devolved then upon Dr. <hi>Agramonte to select the mosquitoes</hi><lb/>
from those kept by Dr. Carroll and <hi>apply them to nonimmunes, as well</hi> as to make all<lb/>
<hi>subsequent direct inoculations</hi>, and to obtain the nonimmunes (Spaniards) for the<lb/>
purpose, until the end of the work in Cuba.</p>
<p>Let me add that the best friendship existed between all the members of the board,<lb/>
and from the beginning of their work it was agreed that <hi>the honor of the results was<lb/>
to be shared by all alike, as the labor was so evenly shared. Unfortunately this has<lb/>
not been the case, let us hope through no fault of the members themselves</hi>. Drs.<lb/>
Reed and Carroll had been connected in laboratory work for several years, and Dr.<lb/>
Agramonte had also worked at the Army Medical Museum Laboratory; Drs. Lazear<lb/>
and Agramonte were classmates, having graduated from the College of Physicians and<lb/>
Surgeons, New York, in June 1892.</p>
<p>I certify to the absolute truth of the above statement.</p>
<p>In testimony whereof I affix my signature in the city of Habana, August 31, <hi>1908</hi>.</p>

He is professor of bacteriology and experimental pathology in the<lb/>

<item>5. <hi>The name of the American soldier, XY</hi>, who was the subject of<lb/>
the second experiment, <hi>was concealed at the time, because the experi-<lb/>
ment was made without military authorization</hi>. It has been recently<lb/>
ascertained to be William H. Dean, private, Troop B, Seventh Cav-<lb/>
alry. He has never received any reward. He was discharged August<lb/>
17, 1902, by reason of expiration of term of service, and there is no<lb/>
further record of him at the War Department. His residence at <lb/>
enlistment was given as <hi>Grand Rapids, Mich. His case has special<lb/>
importance as having been the first experimental case which was com-<lb/>
plete in the matter of control, for Dr. Carroll's, which came four<lb/>
days earlier, was defective, by reason of his going into the infected<lb/>
zone during the period of incubation</hi>.</item>
<item>6. John R. Kissinger, private, Hospital Corps (see p. 6, President's<lb/>
message). Kissinger volunteered for service at the beginning of the<lb/>
Spanish War in Company D, One hundred and fifty-seventh Indiana<lb/>
Volunteers, and after his discharge enlisted in the Hospital Corps.<lb/>
After the <hi>first secret experiments of the board</hi>, which included the<lb/>
cases of Dr. Carroll and Pvt. Dean, became known and the experi-<lb/>
mental camp was established and named Camp Lazear, <hi>Kissinger<lb/>
and Moran were the first to volunteer as subjects for experiment.<lb/>
Moran was first bitten, but Kissinger was the first to be attacked, on</hi><lb/>
December 8, 1900. He recovered and was afterwards promoted to<lb/>
be acting hospital steward, and discharged November 14, 1901, at<lb/>
Columbia Barracks, Cuba. It is understood that his health after-<lb/>
wards failed so that he became entirely dependent upon the labor of<lb/>
his wife for support. He was pensioned at the rate of $12 per month,<lb/>
by the act of <hi>March 2, 1907</hi>. This amount is considered quite<lb/>
inadequate either for his support or as a recognition of his services.<lb/>
A bill granting an increase to $125 per month was favorably reported<lb/>
and incorporated in <hi>Senate bill 6272</hi> and passed the Senate February<lb/>
15, 1910, but was objected to by the Committee on Pensions of the<lb/>
House of Representatives. <hi>The report of the Senate committee (No.<lb/>

<item>7. John J. Moran (see p. 6, President's message). Mr. Moran has<lb/>
never received any material reward for his most creditable services.<lb/>
After leaving Cuba he completed his education by a course of study<lb/>
at the University of Virginia, and is at present living at Panama, in<lb/>
the employ of the Isthmian Canal Commission. He is at present an<lb/>

The demonstration made by Dr. Cook and the men with him that<lb/>
yellow fever could not be transmitted by infected clothing and other<lb/>
inanimate objects was of the utmost importance to commerce and<lb/>
has immensely simplified the preventive measures to be taken against<lb/>
this disease. He was shut up in a house with infected bedding for<lb/>

<p>[Senate Report No. 574, Sixty-first Congress, second session.]</p>
<p>The Committee on Pensions, to whom was referred the bill (S. 7252) granting an<lb/>
annuity to John R. Kissinger, have examined the same and report:</p>
<p>A bill granting an increase of $125 per month to John R. Kissinger, the applicant<lb/>
herein, was favorably reported by your committee and incorporated in Senate bill<lb/>
6272 at this session and passed the Senate on February 15, 1910.</p>
<p>The Senate report No. 210, which contains a very full statement of the services of<lb/>
this soldier and the grounds upon which his right to increase of pension is recognized,<lb/>
is as follows:</p>
<p>S. 4479. John Kissinger, the claimant, was one of the bravest of soldiers who served<lb/>
in the Spanish-American War. For exhibition of moral courage his submission to<lb/>
inoculation of yellow fever seems unsurpassed. He is now a helpless paralytic,<lb/>
unable to walk, and he is totally disabled for any kind of employment, his ailment<lb/>
<hi>being myelitis, or disease of spine</hi>, and is the result of experiments made upon him<lb/>
when he volunteered to become a subject for experimental purposes in the yellow-<lb/>
fever hospital in Cuba. At the time he made the sacrifice he was a private in the<lb/>
Hospital Corps of the Army, in which he enlisted November 15, 1898. When he was<lb/>
finally discharged from the hospital, he was appointed an acting hospital steward and<lb/>
served as such until the date of his discharge, November 14, 1901. Previous to his<lb/>
enlistment he served in Company D, One hundred and fifty-seventh Indiana Volun-<lb/>
teer Infantry, from April 28, 1898, to November 1, 1898, having enlisted immediately<lb/>
at the breaking out of the war with Spain, and in response to President McKinley's<lb/>
call for troops.</p>
<p>The commission that investigated the mosquito theory of transmission of yellow<lb/>
fever in the fall of 1900 was composed of Drs. Walter Reed, James Carroll, and Jesse<lb/>
W. Lazear. From a book entitled &ldquo;Walter Reed and Yellow Fever,&rdquo; by Howard<lb/>
A. Kelly, professor of surgery of the Johns Hopkins University, published in New<lb/>
<pb n="31" id="S8220037"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
31<lb/>
York by McClure, Phillips &amp; Co., on page 139, is the following paragraph in regard<lb/>
to this soldier:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The subject of the first experiment was a young private from Ohio, named John<lb/>
R. Kissinger, who volunteered for the service, to use his own words, &lsquo;solely in the<lb/>
interest of humanity and the cause of science.&rsquo; <hi>When it became known among the<lb/>
troops that subjects were needed for experimental purposes, Kissinger, in company<lb/>
with another young private named John J. Moran, also from Ohio, volunteered their<lb/>
services. Dr. Reed talked the matter over with them</hi>, explaining fully the danger<lb/>
and suffering involved in the experiment should it be successful, and then, seeing they<lb/>
were determined, he stated that a definite money compensation would be made them.<lb/>
Both young men declined to accept it, making it, indeed their sole stipulation that<lb/>
they should receive no pecuniary reward, <hi>whereupon Maj. Reed touched his cap,<lb/>
saying respectfully, &lsquo;Gentlemen, I salute you</hi>.&rsquo; Reed's own words in his published<lb/>
account of the experiment on Kissinger are: &lsquo;In my opinion this exhibition of moral<lb/>
courage has never been surpassed in the annals of the Army of the United States.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear died of yellow fever in Cuba at that time. <hi>Dr. Carroll died later of<lb/>
disease resulting from yellow fever contracted during his experiments with that<lb/>
trouble</hi>. Dr. Walter Reed is also dead, and the widows of these three men have all<lb/>
been remembered by the Government in an annuity of $125 per month. On account<lb/>
of the death of these doctors, soldier is unable, of course, to furnish any further evi-<lb/>
dence from them, but his volunteer submission to inoculation from infected mosqui-<lb/>
toes is a matter of record in the archives of the War Department.</p>
<p>He is now receiving a pension of but $12 per month, and he can obtain no further<lb/>
relief because he is <hi>unable to furnish direct testimony tracing his present grievous<lb/>
condition back to yellow fever in the Army, although there is but little doubt that<lb/>
the relation of the cause and effect exists</hi>. Since his discharge he has never been in<lb/>
good health, which he at first attributed to slow recovery from that disease, thinking<lb/>
that with the passing of time his constitution would enable him to throw it off. He<lb/>
continued to fail, however, and is now a <hi>helpless paralytic</hi>. In the meantime he<lb/>
had married, and is now supported by his small pension and laundry work done by<lb/>
his wife and contributions to his support by a few people who appreciated his services<lb/>
to humanity.</p>
<p>A bill to grant him a pension of $30 per month passed the House during the session<lb/>
of the Fifty-ninth Congress, but by mistake the rate was cut to $12 per month, at<lb/>
which amount it was finally approved. In his present helpless condition it is believed<lb/>
that he is entitled to a highly substantial measure of relief, his disability seemingly<lb/>
being due to causes of service origin.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that a pension or annuity of $125 per month was granted to the<lb/>
widows of Drs. Lazear and Carroll, who conducted these experiments with yellow-<lb/>
fever infected mosquitoes, and who died as a result of being infected by mosquitoes,<lb/>
your committee are of the opinion that as great consideration should be given to the<lb/>
man who braved the danger and who, while he escaped with his life, is so helplessly<lb/>
crippled that he is unable to do anything to care for himself, as to the widows of Drs.<lb/>
Lazear and Carroll. Your committee therefore recommend in this case a pension<lb/>
or annuity of $125 per month.</p>
<p>The bill went to the House and was referred to the Committee on Pensions. There<lb/>
the paragraph increasing the pension to the applicant herein <hi>was objected to as carry-<lb/>
ing a rate in excess of that allowed to any other private soldier and, regarded simply as<lb/>
a pension and without distinguishing language, establishing a vexing precedent</hi>.</p>
<p>The facts in this case are exceptional and extraordinary. To meet the exceptional<lb/>
case and obviate the objections the pending bill recites the peculiar circumstances<lb/>
that distinguish the case and proposes an annuity of $125 per month, payable by the<lb/>
Secretary of War in the same manner as the same allowances are now paid to the<lb/>
widows of Drs. Carroll and Lazear. In view of the unprecedented facts in the case<lb/>
and the extraordinary services rendered by the soldier, your committee believe he<lb/>
should receive the same recognition accorded the widows heretofore mentioned. The<lb/>
bill is therefore reported back favorably with a recommendation that it pass.</p>

<byline><docAuthor>DR. WALTER REED</docAuthor>, MAJOR AND SURGEON, UNITED STATES ARMY.</byline>
<p>Whereas the Medical Society of the District of Columbia has sus-<lb/>
tained an irretrievable loss by the death of Walter Reed, who died<lb/>
at 2 p. m., November 23, 1902, from appendicitis, for which an oper-<lb/>
ation had been performed five days before:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Be it resolved</hi>,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> That in the death of Dr. Reed, the medical society<lb/>
has lost one of its most distinguished members,whose best efforts<lb/>
were always at its disposal and upon whom it had learned to rely as<lb/>
an able, calm, and accurate exponent of scientific medicine.</p>
<p>Maj. Reed was born in Gloucester County, Va., September 13,<lb/>
1851, and was a graduate of the medical department of the University<lb/>
of Virginia, 1869, and Bellevue Hospital Medical College, 1872. He<lb/>
was appointed assistant surgeon, United States Army, June 26, 1875;<lb/>
promoted assistant surgeon, with the rank of captain, June 26, 1880;<lb/>
surgeon, with rank of major, December 4, 1893, and at the time of his<lb/>
death was first on the list of majors in the Medical Department.</p>
<p>He served with distinction as medical officer at various Army<lb/>
posts in the Far West, and as his skill and devotion extended to both<lb/>
officers and enlisted men alike, he endeared himself to all classes in<lb/>
the command.</p>
<p>During his service at Fort McHenry, Md., in 1881, and again while<lb/>
attending surgeon and examiner of recruits at Baltimore, from<lb/>
October, 1890, to October, 1891, he made special studies in bacteriology<lb/>
and pathology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and after a tour of<lb/>
service at Fort Snelling and St. Paul, he was selected by the Surgeon<lb/>
General, in August, 1893, as curator of the Army Medical Museum,<lb/>
where he continued his studies which ultimately secured for him fame<lb/>
and distinction.</p>
<p>During the Spanish-American War he was president of the board<lb/>
of medical officers to investigate and report on the prevalence of<lb/>
typhoid fever in the Army, and the commission, strongly impressed<lb/>
with the agency of flies as carriers of this disease, recommended the<lb/>
collection of excreta in galvanized-iron tanks, which method was<lb/>
adopted and was followed by a cessation of the disease.</p>
<p>His greatest achievement for science and humanity was his con-<lb/>
tribution to the cause, spread, and prevention of yellow fever. Start-<lb/>
ing from Finlay's theory of the agency of the mosquito in the dis-<lb/>
semination of this disease, the commission of which Dr. Reed was the<lb/>
head made a series of painstaking experiments and demonstrated<lb/>
conclusively the causal relation of <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi> to yellow fever<lb/>
epidemics and disproved the theory that the disease could be conveyed<lb/>
in <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi>, or that it was contagious in the ordinary acceptation of the<lb/>
term.</p>

<p>The practical value of this discovery, which in point of importance<lb/>
and far-reaching beneficence ranks only second to Jenner's discovery<lb/>
of vaccination, has been proved by the complete eradication of this<lb/>
scourge from Habana.</p>
<p>Maj. Reed has demonstrated how to rid the world of yellow fever,<lb/>
but his studies as to the etiology of the disease were interrupted by<lb/>
his untimely death; he had, however, arrived at the conclusion that<lb/>
the disease was not due to Sanarelli's <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi>, but was<lb/>
probably <hi>caused by some ultramicroscopic organism</hi>. Dr. Reed was<lb/>
a clear, forceful writer and speaker; all of his facts were collected with<lb/>
the utmost care and presented in a concise, logical, and convincing<lb/>
manner, and his crowning work shows the highest degree of scientific<lb/>
accuracy, combined with calm judgment and discrimination, qualities<lb/>
which are not only of the utmost importance in searching the causes<lb/>
of epidemic diseases and tracing their progress, but which would have<lb/>
also fitted him for the highest position in his corps.</p>
<p>In every sphere of activity, whether as a medical officer, author,<lb/>
teacher, or investigator, he has acquired <hi>a distinction which rightly<lb/>
places him in the first rank of illustrious American physicians</hi>.<lb/>
His labors in behalf of science and humanity have been recognized<lb/>
by Harvard, Ann Arbor, and the <hi>American Medical Association</hi>,<lb/>
and he has borne his honors with accustomed modesty and innate<lb/>
dignity. Dr. Reed was singularly free from all mean self-interest<lb/>
and ambition, and was ever ready to give full credit to his col-<lb/>
leagues for their share of the work which made him famous. We<lb/>
have simply to recall his glowing tribute to that brave young soldier<lb/>
Kissinger, from Ohio, who on December 5, 1900, was the first to<lb/>
volunteer to be bitten by infected mosquitoes, with the only provision<lb/>
that he should receive no pecuniary reward, since as he expressed it,<lb/>
he was actuated &ldquo;solely in the interest of humanity and the cause of<lb/>
science.&rdquo; Such exhibition of moral courage, in the opinion of Dr.<lb/>
Reed, has never been surpassed in the annals of the Army of the<lb/>
United States, and <hi>we will add, could never have been inspired except<lb/>
by a man of Dr. Reed's greatness</hi>.</p>
<p>His lips are silent; no longer will the sound of his musical but<lb/>
decisive voice be heard within these walls, nor his personal mag-<lb/>
netism and discerning mind delight, instruct, and charm his listen-<lb/>
ers, but his deeds will live and his example will be an inspiration<lb/>
to the present and future generations.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed's death in the prime of life, in the zenith of his dis-<lb/>
tinguished career, is a severe blow to scientific medicine, his corps,<lb/>
and the medical profession which he adorned. This society, while<lb/>
expressing the sincerest grief at the loss of our distinguished associate,<lb/>
whose personal qualities commanded our highest friendship and<lb/>
respect, is not unmindful of the irreparable loss sustained by his<lb/>
beloved family, to whom we beg to offer our heartfelt sympathy in<lb/>
the hour of their great affliction, united with the fervent hope that<lb/>
a grateful Nation will recognize the economic value of Dr. Reed's<lb/>
discovery and make adequate provision for those who were dependent<lb/>
upon him for support.</p>

<p>MEMORIAL MEETING OF THE MEDICAL SOCIETY OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, HELD<lb/>
DECEMBER 31, 1902.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS BY SAMUEL S. ADAMS, A. M., M. D., PRESIDENT.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen: Once more we have been called together<lb/>
to pay tribute to the memory of an honored colleague, whose counsel<lb/>
we have enjoyed for nearly a decade. The possessor of a striking<lb/>
personality, unusual reasoning power, an unbiased judgment, and a<lb/>
determination to enforce his convictions, Dr. Walter Reed could not<lb/>
fail to adorn and stimulate this scientific body as well as the military<lb/>
service of the United States Army. The aged die, and we wonder not,<lb/>
believing that they have fulfilled their mission; but when a colaborer<lb/>
in the prime of life, at the height of his usefulness, is cut down before<lb/>
he has had time to enjoy the full fruition of his labors, we marvel,<lb/>
we are lost in wonder.</p>
<p>Dr. Reed was elected a &ldquo;member by invitation&rdquo; <hi>March 14, 1894</hi>.<lb/>
The preceding meeting, however, he made his first appearance in<lb/>
this society, having been invited to open the discussion on Dr.<lb/>
Kinyoun's paper, entitled &ldquo;The prevention and control of diph-<lb/>
theria.&rdquo; In reverting to this debate, we can recall his modest<lb/>
demeanor, his convincing arguments, and his power to hold his audi-<lb/>
ence throughout a lengthy presentation of the subject. He began<lb/>
by saying that his clinical experience, laboratory work in inoculating<lb/>
animals, and bacteriological studies had led him to certain ideas as<lb/>
fixed convictions:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. The Klebs-Loeffler bacillus is usually characterized by a deposit<lb/>
of false membrane in the throat and is attended by frequent fatal<lb/>
sequel&aelig;. This bacillus he believed to be the cause of true primary<lb/>
diphtheria.</item>
<item>2. That diphtheria is local in the beginning and by the production<lb/>
of virulent toxins tends to become rapidly constitutional. The bacilli<lb/>
themselves have been found in the internal organs of the human<lb/>
subject, as well as in those of animals. So that we can not any longer<lb/>
say that the bacilli remain local throughout the attack.</item>
<item>3. Diphtheria is not spread by water and food, except by milk<lb/>
and its products, which are infected in transitu. He strongly advo-<lb/>
cated the bacteriological examination in making the diagnosis.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p><hi>Two months later, in discussing tuberculosis</hi>, he dwelt upon these<lb/>
two points: &ldquo;The possibility of the transference of tuberculosis by<lb/>
vaccination; and the possibility of its transference from mother to<lb/>
child in utero.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi>January 9, 1895</hi>, in discussing diphtheria and its treatment by its<lb/>
antitoxin, he said he believed the production of antitoxin should be<lb/>
under municipal control and be tested by disinterested parties so as to<lb/>
avoid imposition by unscrupulous men whose desire is gain. He<lb/>
lived to see the enactment of a law to protect this community from<lb/>
spurious viruses. He had witnessed the wonderful immunizing<lb/>
effects of antitoxin, so advised its use as a preventive as well as a<lb/>
curative agent.</p>
<p>His masterly hand struck the death blow to the opponents of anti-<lb/>
toxin in the discussion of &ldquo;The clinical aspects of diphtheria treated<lb/>
by its antitoxin,&rdquo; <hi>December 4, 1895</hi>.</p>
<p>A clinician of wide experience and recognized ability, while dis-<lb/>
claiming any unfriendliness toward its use, had taken a decided stand<lb/>
<pb n="35" id="S8220041"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
35<lb/>
against this serum, basing his remarks upon the statistics and argu-<lb/>
ments of a distinguished English laryngologist and a well-known<lb/>
American pediatrist. It seemed as if the pendulum were swinging<lb/>
toward the opposition when Walter Reed entered the forum--majes-<lb/>
tic, <hi>fearless, determined</hi> to conquer. With keen eyes fixed on his<lb/>
principal antagonist, he hurled <hi>his weapon of defense in unmistakable<lb/>
language, when he said</hi>:</p>
<p>You are theorizing while we are dealing with facts. If another friend of antitoxin<lb/>
arises and deals it such blows as Dr. ----- has given it, the antitoxin serum will be<lb/>
slaughtered in the house of its friends.</p>
<p>In concluding his remarks, came this appeal:</p>
<p>I myself almost feel like saying, with the reader of the paper, that the failure to use<lb/>
it in a case of human <hi>diphtheria is criminal</hi>; and I beg of you, that if you have not yet<lb/>
done so, when you next stand by the bedside of your patient afflicted with this disease,<lb/>
you do not, through any fear of its peculiar action, withhold this invaluable remedy.</p>
<p>It must have been a great satisfaction to him to witness not only<lb/>
the conversion of his opponents, but the universal use of the anti-<lb/>
toxin of diphtheria.</p>
<p><hi>His paper</hi> entitled &ldquo;What credence should be given to the state-<lb/>
ments of those who claim to furnish vaccine lymph free from bac-<lb/>
teria?&rdquo; is worthy of praise. He conducted a series of experiments<lb/>
upon monkeys by vaccinating them with various vaccine matter,<lb/>
and was &ldquo;convinced that all virus contained bacteria and that<lb/>
bacteria-free lymph did not exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a singular coincidence that the <hi>last appearance of Dr. Reed</hi><lb/>
in this society was at a memorial meeting, when he eulogized as<lb/>
an author his friend and associate, Dr. W. W. Johnston.</p>
<p>The Medical Society of the District of Columbia is proud of hav-<lb/>
ing had the friendship of Walter Reed; we gloried in his achievements,<lb/>
and we now mourn the loss of a courteous, industrious, famous, and<lb/>
highly honored member.</p>
<p>HISTORICAL REMARKS, BY MEDICAL DIRECTOR R. A. MARMION, UNITED STATES NAVY.</p>
<p>Mr. President and members of the Medical Society of the District<lb/>
of Columbia: Walter Reed was born in Gloucester County, Va., on<lb/>
the 13th of September, 1851, and was the son of Rev. Lemuel<lb/>
Sutton Reed, who was for 40 years or more an eminent Methodist<lb/>
minister. In his personal appearance Walter was highly favored<lb/>
even in his youth, and to this there were added a gentleness of dis-<lb/>
position and a graciousness of manner which won for him the admira-<lb/>
tion of all who were brought in contact with him--qualities which we<lb/>
know were characteristic of him ever after. Intellectually he was,<lb/>
as a boy, precocious and devoted to study, so that at the age of 15<lb/>
he had acquired a knowledge of Latin and Greek rarely found in one<lb/>
so young. History, literature, and philosophy were also favorite<lb/>
studies, and his familiarity with them rendered him the peer of many<lb/>
who were his seniors in age by several years.</p>
<p>By a <hi>special dispensation</hi> he was matriculated in the academic de-<lb/>
partment of the University of Virginia at the age of 16. He quickly<lb/>
attained and held, throughout that first year, the highest standing in<lb/>
his classes. Owing, however, to the limited means of his father, who<lb/>
was maintaining two other sons at the same school, it became evident<lb/>
to Walter that he would not be able to carry out his original plan of<lb/>
completing the academic course; so, at the beginning of the following<lb/>
<pb n="36" id="S8220042"/>
36<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
year he began the study of medicine, and at the end of one session of<lb/>
nine months he was <hi>awarded the degree of doctor of medicine, although</hi><lb/>
he was not yet 18 years of age. This feat he accomplished in spite<lb/>
of the advice of friends who had, in advance, sought to dissuade him<lb/>
from undertaking it. His only reply to such advisers was that &ldquo;he<lb/>
did not fear the result.&rdquo; In a few months after his graduation at the<lb/>
University of Virginia he went to New York and matriculated at the<lb/>
Bellevue Medical College, and in one session acquired the degree of<lb/>
<hi>M. D.</hi> Following his graduation at Bellevue he was attached to<lb/>
various hospitals in New York and Brooklyn, conspicuously the<lb/>
Brooklyn City Hospital and the Charity Hospital on Blackwell's<lb/>
Island; at the latter he devoted himself especially to the study of the<lb/>
diseases of women and children. He was also for awhile, one of the<lb/>
physicians to the poor of New York City. During his Brooklyn life<lb/>
he had attracted the attention of Dr. Joseph Hutchinson, one of the<lb/>
most prominent medical men of that city, who urged and secured his<lb/>
appointment as one of the five inspectors of the board of health--a<lb/>
position much sought after in those days. This post he was filling<lb/>
most creditably when his twenty-first birthday dawned. Even at<lb/>
this early date, Dr. Reed had acquired a very enviable standing<lb/>
among the medical men of New York and Brooklyn, among whom<lb/>
he was especially well known for his skill as a surgeon. Within a few<lb/>
years, as we have seen, he had been holding various professional posi-<lb/>
tions of responsibility, but he could not help feeling that there was a<lb/>
point beyond which he could not go on the road toward that success<lb/>
which he coveted, without the influence of wealthy friends and of in-<lb/>
fluential social connections on the spot. <hi>Thus it was that in 1874</hi> he<lb/>
began to think seriously of entering the Medical Corps of the Army or<lb/>
of the Navy, and, by the spring of 1875, he had chosen the Army as<lb/>
the field of his future labors.</p>
<p>I can not dismiss this part of my subject without pausing for a<lb/>
moment to weigh certain characteristics of our lamented colleague<lb/>
and, first of all, I would advert to the fact that even in his boy-<lb/>
hood years there shone forth so many of the splendid traits which<lb/>
illustrated his after life; he was fired with ambition and sustained<lb/>
by an indomitable energy in his early student days which invari-<lb/>
ably brought him victory; but his innate tenderness of nature and<lb/>
his exquisite regard for the sensibilities of a disappointed contestant<lb/>
so dominated him at such times that no one ever knew him to boast<lb/>
of his victory. A deference for the opinions of others, too, was always<lb/>
a prominent characteristic; and this we have seen evinced so uni-<lb/>
formly in the discussions taking place at meetings of this society.<lb/>
And so I might go on analyzing and dwelling upon other traits,<lb/>
but the limited time prevents me.</p>
<p>Turning to the military history of Maj. Walter Reed, as borne<lb/>
upon the records of the office of the Surgeon General of the Army,<lb/>
we find that he was appointed assistant surgeon with the rank of<lb/>
first lieutenant June 26, 1875; promoted to be assistant surgeon<lb/>
with the rank of captain June 26, 1880; surgeon with rank of major<lb/>
December 4, 1893; and at the time of his death was first on the list<lb/>
of majors in the Medical Department.</p>
<p>He was on duty in the Department of the East from July 23, 1875,<lb/>
to May 21, 1876; in the Department of Arizona from June, 1876, to<lb/>
May, 1880; again in the Department of the East from September,<lb/>
<pb n="37" id="S8220043"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
37<lb/>
1880, to November, 1882. From November, 1882, to July, 1887,<lb/>
he was attached to the Department of the Platte, and from August,<lb/>
1887, to October, 1890, he was on duty at Mount Vernon Barracks,<lb/>
Ala. His next assignment was to duty in Baltimore, Md., from<lb/>
October, 1890, to October 1891, when he was transferred to the De-<lb/>
partment of Dakota, where he remained until August, 1893, when he<lb/>
was ordered to duty in the office of the Surgeon General of the Army.<lb/>
Under this assignment he was curator of the Army Medical Museum<lb/>
and member of the faculty of the Army Medical School for over nine<lb/>
years and up to the date of his death, which occurred in this city<lb/>
November 23, 1902.</p>
<p>In the meantime, too, he served, at several different periods, as<lb/>
member of the Army Medical Board in this city, was a member<lb/>
of the cholera board in July, 1898; was on detached duty making<lb/>
inspections of camps and field hospitals in August, 1898; <hi>was member<lb/>
of the typhoid fever board in August, September, and October, 1898</hi>;<lb/>
in October, 1898, he was on inspection duty at Natural Bridge, Va.,<lb/>
and again in <hi>April and May, 1899, at Puerto Principe, Cuba</hi>. In<lb/>
<hi>March and April, 1900</hi>, he was ordered to investigate and report<lb/>
upon the use of <hi>electrozone</hi> and germicides at Tampa and <hi>Habana,<lb/>
and in June and July, 1900</hi>, was a member of a board of medical<lb/>
officers at Camp Columbia, Cuba, for the purpose of scientific<lb/>
investigation with reference to infectious diseases prevalent in Cuba,<lb/>
and, from <hi>September 27</hi> to October 13, 1900, on similar duty with<lb/>
regard to yellow fever. These various assignments were of great<lb/>
importance from the standpoint of preventive medicine and did<lb/>
much to solidify the foundation on which he was destined to erect<lb/>
the structure &ldquo;more lasting than brass&rdquo; which to-day towers above<lb/>
the many works of a life full of labors for the benefit of his fellow<lb/>
man.</p>
<p>It seems to me that I can not better close this paper than by<lb/>
quoting the language of the official record of Maj. Reed as drawn<lb/>
from the files of the Surgeon General's Office:</p>
<p>Of Maj. Reed's work in the Medical Department and his scientific researches, it<lb/>
is probable a complete history can never be obtained. His eminence as a bacteri-<lb/>
ologist, and in practical hygiene as applied to military life (as a student of all forms of<lb/>
bacteria) led to his being intrusted with special investigations, which were interrupted<lb/>
by his death, and which, it is now believed, will never be completed. He was<lb/>
regarded by his associates as a man who combined an unusual degree of scientific<lb/>
accuracy with calm judgment, which rendered him invaluable in searching out the<lb/>
causes of epidemic diseases and tracing their progress.</p>
<p><hi>In 1901 he began the investigation of the cause and the prevalence of yellow fever</hi>,<lb/>
conducting his investigations at Quemados, near Habana, where he established<lb/>
headquarters and was given every facility for conducting his experiments.</p>
<p>The conditions in Cuba in <hi>1901</hi> were such as made the investigations of Maj. Reed<lb/>
and his corps of assistants of special moment. An epidemic of yellow fever existed<lb/>
despite the efforts of the sanitary experts, led by Gen. Wood, who were endeavoring<lb/>
to stamp out the disease. The houses of persons infected were subjected to rigid<lb/>
disinfection. Furniture was destroyed and every possible precaution was taken to<lb/>
prevent the spread of the disease under the old treatment. Maj. Reed became con-<lb/>
vinced that proper sanitation was not all that was needed. He believed that some<lb/>
other agency than accumulations of filth was responsible for the spread of the disease,<lb/>
and his attention was attracted to the fact that it took much longer for a house to<lb/>
become infected than the usual time of incubation. This suggested a biting insect<lb/>
as an intermediate host of the parasite, and he asked and promptly received from<lb/>
Gen. Wood permission to make experiments with mosquitoes as the conveyers of<lb/>
yellow fever, and a liberal supply of money for these experiments. It was thus<lb/>
determined beyond question that through a certain species of mosquito the yellow<lb/>
fever germ was disseminated.</p>
<pb n="38" id="S8220044"/>
<p>38<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>In recognition of this precious work the <hi>degree of master of</hi> arts<lb/>
was conferred upon <hi>Maj. Reed by the Harvard University</hi> in June,<lb/>
1902, because, as President Eliot stated when the degree was awarded,<lb/>
Maj. Reed had demonstrated how to rid the world of yellow fever.<lb/>
About the same <hi>time the degree of LL. D. was</hi> conferred upon him<lb/>
by the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>
<p>MAJ. REED AS A MEDICAL OFFICER, BY MAJ. J. R. KEAN, SURGEON, UNITED STATES<lb/>
ARMY.</p>
<p>In speaking of Dr. Reed as a medical officer we should consider<lb/>
especially that part of his career with which the members of this<lb/>
society are least familiar, namely, from his entrance into the Army<lb/>
in 1875 to his assignment to duty in Washington in 1893. With<lb/>
the latter date began his career as a scientific man, although much<lb/>
of his time during this last decade was given to examining boards<lb/>
and other work of a military rather than scientific character, and the<lb/>
race horse spent much time at the plow.</p>
<p>These 18 years of garrison duty were, we may be sure, not wasted,<lb/>
yet the official records tell but little of them. The records show 15<lb/>
changes of station (with 4 years in Arizona, 5 in the Department of<lb/>
the Platte, 2 in the Department of Dakota, 3 in the South, and 3 in<lb/>
the East). There are a few brief commendations for professional zeal<lb/>
and devotion to his patients, and that is all.</p>
<p>The work of young Army surgeons claims always little space in the<lb/>
gazettes or in the reports of military commanders, and in the seventies<lb/>
and eighties the life was certainly not stimulating to intellectual<lb/>
effort.</p>
<p>The surgeon shared with his comrades of the line the tedium of<lb/>
long marches and the monotonous sameness of Arizona summers and<lb/>
Dakota winters. And those with whom bonne camaraderie out-<lb/>
weighed studious industry shared also the afternoons of bottlepool<lb/>
and beer and the nightly seductions of draw poker. But for medical<lb/>
officers this life was redeemed by the study of our profession, which<lb/>
was then beginning to broaden out from ancient channels into the<lb/>
full flood of recent progress, and it was saved from triviality by those<lb/>
stern responsibilities of life and death which practice brings to all<lb/>
physicians. To lesser minds the limitations of such a life might have<lb/>
been narrowing, but for the eager industry and professional devotion<lb/>
of a Reed they made the roots strike deep; and when we are surprised<lb/>
at the rapid growth and splendid fruit of his career as a scientist we<lb/>
must remember that in the post surgeon's unmarked life the seed was<lb/>
germinated and the roots were firmly set. But for the opportunities<lb/>
given him by his position in the Army, however distinguished he may<lb/>
have become in other ways, it is safe to say that the work with which<lb/>
his fame will always be inseparably connected would never have<lb/>
been accomplished by him. During this long apprenticeship he<lb/>
acquired too that perfect familiarity with the conditions and limita-<lb/>
tions of Army life which, combined with his scientific knowledge and<lb/>
sound judgment, made him the best sanitary inspector in the Army<lb/>
and the court of last resort on all sanitary questions.</p>
<p>I first learned to know Dr. Reed by reputation when in the spring<lb/>
of 1888 I followed him in station at Fort Robinson, a two-battalion<lb/>
post in the northwest corner of Nebraska. I learned much of his<lb/>
devotion to his patients, and their devotion to him was equally<lb/>
<pb n="39" id="S8220045"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
39<lb/>
in evidence. The country about is thinly settled with families<lb/>
locally known as &ldquo;Grangers,&rdquo; who were attempting to support<lb/>
themselves by farming in a grazing country where the rainfall was<lb/>
not sufficient for good crops except only about one year in three.<lb/>
The crop of babies, however, never failed, and the Klebs-Loeffler<lb/>
bacillus and the pneumococcus flourished perennially in their wretched<lb/>
cabins. To Reed's tender and generous spirit the call of these poor<lb/>
people never came in vain, and the trail was never so long or the<lb/>
night so dark as to deter him. In the winter these rides were really<lb/>
dangerous and a source of much uneasiness to his family and friends<lb/>
for fear of his being overtaken by one of those blizzards in which<lb/>
the staunchest horse turns tail to the wind and the most experienced<lb/>
frontiersman can not see his way, and the danger to the lost traveler<lb/>
is greater than that of a battle.</p>
<p>Again we find him at Mount Vernon Barracks in Alabama, accord-<lb/>
ing to the official statement of his commanding officer, devoting<lb/>
himself with the same earnestness and patience to the sick of Geroni-<lb/>
mo's band of Apaches, then held there as prisoners, and to the sick<lb/>
negroes of the surrounding country, as to his own patients in the<lb/>
garrison.</p>
<p>Of the first years of his service which he spent in Arizona I gained<lb/>
some knowledge when in the summer of 1896 he came to Key West,<lb/>
my station at that time, to study the blood of variola--there being<lb/>
an epidemic of smallpox there at that time. All day he would<lb/>
sit over his microscope, but the evenings we spent on the coolest<lb/>
corner of the porch looking out at the quiet tropical sea, while he<lb/>
told reminiscences, suggested, it may be, by the heat, of his service<lb/>
at Fort Yuma and Camp Apache. These stories were full of that<lb/>
humor which was so characteristic and so pleasing a trait of his<lb/>
daily conversation, and some of these were models of the short<lb/>
story. The history of Sally Ann, a Gila monster (named after the<lb/>
two ladies of the post most conspicuous in church work), which the<lb/>
chaplain captured in his kitchen, and undertook to tame, would<lb/>
have made a perfect magazine article just as Reed told it. His<lb/>
account of his summer at Yuma, the hottest of Army posts, where<lb/>
the daily July maximum was from 112&deg; to 115&deg;, still brings back a<lb/>
clear-cut picture to my memory, and I can see him with his messmate,<lb/>
a captain of infantry, who weighed 250 pounds, and the soldier--or<lb/>
in Army parlance &ldquo;striker&rdquo;--who filled the dual r&ocirc;le of chef and<lb/>
butler. The captain, a veritable Porthos, sat down to dinner in<lb/>
two garments, with a fan, a towel to wipe his face, and near at hand<lb/>
a pitcher of the largest size full of water from the olla, for there<lb/>
was no ice. Before him was a large roast of range beef, which,<lb/>
after helping Reed, he would consume entirely and likewise empty<lb/>
the water pitcher.</p>
<p>On one occasion Reed took a leave, and, in company with another<lb/>
officer and a lady of the garrison going home, drove in an ambulance<lb/>
150 miles to the railroad. The other officer was charged with the<lb/>
commission of laying in the food for this trip of nearly a week. After<lb/>
they started they found that the provision consisted simply of crack-<lb/>
ers and sardines. Reed up to that time had never been able to eat<lb/>
sardines, but he learned on this trip. He had his share also of Indian<lb/>
campaigning, and on one occasion brought into the post a little Indian<lb/>
girl of 4 or 5, who had been so horribly burned that her people had<lb/>
<pb n="40" id="S8220046"/>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
abandoned her to die. This child he succeeded in saving and brought<lb/>
<hi>her up in his family as a nurse for his children</hi> in spite of the warning<lb/>
of that keen old Indian fighter, Gen. Crook. When she was grown,<lb/>
the savage Apache blood asserted itself, and she ran away, after<lb/>
<hi>giving evidence that 15 years of gentleness and refinement</hi> had not<lb/>
modified the cruel and deceitful character of her race.</p>
<p>Memory often holds most fast to trivial things, but they are<lb/>
usually characteristic. So, though what has come into my mind to<lb/>
tell you of our dead friend is not of weighty matters; yet they show<lb/>
the odd vicissitudes of Army life and show him as he was--the<lb/>
pleasant comrade, the eager student, and the devoted doctor, gentle,<lb/>
unselfish, modest, and brave, as the gentle and devoted ever are.<lb/>
Over this earnest spirit and the high purposes of his life played always<lb/>
a merry and kindly humor like the dancing lights and reflections from<lb/>
the surface of a deep, swift river. It was often keen, but never bitter,<lb/>
and was his most striking social characteristic, as was devotion to the<lb/>
duty which was before him the dominant feature of his professional<lb/>
life. For him, as for the great Duke--</p>
<p>
The path of duty was the way to glory.<lb/>
He that walks it only thirsting<lb/>
For the truth, and learns to deaden<lb/>
Love of self, before his journey closes<lb/>
He shall find the stubborn thistle bursting<lb/>
Into glossy purples, which outredden<lb/>
All voluptuous garden roses.<lb/>
He that ever follows her commands<lb/>
On with toil of heart and knees and hands<lb/>
Through the long gorge to the far light, has won<lb/>
His path upward and prevailed,<lb/>
Shall find the toppling crags of duty scaled<lb/>
Are close upon the shining table-lands,<lb/>
To which our God Himself is moon and sun.<lb/>
Such was he--his work is done.
</p>
<p>DR. WALTER REED AS A TEACHER, BY A. F. A. KING, A. M., M. D.</p>
<p>At the time of the organization of the United States Army Medical<lb/>
School, in 1893, Dr. Reed was appointed professor of bacteriology<lb/>
and clinical microscopy, and he continued to fill this position and<lb/>
to perform its duties most acceptably until the time of his decease,<lb/>
in November, 1902.</p>
<p>Two years after beginning his work in the Army Medical School<lb/>
he was elected professor of pathology and bacteriology in the medical<lb/>
school of the Columbian University in this city, and he continued to<lb/>
hold this position also until the end of his life.</p>
<p>If we endeavor to ascertain in a general way what are the require-<lb/>
ments necessary for anyone to become a really skilled and successful<lb/>
instructor in any department of knowledge, and then ask ourselves<lb/>
how far Prof. Reed possessed these qualifications, it will at once be<lb/>
seen that the particular attributes necessary were preeminently his<lb/>
own.</p>
<p>To teach well one must know well the subject to be taught, and,<lb/>
conversely, he who can not explain a thing clearly to somebody else<lb/>
does not usually know it well himself.</p>
<p>In the whole domain of medical science there is probably no<lb/>
subject more difficult and intricate than that of pathology, especially<lb/>
<pb n="41" id="S8220047"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
41<lb/>
when considered in relation with bacteriology, this latter being also<lb/>
a comparatively new departure, and therefore bristling with the<lb/>
unfamiliar terms of a new and labored nomenclature, as every new<lb/>
science necessarily must be.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these difficulties, Prof. Reed, with his well-<lb/>
trained mind and cultivated powers of observation, inspired, too, with<lb/>
the spirit of research and led on by the charm of discovering new<lb/>
principles and new facts, had devoted himself with so much ardor,<lb/>
earnestness, and industry to the study of his chosen sphere of thought<lb/>
that, it may be said, all difficulties had been trampled under his feet;<lb/>
that he rose, step by step, to higher and still higher planes of knowl-<lb/>
edge, until reaching an eminence where the whole subject became<lb/>
easily intelligible in one comprehensive view and where he himself<lb/>
attained a complete mastery of his favorite theme.</p>
<p>Having traversed the highways of knowledge himself he was<lb/>
fully able to lead his pupils along the same paths and perhaps point<lb/>
out to them many short cuts which were easier than the longer<lb/>
distances and more laborious journeys originally pursued by him-<lb/>
self. It should be remembered also that many of these roads were<lb/>
not always the well-traveled avenues of old lines of thought, but, on<lb/>
the contrary, entirely new, strange, and perhaps lonely ways, far out<lb/>
in the prairies of investigation, where briars of speculation, weeds<lb/>
of error, and the ignes fatui of false theories were liable to obstruct<lb/>
and mislead the honest seeker for truth. It was under these circum-<lb/>
stances that Prof. Reed became a trusted guide and counselor. In<lb/>
these trackless wastes of thought he could not easily get lost or take<lb/>
a wrong direction, for in many instances he was able to say: &ldquo;I made<lb/>
these paths myself,&rdquo; and he well knew whither they would lead.</p>
<p>The successful teacher, however, must not only possess the requi-<lb/>
site knowledge and be able to guide his pupils in the best way, and<lb/>
hold out to them the easiest method of obtaining the information for<lb/>
which they are in search, but he should also have the faculty of pre-<lb/>
senting the subject in such a manner as to hold their undivided<lb/>
interest and attention by pointing out the attractive features and<lb/>
pleasing aspects of the subject under discussion. Dreary, indeed,<lb/>
would be the road to learning were it always through thorns, thistles,<lb/>
and briars, with no flowers to charm and no vistas in the forest<lb/>
through which we might at times obtain a glimpse of pleasant scenes--<lb/>
of sunshine and beauty. Dreary, and dull too, will be the teacher<lb/>
who continues his endless monotony of tiresome propositions, with<lb/>
no touch of humor and no sparkle of wit to vary the irksomeness of<lb/>
continued effort and awaken the flagging power of a strained atten-<lb/>
tion by the pleasant diversion of an occasional happy thought.</p>
<p>In this particular again Dr. Reed was singularly fortunate. One<lb/>
of his latest admiring pupils writes me that--</p>
<p>his lectures, besides satisfying the zealous seeker for knowledge, were spiced with<lb/>
humor which was most refreshing, and which made the relation between himself<lb/>
and his students a freer and more sympathetic one.--Donnally.</p>
<p>Indeed, in whatever aspect we review Dr. Reed's work as a teacher<lb/>
and however critically we single out the several qualifications required<lb/>
for the best and most successful execution of the teaching art, we<lb/>
find Prof. Reed happily endowed in a more than usual degree with<lb/>
these special gifts and qualifications, and which he knew full well<lb/>
how to utilize to the best advantage.</p>
<pb n="42" id="S8220048"/>
<p>42<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>During the later years of Prof. Reed's work in the medical school<lb/>
of the Columbian University he was assisted by Dr. James Carroll, of<lb/>
the United States Army, who also accompanied Dr. Reed to Habana,<lb/>
and again assisted him in their well-known experiments with mos-<lb/>
quitoes and yellow fever. No one, perhaps, was better acquainted<lb/>
with Dr. Reed's methods of teaching than Dr. Carroll, who kindly<lb/>
writes me as follows:</p>
<p>Dr. Walter Reed was respected and beloved by all his pupils. Always kind and<lb/>
courteous, earnest and enthusiastic, he imbued them with the same spirit, and invari-<lb/>
ably commanded their respect and attention. A thorough master of his subject and<lb/>
of the English language, he treated the driest and most difficult topics in such a man-<lb/>
ner as to render them lucid and interesting. His marvelous accuracy and clear con-<lb/>
ception of every detail, his charming personality and polished manner, made him an<lb/>
ideal professor, of whom his students were both fond and proud. <hi>Of nervous tempera-<lb/>
ment, he was quick to note and resent the slightest laxity and inattention;</hi> and when<lb/>
it became necessary to administer a rebuke it was implied rather than given directly,<lb/>
his delicacy of feeling prompting him to soften the blow by a subtle flash of wit that<lb/>
convulsed the class and diverted attention from the culprit. The lesson was never<lb/>
forgotten by him for whom it was intended, and it was never necessary to repeat it,<lb/>
for the moral effect of the slightest manifestation of his displeasure was far greater than<lb/>
could have been the dread of any other method of reproof. So closely was he in sym-<lb/>
pathy with his class and so securely had he engrafted himself upon their affections that<lb/>
their inquiries during his illness and manifestations of grief upon his demise indicated<lb/>
the loss of a dear friend, guide, and counselor rather than a teacher of cold scientific<lb/>
facts.</p>
<p>Another pupil, Capt. J. Hamilton Stone, assistant surgeon, United<lb/>
States Army, writes me as follows:</p>
<p>As a teacher Dr. Reed always seemed to me to be, first of all, master of his theme.<lb/>
His information was so much his own--a part of him, as it were--that when it was<lb/>
given to others it flowed forth with unadulterated naturalness, and sparkled with a<lb/>
keen interest which his charming personality could not help but lend it. These<lb/>
qualities would not permit his words to fall upon deaf ears. His kindly and consid-<lb/>
erate mien, together with his universally acknowledged high scientific attainments,<lb/>
won for him both the respect and admiration of his students. His language was always<lb/>
interesting, eloquent, and well appointed. When at his best his voice would reach a<lb/>
high falsetto note, and this was his characteristic method of impressing important facts<lb/>
upon dull or indurate intellects. His students never feared him, but from the start<lb/>
regarded him with filial affection. Of patience, that special attribute of a good teacher,<lb/>
he possessed an abundance. He was constantly at the side of his pupil in the lab-<lb/>
oratory, advising, consoling, encouraging, and, above all, instructing.</p>
<p>A student of the Columbian University, <hi>Mr. H. H. Donnally</hi>,<lb/>
remarks that--</p>
<p>Dr. Reed's lectures were models of order and system. A recital of the various views<lb/>
previously held in the different branches of pathology and bacteriology always led up<lb/>
to and served to emphasize the more recent and generally accepted theories. In these<lb/>
historic reviews the student was constantly surprised at Dr. Reed's remarkable<lb/>
memory for dates and his familiarity with the host of investigators and their several<lb/>
special lines of research, not only those in this country, but others in all parts of the<lb/>
civilized world. This method of unfolding the subject historically, with a final and<lb/>
forcible exposition of the latest current views, was keenly appreciated by the students<lb/>
and gave them a broad and comprehensive picture of the whole subject, which was<lb/>
easily remembered and understood.</p>
<p>Finally, I must express my great regret that it has seldom fallen<lb/>
to my lot to hear Dr. Reed lecture, and I have never witnessed his<lb/>
demonstrations in the laboratory; hence I have supplemented my<lb/>
own remarks by quoting from others who had happily been more<lb/>
favored in these respects, and certainly no statements of mine could<lb/>
more appropriately represent the work of Prof. Reed as a teacher<lb/>
than these eloquent expressions from his own faithful and loving<lb/>
pupils.</p>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>

<p>DR. WALTER REED AS AN AUTHOR, BY CH. WARDELL STILES, PH. D., ZOOLOGIST,<lb/>
UNITED STATES PUBLIC HEALTH AND MARINE-HOSPITAL SERVICE.</p>
<p>Zoology was once facetiously defined as &ldquo;The study of the useless.&rdquo;<lb/>
This definition will doubtless appeal to many people as quite appli-<lb/>
cable; for to persons not in scientific work the practical application<lb/>
of long, detailed, and often tedious accounts of animals is not always<lb/>
evident. In defending such work, many men quote the time-honored<lb/>
expression &ldquo;Knowledge for knowledge's sake.&rdquo; But seeing little<lb/>
difference in principle between this expression and the phrase &ldquo;Money<lb/>
for money's sake,&rdquo; and not wishing to pose as a defender of the<lb/>
intellectual miser, I take great pleasure as a professional zoologist in<lb/>
acknowledging the debt which zoology owes to the medical profession<lb/>
for the practical application of zoologic knowledge to the benefit of<lb/>
mankind.</p>
<p>Zoologists have shown how important the insects are from an<lb/>
economic standpoint in making or destroying certain foods upon<lb/>
which we directly or indirectly depend for life. But it is chiefly to<lb/>
the medical profession that this world is indebted for the application<lb/>
of entomologic knowledge in connection with the transmission of the<lb/>
important infectious diseases, hence in connection with saving life.</p>
<p>Dr. Walter Reed, in whose memory we meet here this evening,<lb/>
stands out among medical authors as one who has been particu-<lb/>
larly prominent in this field of work, and though he was not a zoolo-<lb/>
gist by training, his writings in applied zoology in connection with<lb/>
yellow fever entitle him to rank as among the greatest of applied<lb/>
zoologists.</p>
<p>It was the United States Bureau of Animal Industry which first<lb/>
clearly demonstrated the great importance of arthropods as interme-<lb/>
diate hosts of epidemic diseases, and its reports on the tick (<hi rend="italic">Boophi-<lb/>
lus</hi>) as a transmitter of Texas fever of cattle will always remain classic.<lb/>
Then the writings of two English physicians, Ross and Manson,<lb/>
and of an Italian zoologist, Grassi, carried the subject further in<lb/>
connection with mosquitoes and malaria.</p>
<p>Finally, the writings of our friend Walter Reed and of his asso-<lb/>
ciates demonstrated to us the relation of mosquitoes and yellow<lb/>
fever and showed us how we could protect both life and commerce<lb/>
from this scourge.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that all three of these discoveries in applied<lb/>
zoology show certain parallels. All deal with diseases which are<lb/>
preeminently tropical or subtropical; all deal with diseases of<lb/>
unusual economic importance; and the actual positive experimental<lb/>
work upon transmission has been done chiefly by English-speaking<lb/>
investigators.</p>
<p>Might I add here, without misinterpretation, that the Texas fever<lb/>
work was done before the <hi>days of the Noble prize</hi>. The first medical<lb/>
awards of this prize of $40,000 were to Behring in recognition of<lb/>
his work for mankind in connection with diphtheria, and to Pawlow<lb/>
for his work in physiology; the next award was to Ross in recognition<lb/>
of his work for humanity in connection with malaria. <hi>Are not Reed,<lb/>
Carroll, Lazear, and Agramonte the natural candidates for the next<lb/>
award because of their work for mankind in connection with</hi> yellow<lb/>
fever, and in case the conditions of the grant permit it, should not<lb/>
each of the widows of two of these men receive the share which<lb/>
would have gone to her husband?</p>
<pb n="44" id="S8220050"/>
<p>44<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>Our friend, Dr. Reed, was not what would be called a prolific<lb/>
writer. His numerous routine duties prevented him from furnish-<lb/>
ing the manuscript which we had a right to expect from a man of<lb/>
his ability. Still, beside short remarks in society discussions, his<lb/>
bibliography contains <hi>27 original articles all printed between 1892<lb/>
and 1902</hi>. Ten of these articles dealt with yellow fever, three or<lb/>
four with typhoid, two each with malaria and erysipelas, and one<lb/>
each with cholera, pneumonia, trikresol, vaccine, artificial immunity<lb/>
against vaccination, am&oelig;boid bodies in the blood of vaccinated<lb/>
monkeys and children and in variola, formaldehyde, splenic leukemia,<lb/>
and electrozone. All were in English, and although they were all<lb/>
official Government work, it is a striking fact that only five, so far<lb/>
as I have been able to find, were published by the Government.</p>
<p>Regarding the general style of the articles, there are three points<lb/>
in particular which are striking: First, the attention given to details<lb/>
immediately reminds us of the writings of Dr. Theobald Smith of<lb/>
Harvard University; second, the directness of diction immediately<lb/>
reminds us of Dr. J. McKeen Cattell, professor of experimental<lb/>
psychology, Columbia University. In fact, one of the characteristics<lb/>
for which Dr. Reed was noted among his friends was the absolutely<lb/>
straight line of his thoughts and the orderly, lucid, and logical devel-<lb/>
opment of his subject. Third, Dr. Reed was of a judicial tempera-<lb/>
ment, and the judicial manner in which he handled his subject, even<lb/>
in controversy, forcibly reminds us of the same prominent character-<lb/>
istic in Prof. William H. Welch of Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>In forecasting the time of the influence of Dr. Reed's writings, it is<lb/>
clear that his articles on yellow fever will far outlive his papers on<lb/>
other subjects. His other writings will be known to men only in<lb/>
certain lines of medical work, but his papers on yellow fever will be<lb/>
known directly or indirectly to both physicians and zoologists, and to<lb/>
both professional men and business men. They will be quoted for<lb/>
decades to come, both by Government officials and by private practi-<lb/>
tioners, and they will be one of the most important factors in deter-<lb/>
mining the future policy of civilized nations in dealing with yellow<lb/>
fever, a disease which we dreaded only a few years ago, but now one<lb/>
which, thanks to the work of Reed and his colleagues, will soon be<lb/>
little more than a medical curiosity.</p>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>DR. REED'S WORK IN CUBA, BY MAJ. GEN. LEONARD WOOD, UNITED STATES ARMY.</p>
<p>[Abstract.]</p>
<p>The work of Dr. Walter Reed is the most important work in the<lb/>
way of medical research and discovery which has been accomplished<lb/>
by any one who has lived in this hemisphere. There is no other<lb/>
medical discovery to which it can be compared, unless it be that of<lb/>
an&aelig;sthesia. The results to humanity are incalculable and far-reach-<lb/>
ing. It is safe to say that this discovery has resulted in saving each<lb/>
year more lives than were lost in the war with Spain, and in a saving<lb/>
to commerce, and especially to the southern portion of our country,<lb/>
of an amount equal to the cost of the war with Spain.</p>
<p>The following letters and telegrams were received:</p>

<hi rend="italic">President District Medical Society</hi>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR DR. ADAMS: I regret exceedingly that an engagement made some time<lb/>
since, and from which I can not excuse myself, will prevent me from attending the<lb/>
Reed memorial meeting on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>No one appreciates more deeply than I do the loss to scientific medicine and to the<lb/>
medical corps of the army caused by Maj. Reed's death. His scientific work was<lb/>
eminently fruitful and far-reaching in its results. As the head of the medical corps<lb/>
during nine years of his most useful work, <hi>which was prosecuted under my general<lb/>
direction</hi>, I am of course entirely familiar with the results accomplished.</p>
<p>Maj. Reed was endowed by nature and by training with the essential qualifications<lb/>
for engaging in research work in the special field to which he devoted his talents and<lb/>
his energies. Conservative, painstaking, thorough, persevering, and ready in resources,<lb/>
he acquitted himself with credit in every task assigned to him, and has achieved<lb/>
great and deserved distinction by his successful demonstration of the method by which<lb/>
yellow fever is transmitted from man to man. In addition to this, he was a modest<lb/>
and courteous gentleman, who attracted all of those who came in contact with him.<lb/>
His death came to me, as to his other numerous friends, as a great personal grief and<lb/>
irreparable loss.</p>
<p>Very truly, yours,<lb/>
GEO. M. <hi>STERNBERG</hi>.</p>

<p>BALTIMORE, <hi rend="italic">December 30, 1902</hi>.</p>
<p>DEAR DR. ADAMS: I have to leave unexpectedly to-day for Canada. Please<lb/>
express my regrets that I can not be at the memorial meeting to Reed.</p>
<p>With kind regards, sincerely yours,<lb/>
WM. OSLER.</p>

<p>Greatly regret I can not attend the meeting to-night in honor of Dr. Reed, whose<lb/>
friendship I prized, whose character I admired, and whose contribution to science and<lb/>
country can not be measured.</p>

<p>MY DEAR DR. NASH: As you may know by this time, I have been absent from the<lb/>
city for a month and returned Saturday. On opening my mail to-day I find your<lb/>
note of December 9, and I wish to express my great regret that I could not have been<lb/>
here to accept the honor which was conferred upon me of responding at a meeting<lb/>
held in memory of Dr. Reed. It would have been a great privilege to have taken part<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
47<lb/>
in that meeting, and of all the things which I have missed by being away one month<lb/>
I regret this more than any other.</p>
<p>I had, during his life, the highest regard for Dr. Reed as a scientist, and, more than<lb/>
that, I had the warmest feeling of friendship toward him, although we were by no means<lb/>
intimate, and certainly his death was a blow to science and the whole governmental<lb/>
service.</p>
<p>I had a conviction that in the near future the service of which I have charge would<lb/>
find a way of having some official connection with Dr. Reed in his great work, and that<lb/>
through him the bond of union between the medical services of the Government<lb/>
would be materially strengthened.</p>
<p>I have learned that Dr. Stiles took the place which was intended for myself, and<lb/>
I am much gratified that he did.</p>
<p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
<p><hi>WALTER WYMAN</hi>.</p>

<head>VALUE OF DR. REED'S WORK AND EXPRESSION OF APPRE-<lb/>
CIATION.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></head>
<p>Popular appreciation of the value of the work of the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Commission has been singularly slow and imperfect. While nearly<lb/>
every educated person in the United States is familiar with the name<lb/>
and work of a distinguished Austrian surgeon who has recently<lb/>
demonstrated in this country an operation for the cure of a rather<lb/>
rare deformity in children, only a small fraction of them know any-<lb/>
thing of Walter Reed, the <hi>conqueror of the &ldquo;yellow plague.&rdquo;</hi> And<lb/>
yet distinguished men have not been silent in regard to him. Gen.<lb/>
Leonard Wood said, in a recent address at a memorial meeting of<lb/>
scientific men held in honor of his memory in Washington:</p>
<p>I know of no other man on this side of the world who has done so much for humanity<lb/>
as Dr. Reed. His discovery results in the saving of more lives annually than were<lb/>
lost in the Cuban war, and saves the commercial interests of the world a greater<lb/>
financial loss each year than the cost of the Cuban war. He came to Cuba at a time<lb/>
when one-third of the officers of my staff died of yellow fever, and we were dis-<lb/>
couraged at the failure of our efforts to control the disease. In the months when<lb/>
the disease was ordinarily worst the disease was checked and driven from Habana.<lb/>
That was the first time in nearly 200 years that the city had been rid of it. The<lb/>
value of his discovery can not be appreciated by persons who are not familiar with<lb/>
the conditions of tropical countries. Hereafter it will never be possible for yellow<lb/>
fever to gain such headway that quarantine will exist from the mouth of the Poto-<lb/>
mac to the mouth of the Rio Grande. Future generations will appreciate fully the<lb/>
value of Dr. Reed's services. His was the originating, directing, and controlling<lb/>
mind in this work, and the others were assistants only.</p>
<p>In a letter dated November 24 General Wood said:</p>
<p>To Maj. Reed belongs the honor of having led in the greatest medical work of modern<lb/>
times, and the results he accomplished will live for all time.</p>
<p>Prof. William H. Welch, of Johns Hopkins, said in a letter to the<lb/>
Secretary of War:</p>
<p>Dr. Reed's researches in yellow fever are by far the most important contributions<lb/>
to science which have ever come from an Army surgeon. In my judgment, they are<lb/>
the most valuable contributions to medicine and public hygiene which have ever<lb/>
been made in this country with the exception of the discovery of an&aelig;sthesia. They<lb/>
have led and will lead to the saving of untold thousands of lives. I am in a position<lb/>
to know that the credit for the original ideas embodied in this work belongs wholly<lb/>
to Maj. Reed. Such work, if done in Europe, would receive substantial recognition<lb/>
from the Government.</p>
<p>He was last year given the degree of LL. D. by the University of<lb/>
Michigan, and the degree of M. A. by Harvard University. In con-<lb/>
ferring, the language used by President Eliot was:</p>
<p>Walter Reed, graduate of medicine of the University of Virginia, the Army surgeon<lb/>
who planned and directed in Cuba the experiments which have given man control<lb/>
over that fearful scourge, yellow fever.</p>

<p>Precedents are abundant for State aid to public benefactors and<lb/>
their families. The English Government a century ago, when the<lb/>
purchasing value of money was far greater than at present, gave to<lb/>
Jenner, the discoverer of vaccination, grants amounting to &pound;30,000.<lb/>
He also received &pound;7,383 from a subscription in India.</p>
<p>Pasteur, the founder of the science of bacteriology, besides numer-<lb/>
ous honors and decorations and money donations from other sources,<lb/>
received from the French Government a pension of 12,000 francs.</p>
<p>Lister, the originator of antiseptic surgery, has, besides numerous<lb/>
honors and decorations, been successively knighted and elevated to<lb/>
the peerage.</p>
<p>In this country a bill to donate $100,000 to the discoverer of an&aelig;s-<lb/>
thesia was twice passed by the Senate (in 1853 and 1854), but failed<lb/>
in the House, probably because of the uncertainty as to which of the<lb/>
rival claimants was entitled to the credit of that discovery.</p>
<p>The resolutions of various scientific and professional societies are<lb/>
appended as an indication of the standing which Dr. Reed occupied in<lb/>
the scientific world at the time of his death.</p>
<p>The following <hi>editorial</hi> from a prominent medical journal, <hi>American<lb/>
Medicine,</hi> is also quoted on account of its pertinence to the question:</p>
<p>DUE REWARDS FOR SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS.</p>
<p>The recent death of Maj. Walter Reed directs attention to the self-sacrifice of the<lb/>
medical investigator and the inadequacy of the recognition which is attainable in<lb/>
America by these heroes of science. His demise deprives the country of a citizen<lb/>
whose public spirit, devotion to duty, and splendid achievements justly entitle him<lb/>
to an enduring testimonial. His scientific career, strictly speaking, began about<lb/>
1890, when, through the stimulating influence of his illustrious teacher, Dr. Welch,<lb/>
of Johns Hopkins, his interest was awakened in the intimate nature and underlying<lb/>
causes of disease, and he took up the special study of pathology and bacteriology.<lb/>
With rare native intelligence, indefatigable industry, high ideals, broad sympathies,<lb/>
and a personality that attracted all who came in contact with him, he soon distin-<lb/>
guished himself as a trustworthy, independent investigator, and entered upon a work<lb/>
that was to become a triumph for scientific medicine and a blessing to humanity.<lb/>
Notwithstanding his manifold duties as curator of the Army Medical Museum, Reed<lb/>
never lost his love for pure medical investigation, and was a frequent contributor to<lb/>
medical literature. Yet while his contributions in general to scientific medicine are<lb/>
uniformly as good as the best, they are insignificant when compared with the great<lb/>
work upon yellow fever with which his name will ever be inseparably associated.<lb/>
<hi>His was the master mind and he the guiding spirit in an investigation whereby</hi> mul-<lb/>
titudes of lives have been saved, a pestilential malady robbed of its mysteries and<lb/>
terrors, and an annual expenditure of millions of money shown to be in large part,<lb/>
if not entirely, needless. As has been said, his work &ldquo;means to the United States for<lb/>
the future a saving in life and treasure that is cheaply paid for by the whole cost of<lb/>
the Spanish-American War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other countries a man who had done such a work as Reed would at once receive<lb/>
office, honors, and financially security. In ours we leave him unrewarded, to work<lb/>
out his life, to die early, perhaps, and then we offer his family a sum as a pension<lb/>
small beyond ridicule. We appeal to Congress to demonstrate the nation's gratitude<lb/>
in this case. It should act promptly and in a manner commensurate with the mag-<lb/>
nificient public service rendered by our colleague. This, we are sure, is the wish of<lb/>
everyone conversant with what he has done.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That the New York Academy of Medicine records its sense of the great-<lb/>
ness of the loss to science and to mankind and its sympathy with the friends and<lb/>
relatives of the deceased.</p>
<p>The following minutes and resolutions were adopted at a special<lb/>
meeting of the faculty of the medical department of the Columbian<lb/>
University:</p>
<p>The sudden and unexpected demise of our esteemed friend and colleague, Maj.<lb/>
Walter Reed, United States Army, professor of bacteriology and pathology in the<lb/>
medical school of the Columbian University, is an event that brings to us the most<lb/>
acute regret and overwhelming sorrow.</p>
<p>Taken from us in the prime of manhood and in the zenith of his professional use-<lb/>
fulness, at a time when the medical profession and humanity at large were prepared<lb/>
to do him homage for his great work in demonstrating the method of exterminating<lb/>
yellow fever by protection from inoculating mosquitoes and by which that fatal<lb/>
disease has been abolished from some of its most malignant haunts--at a time, too,<lb/>
when his relations with the faculty and students of the Columbian University had<lb/>
become securely united by bonds of mutual affection and esteem--under these cir-<lb/>
cumstances it is with a most earnest and sincere feeling that we, the medical faculty<lb/>
of the Columbian University, hereby desire to express our unreserved admiration for<lb/>
the work, life, and character of Prof. Reed, both as a physician, a teacher, a trusted<lb/>
friend, and a man of science. In testimony whereof, it is hereby</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That the foregoing note be recorded in the permanent archives of the<lb/>
faculty; that a copy of the same be given to the press for publication and also for-<lb/>
warded to the family of Dr. Reed as an evidence of our sympathy for them in their<lb/>
great sorrow.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That, as a further mark of respect for our lamented colleague, the exercises<lb/>
of the medical school be suspended and that the students and faculty attend in a<lb/>
body his funeral obsequies.</p>
<p>The following resolutions were adopted by the medical faculty of<lb/>
the University of Virginia December 8, 1902, and by them reported to<lb/>
the general faculty, which heartily concurred in this expression of<lb/>
regard for the memory of Dr. Reed, of admiration for his work, and<lb/>
of sympathy for his family:</p>
<p>The medical faculty of the University of Virginia have heard with deep sorrow<lb/>
of the death of Maj. Walter Reed, professor of bacteriology and pathology in the<lb/>
Army Medical School, and distinguished graduate of this medical department.</p>
<p>His masterly investigation of the causes of the outbreaks of typhoid fever in the<lb/>
United States Army during the Spanish-American War, and especially his work<lb/>
furnishing conclusive proof of the conveyance of yellow fever by the mosquito, entitle<lb/>
him to a preeminent place amongst scientists and sanitarians and will prove of inesti-<lb/>
mable service to mankind.</p>
<p>As an alumnus he was true and loyal, manifesting on every appropriate occasion<lb/>
his continued interest in the university, upon which he had reflected great credit.</p>
<p>In testimony of our high appreciation of his character and achievements it is hereby<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That the foregoing note be spread upon our minutes and a copy be for-<lb/>
warded to the family of Dr. Reed as an evidence of our sympathy for them in their<lb/>
great sorrow.</p>
<p>RESOLUTIONS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION <hi>FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE</hi>.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>. That the American Association for the Advancement of Science hereby<lb/>
records its sense of the great loss sustained by science in the death of Maj. Walter<lb/>
Reed, surgeon in the United States Army, and its appreciation of the far-reaching<lb/>
and invaluable services which he has rendered to humanity. By solving the problem<lb/>
of the mode of spread of yellow fever, Maj. Reed not only made a great contribution<lb/>
to science, but at the same time conferred inestimable benefits upon his country and<lb/>
upon mankind. To have discovered and demonstrated the methods, which have<lb/>
already been successfully tested in Cuba, of eradicating a widespread and terrible<lb/>
pestilence, is a benefaction of imperishable renown, of incalculable value in the sav-<lb/>
ing of human lives, of vast importance to commercial interests, and deserving the<lb/>

<hi>a suitable and permanent memorial of this great benefactor of his race may be secured</hi>.<lb/>
This committee shall be authorized to prepare and publish a statement of the services<lb/>
of the late Maj. Reed in discovering the mode by which yellow fever may be exter-<lb/>

<p>The following resolution was adopted at the meeting of the <hi>Ameri-<lb/>
can Medical Association at Saratoga</hi>, N. Y., on <hi>June 11, 1902</hi>:</p>
<p>Whereas the members of the American Medical Association believe that the recent<lb/>
work of the United States Army surgeons in Cuba in relation to the discovery of the<lb/>
method of transmission of yellow fever is of such magnitude and far-reaching benefi-<lb/>
cence as to rank only second with Jenner's discovery of vaccination; and</p>
<p>Whereas the practical value of this discovery has been proven by the complete<lb/>
eradication of this scourge from Habana:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That the <hi>thanks of this association</hi> be tendered the gentlemen who<lb/>
accomplished this brilliant result, and particularly to Drs. Walter Reed, James Car-<lb/>

PRELIMINARY NOTE.</head>
<byline>By <docAuthor>WALTER REED</docAuthor>, M. D., Surgeon, United States Army, and JAMES CARROLL, M. D.,<lb/>
Acting Assistant Surgeon, United States Army.</byline>
<p>[Reprinted from the Medical News, April <hi>29, 1899</hi>.]</p>
<p>In the course of a comparative study of <hi rend="italic">Bacillus x</hi> (Sternberg) and<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> (Sanarelli) which has engaged our attention as<lb/>
opportunity would permit during the past 18 months, we have had<lb/>
occasion to observe the effect produced by the intravenous injection<lb/>
in dogs of other micro-organisms, such as the <hi rend="italic">Bacillus coli communis</hi><lb/>
and the <hi rend="italic">Bacillus choler&aelig; suis</hi>. Without entering into details in this<lb/>
preliminary note we may state that the same clinical symptoms,<lb/>
viz, vomiting, increased action of the bowels, and profound prostra-<lb/>
tion, which are produced in dogs by the intravenous injection of <hi rend="italic">B.<lb/>
icteroides</hi>, are also brought about by a like inoculation of the hog-<lb/>
cholera bacillus. When death occurs, the stomach contains a con-<lb/>
siderable quantity of fluid blood and extensive hemorrhagic lesions<lb/>
are present in the small intestine. We have not found fatty degenera-<lb/>
tion of the liver, since our dogs, few in number, injected with the hog-<lb/>
cholera bacillus, have died too early for this change to occur. We<lb/>
have also failed to discover any fatty degeneration in the liver of dogs<lb/>
that have died within a few days after the intravenous injection of<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>. This change has only been met with in two instances,<lb/>

with <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>. In neither of these cases, however, was the degree<lb/>
of fatty degeneration at all comparable with that present in the<lb/>
human liver in yellow fever.</p>
<p>In addition to the experiments upon dogs, we have compared the<lb/>
course of the infection and the lesions produced in guinea pigs and<lb/>
rabbits inoculated with small quantities of <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B. choler&aelig;<lb/>

obtained. The same cyclical course of the infection described by<lb/>
Sanarelli for guinea pigs inoculated with <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> is seen in these<lb/>
animals when injected with like quantities of <hi rend="italic">B. choler&aelig; suis</hi>. The<lb/>
greater susceptibility and shorter course of the infection in rabbits<lb/>
applies equally to both micro-organisms. Theobald Smith has called<lb/>
attention to the extreme susceptibility of these animals to inoculation<lb/>
with minute quantities of the hog-cholera bacillus.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> We have suc-</p>

<p>ceeded in killing rabbits with 1&sol;1000000 c.c. <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> injected sub-<lb/>
cutaneously. The lesions produced in rabbits and guinea pigs inocu-<lb/>
lated with <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> and the hog-cholera bacillus are practically<lb/>
the same, the most constant change consisting of multiple necroses in<lb/>
the liver. Sanarelli does not appear to have made any mention of<lb/>
this most striking lesion. We have found these punctate necroses of<lb/>
the liver especially prominent in guinea pigs that have survived the<lb/>
inoculation more than five days.</p>
<p>Observations have shown that pigeons are not very susceptible to<lb/>
inoculation with the hog-cholera bacillus. We have also found these<lb/>
birds to be tolerably resistant to infection with <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>. A fatal<lb/>
result has been produced by injecting 3 c.c. of bouillon culture into<lb/>
the breast muscle. Hemorrhage, swelling, and extensive necrosis of<lb/>
the muscle are present, under these circumstances, as has been<lb/>
described by Welch and Clement, for the hog-cholera bacillus.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>
<p>We desire also to record in this preliminary note that <hi rend="italic">Bacillus<lb/>
icteroides</hi>, when fed to young hogs, produces an acute infection which<lb/>
may be followed by a fatal result, and that the chief lesion is confined<lb/>
to the large intestine. This lesion consists of an inflammation of the<lb/>
mucous membrane accompanied by fibrinous exudate, together with<lb/>
numerous small and large superficial ulcerations affecting the colon<lb/>
and cecum. These ulcerated areas are covered by an abundant, thick,<lb/>
bile-stained exudate. The &ldquo;cork lining&rdquo; appearance mentioned by<lb/>
Smith would apply to the description of the necrosed intestinal<lb/>
mucosa. A portion of the viscera of a young hog that had been fed<lb/>
with 25 c.c. of a 24-hour bouillon culture of Sanarelli's bacillus and<lb/>
which had died on the sixth day of the disease was fed to a second<lb/>
animal. The latter after exhibiting symptoms of sickness, such as<lb/>
fever, shiverings, and loss of appetite, for a few days appeared to have<lb/>
fully recovered from the inoculation. It was killed on the eighteenth<lb/>
day. At autopsy numerous ulcers in various stages of cicatrization<lb/>
were found in the large intestine.</p>
<p>In another animal which died on the twelfth day after being<lb/>
fed 15 c.c. of a 24-hour bouillon culture of <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> we found<lb/>
erosions upon the tongue, a well marked diphtheritic inflammation<lb/>
of the lining membrane of the esophagus from pharynx to stomach,<lb/>
involving the latter; eroded ulcers with hemorrhagic bases upon the<lb/>
gastric mucosa; superficial erosions and circumscribed ulcers, bearing<lb/>
a yellowish slough, in the small intestine and cecum; and, in addition,<lb/>
there were several hundred distinctly raised, neoplasmic, button-like<lb/>
elevations of about the size of a small split pea beneath the mucous<lb/>
membrane of the large bowel. A few of these showed a small, super-<lb/>
ficial, centrally situated spot of necrosis. The mucous membrane of<lb/>
the gall-bladder was the seat of a well marked necrotic inflammation,<lb/>
and there was also inflammation and erosion of the mucous membrane<lb/>
of the prepuce, which was distended with a dirty, yellowish-colored<lb/>
fluid.</p>
<p><hi>As regards the morphologic and biologic characters of <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi><lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">B. choler&aelig; suis</hi> we have been unable to observe differences other<lb/>
than may be met with in varieties of the same species</hi>. Both are<lb/>
small, quite actively motile, nonliquefying bacilli whose slow rate<lb/>
of growth is the same in bouillon and in gelatin; likewise on agar,</p>

<p>potato, and in litmus milk the growth presents the same appear-<lb/>
ances. Milk is not coagulated by either of these bacilli.</p>
<p>The action of <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B. choler&aelig; suis</hi> upon the three sugars<lb/>
has been the same in our hands. Both ferment glucose. If the<lb/>
bouillon is free from muscle glucose no fermentation takes place in<lb/>
lactose or saccharose bouillon. Exceptionally we have recorded a<lb/>
very slight fermentation of saccharose with both organisms. Both<lb/>
of these bacilli, when cultivated in Dunham's solution, give a faint<lb/>
indol reaction.</p>
<p>We desire further to record the marked agglutinative reaction<lb/>
exhibited toward the hog-cholera bacillus by the serum of an animal<lb/>
immunized with <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>. <hi>As long ago as May, 1898, we had<lb/>
observed that the blood serum of a dog which was being immunized<lb/>
with <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> would in dilutions of 1 to 5,000 promptly arrest<lb/>
motility and agglutinate the hog-cholera bacillus</hi>. After testing<lb/>
various dilutions of this serum from 1 to 100 to 1 to 5,000 we could<lb/>
observe no difference in its agglutinative reaction upon <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi><lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">B. choler&aelig; suis</hi>. We have recently obtained, through the kind-<lb/>
ness of Surg. Gen. Sternberg, a specimen of Sanarelli's icteroides<lb/>
serum from Rio Janeiro, which, in dilutions of 1 to 120,000 promptly<lb/>
arrests the motility and agglutinates bacillus icteroides. In the<lb/>
same dilution this serum immediately arrests the motility of the hog-<lb/>
cholera bacillus, but does not bring about agglutination of the bacilli<lb/>
until at the end of about three hours. In a dilution of 1 to 30,000<lb/>
agglutination commences within ten minutes and is complete at the<lb/>
end of one hour. The groups of bacilli are smaller than occurs with<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>.</p>
<p><hi>In rejecting <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> as the specific cause of yellow fever Novy<lb/>
emphasizes the extreme resistance of this bacillus to low temperatures</hi>.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi><lb/>
We have found Sanarelli's bacillus to preserve its vitality and viru-<lb/>
lency after twenty days' continuous freezing at -- 10&deg;C. (14&deg;F.). That<lb/>
the hogcholera bacillus is also quite resistant to low temperatures has<lb/>
been proven by the observations of Smith, and by the fact of its<lb/>
survival, notwithstanding the extreme severity of winter, in our<lb/>
Northwestern States.</p>
<p>Putting together, therefore, the remarkable cultural resemblances<lb/>
of these two bacilli, and the similarity of their pathogenic action as<lb/>
shown in guinea-pigs, rabbits, pigeons, dogs, and hogs, we venture<lb/>
to express the opinion that <hi>bacillus icteroides (Sanarelli) is a variety<lb/>
of the hog-cholera bacillus, and that it should be considered only as<lb/>
a secondary invader in yellow fever. We find that bacillus x (Stern-<lb/>
berg) presents marked differences from the foregoing micro-organisms</hi>,<lb/>
both as regards its biologic characters as well as its pathogenic action<lb/>
toward animals. Reserving for future publication a more detailed<lb/>
description of our observations, it will suffice to here state our opinion<lb/>
that <hi>bacillus x should be placed with the colon group</hi>.</p>

<p>The writers, constituting a board of medical officers convened &ldquo;for<lb/>
the purpose of pursuing scientific investigations with reference to the<lb/>
acute infectious diseases prevalent on the Island of Cuba,&rdquo; <hi>arrived<lb/>
at our station, Columbia Barracks, Quemados, Cuba, on June 25 of</hi><lb/>
the present year, and proceeded, under <hi>written instructions</hi> from the<lb/>
Surgeon General of the Army, to &ldquo;give special attention to questions<lb/>
relating to the etiology and prevention of yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of its members (Agramonte and Lazear) were stationed on the<lb/>
Island of Cuba, the former in Habana, and the latter at Columbia<lb/>
Barracks, and <hi>were already pursuing investigations</hi> relating to the<lb/>
etiology of this disease.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the purposes of this board, an <hi>epidemic of yellow</hi><lb/>
fever was prevailing in the adjacent town of Quemados, Cuba, at the<lb/>
time of our arrival, thus furnishing us an opportunity for clinical<lb/>
observations and for bacteriological and pathological work. The<lb/>
results already obtained, we believe, warrant the publication at this<lb/>
time of a preliminary note. <hi>A more detailed account of our observa-</hi><lb/>
tions will be submitted to Surgeon General Sternberg in a future<lb/>
report.</p>
<p>The first part of this preliminary note will deal with the results of<lb/>
<hi>blood cultures during life and of cultures taken from yellow fever<lb/>
cadavers</hi>, reserving for the second part a consideration of the<lb/>
mosquito as instrumental in the propagation of yellow fever, with<lb/>
observations based on the biting of nonimmune human beings by<lb/>
mosquitoes which had fed on patients sick with yellow fever, at<lb/>
various intervals prior to the biting.</p>
<p>In prosecuting the first part of our work, <hi>we isolated a variety of<lb/>
bacteria</hi>, but of these we do not propose to speak at present. It will<lb/>
suffice for our purpose if we state the results as regards the finding of<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">bacillus icteroides</hi>, leaving the mention of other bacteria to our detailed<lb/>
report.</p>
<p><hi>The cases studied during the Quemados epidemic</hi> had been diag-<lb/>
nosed by a board of physicians selected largely by reason of their<lb/>
familiarity with yellow fever. This board consisted of Drs. Nicola<lb/>
Silverio, Manuel Herera, <hi>Eduardo Angles</hi>, and Acting Asst. Surgs.<lb/>
Roger P. Ames and Jesse W. Lazear, United States Army.</p>
<p><hi>Those studied in Habana were patients in Las Animas Hospital</hi><lb/>
and had been diagnosed as such by a board of distinguished practi-<lb/>
tioners of that city.</p>
<p>An examination of Table I will show the character of the attacks.</p>
<p>The milder cases studied, few in number, were attended by jaundice<lb/>

<p>I. BACILLUS ICTEROIDES (SANARELLI) AS THE CAUSE OF YELLOW<lb/>
FEVER.</p>
<p>The claim of Sanarelli for the specific character of <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> as<lb/>
the causative agent in yellow fever has excited <hi>such wide attention</hi><lb/>
since the publication of his observations that it <hi>seemed to us of the<lb/>
first importance</hi> to give our <hi>undivided attention</hi> to the isolation of<lb/>
this microorganism from the blood of those sick with yellow fever<lb/>
and from the blood and organs of yellow-fever cadavers.</p>
<p>(A) CULTURES TAKEN FROM THE BLOOD DURING LIFE.</p>
<p>The method followed was that ordinarily used in an attempt to<lb/>
isolate bacteria from the circulating blood, viz, from a vein at the<lb/>
bend of the elbow a sufficient quantity of blood was taken with a<lb/>
hypodermic syringe, made sterile by boiling, and after careful cleans-<lb/>
ing of the skin with soap and water, followed by equal parts of abso-<lb/>
lute alcohol and ether, and 1--2000 bichloride solution.</p>
<p>Exceptionally, the blood withdrawn was plated on agar, but as a<lb/>
rule it was immediately transferred to sterile bouillon tubes (10 c. c.)<lb/>
in quantities of 0.5 c. c. to each of several tubes. These were then<lb/>
incubated at 35&deg; to 37&deg; C. for a period of one week. They were<lb/>
examined daily, and if growth was observed plates in agar or gelatine,<lb/>
or both, were made and the colonies carefully studied by transference<lb/>
to ordinary laboratory media.</p>
<p><hi>Eighteen cases</hi> have thus been carefully studied; of these 11<lb/>
were designated as &ldquo;severe&rdquo; cases of yellow fever, with 4 deaths; 3 as<lb/>
&ldquo;well-marked&rdquo; cases, with no deaths; and 4 as &ldquo;mild&rdquo; cases, with<lb/>
no deaths.</p>
<p>From these <hi>18 cases</hi> blood cultures were made, as shown in the<lb/>
following table:</p>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>It will be seen that of 48 separate cultures made from the blood on<lb/>
various days of the disease and representing 115 bouillon inoculations<lb/>
and 18 agar plates, we failed of find <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> in any of our<lb/>
tubes or plates.</p>
<p>The results of cultures taken <hi>in 18<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> cases</hi> of unmistakable yellow<lb/>
fever, on various days of the disease and <hi>in some cases on every day<lb/>
from the onset to death</hi> or recovery, would seem to exclude the<lb/>
presence of <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> in the blood of these cases during life.</p>
<p>It will therefore be seen that while <hi>Wasdin and Geddings</hi> taking<lb/>
cultures from the ear lobe (Report on the Cause of Yellow Fever,<lb/>
1899), record that &ldquo;in the blood of yellow-fever cases extracted<lb/>
during life <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> has been found in 13 of the 14 cases,<lb/>
with 1 negative&rdquo; (92.85 per cent), we, by withdrawing blood from<lb/>
the veins of <hi>18 patients</hi>, have to record 100 per cent of failures.</p>
<p>We have already stated that we will reserve for a later report a<lb/>
description of the bacteria isolated from the blood in these cases. We<lb/>
now remark that but few organisms were obtained and that, as a<lb/>
rule, our blood cultures gave no growth whatever.</p>
<p>(B) CULTURES FROM YELLOW-FEVER CADAVERS.</p>
<p>We tried to obtain autopsies very soon after death and sometimes<lb/>
succeed in doing so. Tubes containing about 10 c. c. of flesh-peptone<lb/>
bouillon were generally used for the first inoculation, direct from the<lb/>
blood and organs. As soon as the laboratory was reached, agar plates<lb/>
were made from these inoculated bouillon tubes, the former as well<lb/>
as the latter being then incubated at 35&deg;--37&deg; C. In nearly every<lb/>
case gelatin plates were also made from the recently inoculated<lb/>
bouillon tubes and kept at a temperature of 19&deg;--20&deg; C.</p>
<p>If colonies were found in the agar or gelatin plates on the following<lb/>
days, the corresponding bouillon tubes were also plated on agar and<lb/>
gelatin. The bacteria thus found in our plates were carefully iso-<lb/>
lated and studied upon the usual nutritive media, so as to enable us<lb/>
to identify them if possible. <hi>We will here content ourselves with<lb/>
giving the results as regards the presence of <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> only</hi>.</p>

<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Cultures from the blood during life had been taken by Dr. Lazear in three other cases of yellow fever,<lb/>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
59</p>
<p><hi>Our failure to isolate <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> in these 11 autopsies of yellow</hi>-<lb/>
fever patients <hi>was a result which we had not anticipated</hi>. One of us<lb/>
(Agramonte) who at Santiago, Cuba, during the epidemic of 1898,<lb/>
succeeded in finding <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> in 33 per cent of his autopsies, has<lb/>
been much surprised at the absence of this bacillus in cultures from<lb/>
cadavers sectioned in Habana during the present year. In 2 of the<lb/>
11 cases we had reason to believe that from the character of colonies<lb/>
seen in gelatin plates we would be able to isolate <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>. These<lb/>
colonies, however, when transferred to other media and carefully<lb/>
studied, did not prove to be this bacillus. We wonder whether other<lb/>
observers have occasionally relied upon the appearance of colonies in<lb/>
gelatin plates without further study. We only mention this as a pos-<lb/>
sible explanation of the large percentage of positive results recorded<lb/>
by some observers.</p>
<p><hi>Pothier</hi>, of New Orleans, La., only succeeded, however, in isolating<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> in 3 out of 51 autopsies. (Journal of American Medical<lb/>
Association, Apr. 16, 1898.)</p>
<p>Lutz (Revista D'Igiene e Sanita Publica, XI, No. 13, July, 1900,<lb/>
pp. 474-475), says, as the result of his extensive observations on yellow<lb/>
fever, that <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> can not be found by present laboratory<lb/>
methods in more than half of the cases of yellow fever, and that when<lb/>
present the colonies are few in number.</p>
<p>It is possible that our future autopsies may give more favorable<lb/>
results as regards <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>.</p>
<p>II. THE MOSQUITO AS THE HOST OF THE PARASITE OF YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>Having failed to isolate <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> either from the blood during<lb/>
life or from the blood and organs of cadavers, <hi>two courses of procedure<lb/>
in our further investigations appeared to be deserving of attention</hi>, viz,<lb/>
first, <hi>a careful study of the intestinal flora in yellow fever in compari</hi>-<lb/>
son with the bacteria that we might isolate from the intestinal canal of<lb/>
healthy individuals in this vicinity or of those sick with other dis-<lb/>
eases; <hi>or, secondly, to give our attention to the theory of the propaga</hi>-<lb/>
tion of yellow fever by means of the mosquito--a theory first advanced<lb/>
and ingeniously discussed by Dr. Carlos J. Finlay, of Habana, in 1881.<lb/>
(Anales de la Real Academia, vol. 18, 1881, pp. 147-169.)</p>
<p><hi>We were influenced to take up the second line of investigation</hi> by<lb/>
reason of the well-known facts connected with the epidemiology of<lb/>
this disease, and of course by the brilliant work of Ross and the Italian<lb/>
observers in connection with the theory of the propagation of malaria<lb/>
by the mosquito.</p>
<p>We were also much impressed by the valuable observations made<lb/>
at Orwood and Taylor, Miss., during the year 1898, by Surg. Henry<lb/>
R. Carter, United States Marine-Hospital Service. A note on the<lb/>
interval between infecting and secondary cases of yellow fever, etc.<lb/>
(<hi>Reprint from New Orleans Medical Journal, May, 1900</hi>.) We do not<lb/>
believe that sufficient importance has been accorded these painstaking<lb/>
and valuable data. <hi>We observe that the members of the yellow-fever<lb/>
commission of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Drs. Dur-<lb/>
ham and Myers, to whom we had the pleasure of submitting Carter's<lb/>
observations, have been equally impressed by their importance</hi>.<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>The circumstances under which Carter worked were favorable for<lb/>
recording with considerable accuracy the interval between the time of<lb/>
arrival of infecting cases in isolated farmhouses and the occurrence of<lb/>
secondary cases in these houses. According to Carter, &ldquo;the period<lb/>
from the first (infecting) case to the first group of cases infected at<lb/>
these houses is generally from two to three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The houses having now become infected, susceptible individuals<lb/>
thereafter visiting the houses for a few hours fall sick with the disease<lb/>
in the usual period of incubation--one to seven days.</p>
<p><hi>Other observations made by us since our arrival</hi> confirmed Carter's<lb/>
conclusions, thus pointing, as it seemed to us, to the presence of an<lb/>
intermediate host, such as the mosquito, which, having taken the<lb/>
parasite into its stomach soon after the entrance of the patient into<lb/>
the noninfected house, was able after a certain interval to reconvey<lb/>
the infecting agent to other individuals, thereby converting a non-<lb/>
infected house into an &ldquo;infected&rdquo; house. This interval would appear<lb/>
to be from 9 to 16 days (allowing for the period of incubation), <hi>which<lb/>
agrees fairly closely with the time required for the passage of the<lb/>
malarial parasite from the stomach of the mosquito to its salivary<lb/>
glands</hi>.</p>
<p><hi>In view of the foregoing observations</hi> we concluded to test the<lb/>
theory of Finlay on human beings. <hi>According to this author's obser</hi>-<lb/>
vation of numerous <hi>inoculations in 90 individuals, the application of<lb/>
one or two contaminated mosquitoes is not dangerous, but followed<lb/>
in about 18 per cent by an attack of what he considers to be very<lb/>
benign yellow fever at the most</hi>.</p>
<p>We here desire to express our sincere thanks to Dr. Finlay, who<lb/>
<hi>accorded us a most courteous interview</hi>, and has gladly placed at our<lb/>
disposal his several publications relating to yellow fever during the<lb/>
past 19 years; and also for ova of the species of mosquito with<lb/>
which he had made his several inoculations. An important observa-<lb/>
tion to be here recorded is that, according to Finlay's statement, <hi>30<lb/>
days prior to our visit</hi>, these ova had been deposited by a female just<lb/>
at the edge of the water in a small basin, whose contents had been<lb/>
allowed to slightly evaporate, so that these ova were at the time of our<lb/>
visit entirely above contact with the water. Notwithstanding this<lb/>
long interval after deposition, they were promptly converted into the<lb/>
larval stage, after a short period, by raising the level of the water in<lb/>
the basin.</p>
<p><hi>With the mosquitoes thus obtained we have been able to conduct<lb/>
our experiments</hi>. Specimens of this mosquito forwarded to <hi>Mr. L.<lb/>
O. Howard, entomologist, Department of Agriculture, Washington</hi>,<lb/>
D.C., were kindly identified as <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi> Fabr.</p>
<p>In this preliminary note we have not space to refer at length to<lb/>
the various interesting and valuable contributions made by Finlay to<lb/>
the mosquito theory for the propagation of yellow fever. In addition<lb/>
to the paper already quoted, his most valuable contributions to this<lb/>
important theory are to be found in the articles designated as follows:<lb/>
Estadistica de las Inoculaciones con mosquitos contaminados, etc.,<lb/>
reprint, Havana, 1891; Fiebre Amarilla, Estudio Clinico Patologico y<lb/>
Etiologico, reprint, Habana, 1895; and Yellow Fever Immunity--<lb/>

tional Hygienic and Demography, Budapest, 1894.</p>
<pb n="61" id="S8220069"/>
<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
61</p>
<p>His <hi>present views</hi> on this subject may be stated in his own language:<lb/>
&ldquo;First, reproduction of the disease, in a mild form, within 5 to<lb/>
25 days after having applied contaminated mosquitoes to susceptible<lb/>
subjects. Second, partial or complete immunity against yellow fever<lb/>
obtained when even no pathogenous manifestation had followed<lb/>
those inoculations.&rdquo; (Medical Record, vol 55, No. <hi>21, May 27, 1899</hi>.)</p>
<p>Without reviewing the cases <hi>regarded as mild forms by the</hi> author<lb/>
of this theory, <hi>we believe that he has not as yet succeeded in repro-<lb/>
ducing a well-marked attack of yellow fever within the usual period<lb/>
of incubation of the disease, attended by albumen and jaundice, and<lb/>
in which all other sources of infection could be excluded</hi>.</p>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
63</p>
<p>It will be seen that we record 9 negative and 2 positive results.<lb/>
It is, we think, important to observe that of the 9 failures to infect,<lb/>
the time elapsing between the biting of the mosquito and the inocu-<lb/>
lation of the healthy subject varied in 7 cases from 2 to 8 days (Nos. 1,<lb/>
2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9), and in the remaining two from 10 to 13 days (Nos.<lb/>
6 and 8).</p>
<p>Five individuals out of the 9 who failed to show any result (Nos.<lb/>
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) were inoculated by mosquitoes that had bitten very<lb/>
mild cases of yellow fever on the fifth day of the disease, and one<lb/>
individual by a mosquito that had bitten a mild case of yellow fever<lb/>
on the seventh day of the disease. (This latter patient was discharged<lb/>
from hospital 3 days later.) To this fact may possibly be attributed<lb/>
the negative results. Of the remaining 3 negative cases (Nos. 7, 8,<lb/>
and 9), and which had been inoculated by mosquitoes that had bitten<lb/>
severe cases of the disease, the interval between the bite and the<lb/>
inoculation varied from 2 to 6 days.</p>
<p>In the 2 cases (Nos. 6 and 8) where the interval was respectively<lb/>
10 and 13 days, the inoculations had been made with mosquitoes that<lb/>
had bitten very mild cases of yellow fever on the fifth day of the<lb/>
attack. No. 8 was also bitten by a mosquito which had been infected<lb/>
by a severe case of yellow fever 3 days before.</p>
<p>We refrain from commenting further at this time upon the 9<lb/>
negative cases, preferring to record the results obtained rather than<lb/>
to indulge in speculation.</p>
<p>Of the two cases which we have recorded as positive in Table III,<lb/>
we now propose to speak at greater length.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case 10</hi>.--Dr. James Carroll, acting assistant surgeon, United States Army, a member<lb/>
of this board, was bitten at 2 p. m., <hi>August 27, 1990</hi>, by <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi>. This particu-<lb/>
lar mosquito had bitten a severe case of yellow fever on the second day of the disease 12<lb/>
days before; a mild case of yellow fever, on the first day of the attack, 6 days preceding;<lb/>
a severe case of yellow fever, on the second day of the attack, 4 days before; a mild<lb/>
case of yellow fever, on the second day of attack, 2 days before inoculation.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll remained well until the afternoon of <hi>the 29th, when</hi> he states that he<lb/>
felt tired, and for this reason, when on a <hi>visit to Las Animas Hospital</hi>, the same after-<lb/>
noon (29th), some time between 4 and 6 p. m., after visiting a few patients, he left<lb/>
the wards and waited outside on the porch, while his companions remained in the<lb/>
wards.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">August 30</hi>: During the afternoon, although not feeling well, Dr. Carroll visited La<lb/>
Playa, distant <hi>about 1 1&sol;2 miles from Columbia</hi> Barracks, and took a sea bath.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">August 31, a. m.</hi>: Dr. Carroll realized that he was sick and that he had fever, although<lb/>
he refrained from taking his temperature, but did visit the laboratory, distant about<lb/>
140 yards, for the purpose of examining his blood for the malarial parasite. The<lb/>
examination was negative. <hi>During the afternoon he was compelled to take to his<lb/>
bed</hi>. At 7 p. m. temperature was 102&deg; F. No headache nor backache; only a sense<lb/>
of great lassitude. Eyes injected and face suffused.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">September 1, 7 a. m.</hi>: Temperature 102&deg; F. Blood again carefully examined <hi>by Dr.<lb/>
Lazear</hi> with negative results.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">11 a. m.</hi>: Temperature 102&deg;.</p>
<p>The case having been diagnosed as one of yellow fever, Dr. Carroll was at noon<lb/>
removed to the <hi>yellow fever wards</hi>.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">9 p. m.</hi>: Temperature 102.8&deg;, pulse 90; 12 o'clock midnight, temperature 103.4&deg;,<lb/>
pulse 84.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">September 2, 3 a. m.</hi>: Temperature 103.6&deg;, pulse 80. A trace of albumen was now<lb/>
found in the urine. The subsequent history of the case was one of severe yellow<lb/>
fever. Jaundice appeared on September 3.</p>
<p>The accompanying chart No. 1 contains all of the necessary data.</p>
<p>The question of diagnosis having been clearly and easily estab-<lb/>
lished, it now becomes important to follow Dr. Carroll's movements<lb/>
for a period of 10 days preceding the mosquito inoculation, and<lb/>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
65</p>
<p>during the period elapsing from the bite of the insect until the com-<lb/>
mencement of the attack.</p>
<p>On August 21, 22, and 23, Dr. Carroll was at Columbia Barracks,<lb/>
outside of the epidemic zone. On August 24 he visited the autopsy<lb/>
room of Military Hospital No. 1, which is situated on Principe Hill<lb/>
overlooking the city of Habana. He was present in this autopsy<lb/>
room while an autopsy was made by Dr. Agramonte <hi>on a case of per-<lb/>
nicious malarial fever</hi>. Dr. Carroll only took cultures from the<lb/>
blood and organs as the section proceeded. He was there about half<lb/>
an hour and then returned to Columbia Barracks. Subsequent<lb/>
microscopic study of sections of the liver and spleen showed that the<lb/>
case autopsied on the 29th was really a case of <hi>pernicious malarial</hi><lb/>
fever.</p>
<p>It should be stated that although cases of yellow fever are not<lb/>
admitted to Military Hospital No. 1, an English sea captain had been<lb/>
admitted to its wards a few days before, whose case developed into<lb/>
one of <hi>yellow fever with fatal result</hi>, and the body had been autopsied<lb/>
by Dr. Agramonte in this dead room <hi>on the day preceding</hi> Dr. Car-<lb/>
roll's visit to it.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Carroll, the room was by no means in a cleanly<lb/>
condition. As Dr. Carroll's visit to this room was made on August 24,<lb/>
and as he began to complain on August 29, about the average period<lb/>
of incubation of yellow fever, <hi>there is a possible chance for infection<lb/>
in this way</hi>. We must call attention, however, to the fact that Dr.<lb/>
Agramonte, whenever he performs an autopsy in this room, is always<lb/>
attended by a young soldier of the Hospital Corps, United States<lb/>
Army, who is detailed for that purpose, and whose duty it is to assist<lb/>
and to afterwards attend to the cleaning of the autopsy table. <hi>This<lb/>
soldier, a nonimmune American</hi>, was present when Dr. Carroll was<lb/>
there and remained afterwards to attend to his duties. He <hi>has not<lb/>
contracted yellow-fever by his duties in this room from time to time</hi>.<lb/>
Our own experience would seem to accord with that of others, viz,<lb/>
that attendance upon autopsies and the handling of portions of<lb/>
organs of yellow-fever cases removed to the laboratory is unattended<lb/>
with danger. <hi>Certainly the three nonimmune members of this board,<lb/>
up to the time of these mosquito inoculations, had during the past<lb/>
three months come in close contact with the dead</hi> bodies and organs<lb/>
of yellow-fever cases, <hi>freely handling and examining these organs</hi>,<lb/>
including the small intestine, even kept at thermostat temperature<lb/>
for 24 hours, without contracting the disease. We have, of course,<lb/>
<hi>never neglected to cleanse our hands with disinfectants</hi>.</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll upon his visit to the before-mentioned dead room only<lb/>
used the platinum loop for taking cultures and did not come in contact<lb/>
with the autopsy table.</p>
<p>The only other opportunity for infection in his case would appear<lb/>
to have been during his <hi>visit to Las Animas Hospital</hi>, situated in the<lb/>
suburbs of Habana, as here yellow-fever patients are admitted in<lb/>
large numbers. We have already pointed out that Dr. Carroll was<lb/>
complaining of lassitude at the hour of his visit, which was about 50<lb/>
hours after his inoculation with the contaminated mosquito. We<lb/>
have also called attention to the fact that <hi>he remained for the greater<lb/>
part of his visit outside of the hospital, on the piazza</hi>. This would<lb/>

<pb n="66" id="S8220074"/>
66<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
appear to cast doubt upon his visit to Las Animas as the source of<lb/>
his infection.</p>
<p>We do not wish to be understood as unnecessarily seeking to lay<lb/>
too much emphasis upon the exclusion in this case of other sources<lb/>
of infection than the mosquito, <hi>as we fully appreciate that Dr. Carroll<lb/>
had been on two occasions within the epidemic zone during the week<lb/>
preceding his attack of yellow fever</hi>. His movements on these occa-<lb/>
sions we have already given.</p>
<p>We will again refer to Dr. Carroll's case after we have given the<lb/>
history of case No. 11, which we have designated as our second posi-<lb/>
tive result.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case 11</hi>.--X. Y., white, American, a resident of the military reservation of Colum-<lb/>
bia Barracks, was bitten during the <hi><del>forenoon</del><add>afternoon</add> of the 31st day of August</hi>, 1900, by the<lb/>
same mosquito that had bitten case 10 (Dr. Carroll) 4 days before, and which in the<lb/>
meanwhile had bitten a mild case of yellow fever (first day) 2 days before being applied<lb/>
to X. Y.</p>
<p>X. Y. was also bitten by a <hi>second mosquito</hi> that had been applied to a fatal case<lb/>
of yellow fever (second day) 12 days before, and to 2 mild cases (second day) 4 and 10<lb/>
days previously; also, by a <hi>third mosquito</hi> that had bitten a fatal case of yellow fever<lb/>
(second day) 12 days before, a severe case (first day) 2 days before, and 3 mild cases<lb/>
(first, second, and third day) 4, 6, and 10 days before; finally, <hi>by a fourth mosquito</hi><lb/>
that had bitten 3 severe cases of yellow fever (all on the first day) 2, 4, and 8 days<lb/>
previously, and 1 mild case (second day) 6 days before. (Vide Table III.)</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that <hi>X. Y. was bitten by 4 mosquitoes</hi>, 2 of which had bitten<lb/>
severe (fatal) cases of yellow fever 12 days previously, one of which had bitten a severe<lb/>
case (second day) 16 days before, and one which had bitten a severe case (first day)<lb/>
8 days before.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">September <del>2</del>5</hi>.--X. Y. began to experience a sense of dizziness and disinclination to<lb/>
work. This was just 5 days from the time of the mosquito inoculation.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours later, still dizzy and light-headed in attempting to move about<lb/>
During the afternoon (sixth day after inoculation) chilly sensations, followed by fever<lb/>
and restlessness during the night.</p>
<p>On the following day (seventh day after inoculation), 8 a. m., temperature 102.8&deg; F.,<lb/>
eyes slightly injected, face suffused. Patient removed to the <hi>yellow fever wards</hi>;<lb/>
9 a. m., temperature 103&deg; F., pulse 66. A trace of albumen was found in the urine<lb/>
during the afternoon (third day of the attack). This increased during the following<lb/>
days. Conjunctiv&aelig; slightly jaundiced on the fourth day of disease, which was more<lb/>
distinct and could be plainly seen on anterior aspect of chest on the fifth and following<lb/>
day. Bleeding from the gums was noticed on the third and subsequent days after<lb/>
admission. Repeated examinations of the blood failed to show any malarial parasites.</p>
<p>The course of the fever, the appearance of albumen in the urine,<lb/>
with jaundice and hemorrhage from the gums, together with the slow<lb/>
pulse, all pointed distinctly to the diagnosis of yellow fever. His<lb/>
attending physician, Dr. Roger P. Ames, United States Army, an<lb/>
expert in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease, did not hesitate<lb/>
to diagnose X. Y.'s attack as one of &ldquo;well-pronounced yellow fever.&rdquo;<lb/>
<hi>Dr. Ames was not cognizant of the method of inoculation</hi> in this case.<lb/>
(Vide, Chart II.)</p>
<p>The diagnosis, therefore, not being in doubt, we must follow this<lb/>
patient's movements during the 10 days preceding the bite of the<lb/>
mosquitoes and from this time until 5 days later, when the attack<lb/>
began. It so happens that we can follow X. Y.'s movements for a<lb/>
much longer period. Fifty-seven days prior to his inoculation, he<lb/>
spent a day and night in the city of Habana. Sixteen days before the<lb/>
inoculation, he rode on horseback with 6 other nonimmunes a dis-<lb/>
tance of <hi>about 1 1&sol;2 miles toward the seashore</hi> and returned to his<lb/>
dwelling, without in the meantime dismounting from his horse.<lb/>
From this time until his complete convalescence was established, he<lb/>
<pb n="67" id="S8220075"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
67<lb/>
had remained within the immediate vicinity of <hi>his home.</hi> So that it<lb/>
may be positively stated that X. Y. had not absented himself from the<lb/>
military reservation of Columbia Barracks during a period of 57<lb/>
days prior to his inoculation (with the exception above stated),<lb/>
nor between the date of his inoculation and the establishment of con-<lb/>
valescence.</p>
<p>Let us now inquire whether the <hi>military reservation of Columbia<lb/>
Barracks</hi> is outside of the epidemic zone of yellow fever. To this</p>

<p>we answer that since the commencement of the <hi>present epidemic of<lb/>
yellow fever in Habana, dating from May, 1990</hi>, the average monthly<lb/>
population of this station, including civilian employees, has been<lb/>
<hi>1,400, nearly all of whom are young nonimmunes</hi>.</p>
<p>There have occurred amongst this nonimmune population from<lb/>
May 1 to October 13, 1900, <hi>16 cases of yellow fever</hi>, all of which<lb/>
have been easily and readily traced to a visit to within the boundaries<lb/>
of the epidemic zone, except cases 10 and 11 of Table III, and 1<lb/>

<p><hi>Ten of these cases</hi>, have occurred amongst an average monthly<lb/>
military <hi>population of 1,295</hi> men, and <hi>6 cases in an average civilian<lb/>
population of 105.</hi></p>
<p>Whenever these cases have occurred, as soon as the patient has<lb/>
been removed to hospital most careful measures of disinfection have<lb/>
been immediately carried out by a trained sanitary squad, under the<lb/>
personal supervision of a medical officer. <hi>These have consisted of<lb/>
destruction by fire of mattresses, the disinfection of bedding</hi> and<lb/>
<hi>clothing with 1 to 500 bichloride solution, and</hi> the application of the<lb/>
same solution freely to the ceiling, walls, and floors by means of a<lb/>
force pump.</p>
<p>We repeat that no case has ever been connected with a preceding<lb/>
case, but that the source of infection has been readily shown to have<lb/>
occurred during the individual's visit to Habana, 6 miles distant, or<lb/>
to some other nearer Cuban settlement.</p>
<p>We now invite attention to the fact that from August 17 to October<lb/>
13, a period of 57 days, only 3 cases of yellow fever have occurred<lb/>
amongst this population of 1,400 nonimmune Americans, and we<lb/>
consider it very important to note that two of these had been bitten,<lb/>
within 5 days of the commencement of their attack, by contaminated<lb/>
mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Taken in connection with case 2, in which we have been unable to<lb/>
find any other source of infection than the bite of an infected mos-<lb/>
quito, 5 days preceding the attack, the case of Dr. Carroll (case<lb/>
10, Table III) becomes strongly confirmatory of the same origin.</p>
<p>We will now briefly give the history of the third case of yellow fever<lb/>
that has occurred at Columbia Barracks during the period August 17<lb/>
to October 13, 1900.</p>
<p>In the light of cases 10 and 11 we consider this case of sufficient<lb/>
importance to be here included, <hi>especially as it is one that might be<lb/>
possibly designated as a case of accidental infection by a mosquito</hi>.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case</hi>.--Dr. Jesse W. Lazear, acting assistant surgeon, United States Army, a member<lb/>
of this board, was bitten <hi>on August 16, 1900 (case 6, Table III), by a</hi> mosquito (<hi rend="italic">Culex<lb/>
fasciatus</hi>) which 10 days previously had been contaminated by biting a very mild<lb/>
case of yellow fever (fifth day). No appreciable disturbance of health followed this<lb/>
inoculation.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">September 13, 1900 (forenoon)</hi>: Dr. Lazear, while on a visit to Las Animas Hospital,<lb/>
and while collecting blood from yellow-fever patients for study, was bitten by a Culex<lb/>
<pb n="69" id="S8220077"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
69<lb/>
mosquito (species undertermined). As Dr. Lazear had been previously bitten by a<lb/>
contaminated insect without after effects, he deliberately allowed this particular<lb/>
mosquito, which had settled on the back of his hand, to remain until it had satisfied<lb/>
its hunger.</p>
<p>On the evening of September 18, 5 days after the bite, Dr. Lazear complained of<lb/>
feeling &ldquo;out of sorts,&rdquo; and had a chill at 8 p. m.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">September 19:</hi> Twelve o'clock noon, temperature 102.4&deg;, pulse, 112. Eyes injected,<lb/>
face suffused; 3 p. m., temperature, 103.4&deg;, pulse, 104; 6 p. m., temperature, 103.8&deg;,<lb/>
pulse, 106. Albumen appeared in the urine. Jaundice appeared on the third day.<lb/>
The subsequent history of this case was one of progressive and fatal yellow fever, the<lb/>
death of our much lamented colleague having occurred on the evening of Septem-<lb/>
ber 25, 1900.</p>
<p><hi>As Dr. Lazear was bitten by a mosquito while present in the wards</hi><lb/>
of a yellow-fever hospital, one must, at least, admit the possibility of<lb/>
this insect's contamination by a previous bite of a yellow-fever<lb/>
patient. This case of <hi>accidental infection</hi> therefore can not fail to<lb/>
be of interest, taken in connection with cases 10 and 11.</p>
<p>For ourselves, we have been <hi>profoundly impressed</hi> with the mode of<lb/>
infection and with the results that followed the bite of the mosquito<lb/>
in these three cases. Our results would appear to throw new light<lb/>
on Carter's observations in Mississippi, as to the period required<lb/>
between the introduction of the first (infecting) case and the occur-<lb/>
rence of secondary cases of yellow fever.</p>
<p>Since we here, for the first time, record <hi>a case</hi> in which a typical<lb/>
attack of yellow fever has followed the bite of an infected mosquito,<lb/>
within the usual period of incubation of the disease, and in which<lb/>
other sources of infection can be excluded, we feel confident that the<lb/>
publication of these observations <hi>must excite renewed interest</hi> in the<lb/>
mosquito <hi>theory</hi> of the propagation of yellow fever, as first <hi>proposed</hi><lb/>
by Finlay.</p>
<p>From our study thus far of yellow fever, we draw the following<lb/>
conclusions:</p>
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> (Sanarelli) stands in no causative relation to<lb/>
yellow fever, but when present should be considered as a secondary<lb/>
invader in this disease.</p>
<p>2. The mosquito serves as the intermediate host for the parasite of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>

TIDES AGRAMONTE, M. D., Acting Assistant Surgeons, United States Army.</byline>
<p>At the twenty-eighth annual meeting of the American Public Health<lb/>
Association,<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> held in Indianapolis, Ind., October 22-26, 1900, we pre-<lb/>
sented, in the form of a preliminary note, the results of our bac-<lb/>
teriologic study of yellow fever, based on cultures taken from the blood<lb/>
<hi>in 18 cases at various stages</hi> of the disease, as well as on those which<lb/>
we have made from the blood and organs of 11 yellow-fever cadavers.<lb/>
We also recorded the results obtained from the inoculation of <hi>11 non-<lb/>
immune individuals by means of</hi> the bite of mosquitoes (<hi rend="italic">Culex fascia-<lb/>
tus</hi>, Fabr.) that had previously fed on the blood of patients sick with<lb/>
yellow fever. We were able to report two positive results, in which<lb/>
the attack of yellow fever followed the bite of a mosquito within the<lb/>
usual period of incubation of this disease.</p>
<p>In one of these cases all other sources of infection could be posi-<lb/>
tively excluded. From our several observations we drew the follow-<lb/>
ing conclusions: (1) <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> (Sanarelli) stands in no causa-<lb/>
tive relation to yellow fever, but when present should be considered<lb/>
as a secondary invader in this disease. (2) The mosquito serves as<lb/>
the intermediate host for the parasite of yellow fever. Since the pub-<lb/>
lication of our preliminary note we have continued our investigations,<lb/>
especially as regards the means by which yellow fever is propagated<lb/>
from individual to individual, and as to the manner in which houses<lb/>
become infected with the contagium of this disease. The results<lb/>
already obtained are so positive and striking that, with the permis-<lb/>
sion of Surg. Gen. Sternberg, we have concluded to present to this<lb/>
congress an additional note, in which we will record these later<lb/>
observations. We desire to here express <hi>our sincere thanks</hi> to the<lb/>
military governor of the island of Cuba, <hi>Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood</hi>,<lb/>
United States Volunteers, <hi>without whose approval and assistance<lb/>
these observations could not have been carried out</hi>.</p>
<p>In order to exercise perfect control over the movements of those<lb/>
individuals who were to be subjected to experimentation, and to<lb/>
avoid any other possible source of infection, <hi>a location was selected<lb/>
in an open and uncultivated field, about 1 mile from the town of<lb/>
Quemados, Cuba</hi>. Here an experimental sanitary station was estab-<lb/>
lished <hi>under the complete control of the senior member of this board</hi>.<lb/>
This station was named Camp Lazear, in honor of our late colleague,<lb/>
Dr. Jesse W. Lazear, acting assistant surgeon, United States Army,<lb/>
who died of yellow fever, while courageously investigating the<lb/>
causation of this disease. The site selected was very well drained,<lb/>
freely exposed to sunlight and winds, and, from every point of view,<lb/>
satisfactory for the purposes intended.</p>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>

<p>The personnel of this camp consisted of two medical officers, Dr.<lb/>
Roger P. Ames, acting assistant surgeon, United States Army, an<lb/>
immune; in immediate charge; Dr. R. P. Cooke, acting assistant<lb/>
surgeon, United States Army, nonimmune; one acting hospital<lb/>
steward, an immune; nine privates of the hospital corps, one of whom<lb/>
was immune; and one immune ambulance driver.</p>
<p>For the quartering of this detachment, and of such nonimmune<lb/>
individuals as should be received for experimentation, hospital tents,<lb/>
properly floored, were provided. <hi>These were placed at a distance of<lb/>
about 20 feet from each other, and were numbered 1 to 7, respectively</hi>.</p>
<p>Camp Lazear was established November 20, 1900, and from this<lb/>
date was strictly quarantined, no one being permitted to leave or<lb/>
enter camp except the three immune members of the detachment<lb/>
and the members of the board. Supplies were drawn chiefly from<lb/>
Columbia Barracks, and for this purpose a conveyance under the con-<lb/>
trol of an immune acting hospital steward, and having an immune<lb/>
driver, was used.</p>
<p><hi>A few Spanish immigrants, recently arrived at the port of Habana,<lb/>
were received at Camp Lazear, from time to time, while these observa-<lb/>
tions were being carried out</hi>. A nonimmune person, having once left<lb/>
this camp, was not permitted to return to it under any circumstances<lb/>
whatever.</p>
<p>The temperature and pulse of all nonimmune residents were care-<lb/>
fully recorded three times a day. Under these circumstances any<lb/>
infected individual entering the camp could be promptly detected and<lb/>
removed. As a matter of fact <hi>only two persons, not the subject of<lb/>
experimentation, developed any rise of temperature; one, a Spanish<lb/>
immigrant, with probably commencing pulmonary tuberculosis</hi>, who<lb/>
was discharged at the end of three days; and the other, <hi>a Spanish<lb/>
immigrant, who developed a temperature</hi> of 102.6&deg; F. on the after-<lb/>
noon of his fourth day in camp. <hi>He was at once removed with his<lb/>
entire bedding and baggage and placed in the receiving ward at Colum-<lb/>
bia Barracks</hi>. His fever, which was marked by daily intermissions<lb/>
for three days, subsided on the administration of cathartics and ene-<lb/>
mata. His first attack was considered to be due to <hi>intestinal irrita-<lb/>
tion</hi>. He was not permitted, however, to return to the camp.</p>
<p>No nonimmune resident was subjected to inoculation who had not<lb/>
passed in this camp the full period of incubation of yellow fever, <hi>with<lb/>
one exception, to be</hi> hereinafter mentioned.</p>
<p>OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>Having thus sufficiently indicated the environment of Camp<lb/>
Lazear and the conditions under which its residents lived, we will<lb/>
now proceed to a narration of the observations thus far made at this<lb/>
experimental station. <hi>At the time these inoculations were begun</hi>,<lb/>
the several tents were occupied as follows: Tent No. 1 by one im-<lb/>
mune and one nonimmune; No. 2 by one immune and two non-<lb/>
immunes; No. 3 by two immunes; No. 4 by three nonimmunes;<lb/>
No. 5 by three nonimmunes; No. 6 by two nonimmunes; and No. 7<lb/>
by one nonimmune.</p>
<p>For the purpose of experimentation, subjects were selected as<lb/>
follows: From tent No. 2, <hi>two nonimmunes</hi>, and from tent No. 5,<lb/>
three nonimmunes. Later, one nonimmune in tent No. 6 was also<lb/>
designated for inoculation.</p>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case 1</hi>.--Pvt. John R. Kissinger, Hospital Corps, United States Army, aged 23, a<lb/>
nonimmune, occupant of tent No. 2, with his full consent, was <hi>bitten at 10.30 a. m.,<lb/>
November 20, 1900</hi>, by a mosquito (<hi rend="italic">C. fasciatus</hi>) that had bitten a severe case of<lb/>
yellow fever on the fifth day, 11 days previously; another severe case, on the third<lb/>
day, 6 days before; and a third severe one on the third day, 3 days before. As Kissinger<lb/>
had not absented himself from Columbia Barracks for a period of more than 30 days, it<lb/>
was considered safe to inoculate him without waiting for his period of incubation to<lb/>
pass.</p>
<p><hi>November 23, 1900</hi>, Kissinger was again bitten by the same mosquito. The result<lb/>
of both inoculations was negative. The mosquito, therefore, was incapable of convey-<lb/>
ing any infection on the eleventh or fourteenth day after it had bitten a severe case<lb/>
of yellow fever on the third day of the disease. This insect had been kept at ordinary<lb/>
room temperature and died November 26, 1900.</p>
<p><hi>December 5, 1900</hi>, at 2 p. m., 12 days after the last inoculation, Kissinger was again<lb/>
bitten by 5 mosquitoes (<hi rend="italic">C. fasciatus</hi>), 2 of which had bitten fatal cases of yellow fever,<lb/>
1 the second day, 15 days before; 1 a severe case on the second day, 19 days previously,<lb/>
and 2 a mild case on the third day, 21 days before.</p>
<p>The record of temperature and pulse, taken every 3 hours following this inoculation,<lb/>
showed that the subject remained in his usual state of health during the following 3<lb/>
days, except that on December 8, on the third day, Kissinger had slight vertigo upon<lb/>
rising, which soon passed away. At 4.30 p. m.--commencement of fourth day--he<lb/>
complained of frontal headache; otherwise he felt well and partook of supper with<lb/>
appetite; at 9 p. m., temperature was 98.4&deg; F., pulse 90; at 11.30 p. m., he awoke<lb/>
with a chill, his temperature 100&deg; F., pulse 90; he complained of severe frontal head-<lb/>
ache and backache; his eyes were injected and his face suffused. December 9 at 3<lb/>
a. m., his temperature was 102&deg; F., pulse 102; he had violent headache and backache,<lb/>
with nausea and vomiting. <hi>He was then removed to the yellow-fever wards</hi>. His<lb/>
subsequent history was that of a case of yellow fever at moderate severity. Albumin<lb/>
appeared in the urine on the fourth day, increased to <hi>one-fifth by volume on the sixth</hi><lb/>
day, and disappeared on December 22. Granular casts were present in considerable<lb/>
numbers from the fourth to the eighth day. The conjunctiv&aelig; were jaundiced on the<lb/>
third day. The <hi>diagnosis of yellow fever in this case was made by Drs. Juan Guit&eacute;ras,<lb/>
Carlos Finlay, W. C. Gorgas, and A. Diaz Albertini, the board of yellow-fever experts<lb/>
of the city of Habana</hi>, who saw the patient on several occasions during his illness. (See<lb/>
Chart I.) The period of incubation in this case was 3 days, 9 1&sol;2 hours.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case 2</hi>.--John J. Moran, aged 24, an American, nonimmune, occupant of tent No. 2,<lb/>
with his full consent, was bitten at 10 a. m., <hi>November 26, 1900</hi>, by a mosquito (<hi rend="italic">C.<lb/>
fasciatus</hi>) which 12 days before had bitten a case of yellow fever of moderate severity,<lb/>
on the third day of the disease. This insect had also bitten a well-marked case of<lb/>
yellow fever--second day--10 days previously.</p>
<p><hi>November 29</hi>, at 2.20 p. m., Moran was again bitten by the same mosquito. The<lb/>
result of both of these inoculations was negative. This insect was therefore incapable<lb/>
of conveying the infection 15 days after having bitten a case of yellow fever of mod-<lb/>
erate severity on the third day, and 13 days after it had bitten a well-marked case of<lb/>
this disease on the second day. This mosquito had been kept at room temperature.<lb/>
Moran's case will be again referred to when we come to speak of the infection of a<lb/>
building by means of contaminated mosquitoes.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case 3</hi>.--A Spanish immigrant, aged 26, a nonimmune occupant of tent No. 5, with<lb/>
his full consent, was bitten at 4 p. m., <hi>December 8, 1900</hi>, by 4 mosquitoes (<hi rend="italic">C. fasciatus</hi>)<lb/>
which had been contaminated as follows: One by biting a fatal case of yellow fever,<lb/>
on the third day, 17 days before; 1 a severe case, on the third day, 18 days before; 1<lb/>
a severe case, on the second day, 22 days before, and 1 a case of moderate severity,<lb/>
on the third day, 24 days previously.</p>
<p>The record of temperature and pulse, taken every 3 hours after the inoculation, shows<lb/>
no rise of temperature above 99&deg; F. until 6 p. m., December 13, on the sixth day,<lb/>
when 99.4&deg; F. is recorded; pulse, 68. The subject, who was of a very lively disposi-<lb/>
tion, retained his usual spirits until noon of the 13th, although he complained of slight<lb/>
frontal headache on the 11th and 12th. He took to his bed at noon of the 13th, the<lb/>
fifth day, complaining of increased frontal headache and a sense of fatigue. At 9<lb/>
p. m., his temperature was 98.2&deg; F., pulse 62.</p>
<p>December 14, at 6 a. m., temperature was 98&deg; F., pulse 72, and he still complained<lb/>
of frontal headache and general malaise. Profuse epistaxis occurred at 7.45 a. m.; at<lb/>
9 a. m., temperature was 99.6&deg; F., pulse 80; at 1.15 p. m., temperature was 100&deg; F.,<lb/>
pulse 80, and he complained of a sense of chillness, with frontal headache increased,<lb/>
and slight pain in the back, arms, and legs; at 3 p. m., temperature was 100&deg; F., pulse<lb/>
80; at 4.15 p. m., temperature 100.7&deg; F., pulse 68; his face flushed and eyes congested.<lb/>
<hi>He was removed to the yellow-fever wards</hi>. A trace of albumin was found in the urine<lb/>
<pb n="75" id="S8220083"/>

passed at 3.30 p. m., December 15; a few hyaline cases were present. He was seen<lb/>
at this time by the Habana board of experts, and the diagnosis of mild yellow fever<lb/>
confirmed. (See Chart No. 2.)</p>
<p>The period of incubation in this case was 4 days and 24 hours, counting from the<lb/>
time of inoculation to the hour when the patient took to his bed; if reckoned to the<lb/>
onset of fever, it was 5 days and 17 hours.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case 4</hi>.--A Spanish immigrant, aged 27, a nonimmune occupant of tent No. 5,<lb/>
with his full consent, was bitten at 10 a. m. November 26, 1900, by a mosquito (<hi rend="italic">C.<lb/>
fasciatus</hi>) which had bitten a severe case of yellow fever on the second day 10 days<lb/>
before. Three days later, November 29, he was again bitten by the same insect.<lb/>
December 2, after an interval of 3 days, he was again bitten by the same insect,<lb/>
and also by a second mosquito (<hi rend="italic">C. fasciatus</hi>) which 12 days before had been con-<lb/>
taminated by biting a fatal case of yellow fever on the third day. No unfavorable<lb/>
effects followed any of these attempted inoculations. The first-mentioned mosquito,<lb/>
therefore, was incapable of conveying any infection on the seventeenth day after<lb/>
biting a severe case of yellow fever on the second day; the other also failed to infect<lb/>
on the twelfth day after biting a fatal case of yellow fever on the third day. Both<lb/>
of these mosquitoes had been kept at ordinary room temperature.</p>
<p>December 9, after an interval of 7 days, the subject was again bitten, at 10.30 a. m.,<lb/>
by 1 mosquito (<hi rend="italic">C. fasciatus</hi>) which had been infected 19 days before by biting a<lb/>
fatal case of yellow fever on the second day of the disease. He remained in his usual<lb/>
health until 9 a. m. <hi>December 12, the</hi> third day, when he complained of frontal<lb/>
headache; his temperature was 98.8&deg; F., pulse 96. This headache continued during<lb/>
the entire day. At 6 p. m. temperature was 99&deg; F., pulse 94; at 9 p. m. tempera-<lb/>
ture 99&deg; F., pulse 84; at 9.30 p. m. temperature 99.4&deg; F., pulse 82. Severe head-<lb/>
ache and backache was complained of; his eyes were injected and his face suffused.<lb/>
<hi>The following morning he was sent to the yellow-fever wards</hi>. Urine passed at 4.20<lb/>
p. m. December 15, the third day, gave a distinct trace of albumin. Many hyaline<lb/>
casts were present on the same date. The conjunctiv&aelig; were jaundiced on the third<lb/>
day.</p>
<p>The patient was seen by the board of experts on December 14 and the diagnosis<lb/>
of yellow fever made. (See Chart No. 3.)</p>
<p>The period of incubation in this case was 3 days 11 1&sol;2 hours.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case 5</hi>.--A Spanish immigrant, aged 26, a nonimmune occupant of tent No. 5,<lb/>
with his full consent, was bitten at 10 a. m. November 26, 1900, by a mosquito (<hi rend="italic">C.<lb/>
fasciatus</hi>) that had bitten a well-marked case of yellow fever on the third day 12<lb/>
days before. November 29 he was again bitten by the same insect. December 2<lb/>
he was for the third time bitten by 2 mosquitoes (<hi rend="italic">C. fasciatus</hi>), both of which had<lb/>
bitten a well-marked case of yellow fever on the third day, 18 days before. As no<lb/>
bad results followed any of these inoculations, it follows that these mosquitoes were<lb/>
incapable of conveying any infection 18 days after they had bitten a well-marked<lb/>
case of yellow fever on the third day. Both of these insects had been kept at room<lb/>
temperature.</p>
<p>December 11, after an interval of 9 days, the subject was again, at 4.30 p. m., bitten<lb/>
by the same mosquitoes, 4 in number, that had been applied to case 3 three days prior<lb/>
to this time, with positive results.</p>
<p>The record of temperature and pulse, taken every 3 hours following the inoculation,<lb/>
showed no change till December 13, the second day, at 9 a. m., when the temperature<lb/>
was 99&deg; F., and the pulse 78. From this hour till 6 p. m. the temperature varied from<lb/>
99.2&deg; to 99.6&deg; F. The subject complained of frontal headache, slight in degree,<lb/>
during the entire day. At 9 p. m. his temperature was 98.4&deg; F., pulse 62.</p>
<p>December 14, the third day, he complained of slight frontal headache during the<lb/>
entire day, and was indisposed to exertion. From 6 a. m. to 6 p. m. the temperature<lb/>

He still had frontal headache. At 9 a. m. temperature was 99.2&deg; F., pulse 80; at 12,<lb/>

of headache and pains throughout the body. At 2 p. m. the temperature was 100&deg; F.,<lb/>
the pulse 80; eyes much congested; face flushed. At 6 p. m. his temperature had risen<lb/>
to 102&deg; F., and the pulse to 90. He was then transferred to the yellow fever wards.<lb/>
Albumin appeared in the urine at 7.30 a. m., December 17. Bleeding from the gums<lb/>

29. (See Chart 4.)</p>
<p>The period of incubation in this case, if reckoned from the time of inoculation to<lb/>
the hour when the patient took to his bed, was 3 days, 19 1&sol;2 hours.</p>
<p>The four patients whose histories we have given above were also<lb/>
examined by a number of physicians of Habana, among whom we may<lb/>
mention <hi>Dr. Bango, of &ldquo;La Covadonga,&rdquo; Dr. Sanchez, of &ldquo;La Ben&eacute;-<lb/>
fica,&rdquo; and Dr. Moas, of &ldquo;La Purissima Concepcion,&rdquo;</hi> by all of whom<lb/>
the diagnosis of yellow fever was confirmed. Let us now rapidly<lb/>
review the circumstances attending these cases of experimental yellow<lb/>
fever, in order to emphasize certain points of interest and importance<lb/>
in connection with their occurrence. (We omit any reference to the<lb/>
clinical histories.)</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that at the time when these inoculations<lb/>
were begun there were only <hi>12 nonimmune residents</hi> at Camp Lazear,<lb/>
and that 5 of these were selected for experiment, viz, 2 in tent No. 2<lb/>
and 3 in tent No. 5. Of these we succeeded in infecting 4, viz, 1 in<lb/>
tent No. 2 and 3 in tent No. 5, each of whom developed an attack of<lb/>
yellow fever within the period of incubation of this disease. The one<lb/>
negative result, therefore, was in case 2--Moran--inoculated with a<lb/>
mosquito on the fifteenth day after the insect had bitten a case of<lb/>
yellow fever on the third day. Since this mosquito failed to infect<lb/>
case 4, three days after it had bitten Moran, it follows that the result<lb/>
could not have been otherwise than negative in the latter case. We<lb/>
now know, as the result of our observations, that in the case of an<lb/>
insect kept at room temperature <hi>during the cool weather of November,<lb/>
15 or even 18 days would, in all probability, be too short a time to<lb/>
render it capable of producing the disease</hi>.</p>
<p>As bearing on the source of infection, we invite attention to the<lb/>
period of time during which the subjects had been kept under rigid<lb/>
<hi>quarantine</hi>, prior to successful inoculation, which was as follows:<lb/>
<hi>Case 1, 15 days; case 3, 9 days; case 4, 19 days; case 5, 21 days</hi>.<lb/>
We further desire to emphasize the fact that this epidemic of yellow<lb/>
fever, which affected 33.33 per cent. of the nonimmune residents of<lb/>
Camp Lazear, did not concern the <hi>7 nonimmunes occupying tents<lb/>
No. 1, 4, 6, and 7, but was</hi> strictly limited to those individuals who<lb/>
had been bitten by contaminated mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Nothing could point more forcibly to the source of this infection<lb/>
than the order of the occurrence of events at this camp. The pre-<lb/>
cision with which the infection of the individual followed the bite of<lb/>
the mosquito left nothing to be desired in order to fulfill the require-<lb/>
ments of a scientific experiment.</p>
<p><hi>The epidemic having ceased on December 15, 1900</hi>, no other case<lb/>
of yellow fever occurred in this camp until we again began to expose<lb/>
individuals to inoculation. Thus 15 days later we made the following<lb/>
observation:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case 6</hi>.--A Spanish immigrant, aged 27, a nonimmune occupant of tent No. 6, with<lb/>
his full consent, was bitten at 11 a. m., December 30, 1900, by 4 mosquitoes (<hi rend="italic">C. fascia-<lb/>
tus</hi>) that had been contaminated 17 days previously by biting a mild case of yellow<lb/>
fever on the first day of the disease (case 4). These insects had been kept at a tem-<lb/>
perature of 82&deg; F.</p>
<p>The subject remained in his normal condition until the evening of January 2, 1901,<lb/>
the third day, when he complained of frontal headache. At 6 p. m., his temperature<lb/>
was 99&deg; F., pulse 64. He slept well, but still complained of headache on the following<lb/>
morning, January 3. He partook sparingly of breakfast, and afterwards lay on his bed,<lb/>
<pb n="81" id="S8220089"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
81<lb/>
being disinclined to exert himself. At 9 a. m., the temperature was 99&deg; F., the pulse<lb/>
96; at 10.30 a. m., temperature 100&deg; F., pulse 80. A sense of chilliness and sharp<lb/>
frontal headache was complained of, and at 3 p. m. his temperature was 100.8&deg;F., his<lb/>
pulse 89, and his eyes were congested and face flushed. <hi>He was removed to the<lb/>
yellow-fever wards</hi>. A specimen of urine passed at midnight, January 4, contained a<lb/>
distinct trace of albumin. Slight bleeding from the gums occurred on the fifth and<lb/>
sixth days. The patient was seen by the board of experts on the second and seventh<lb/>
days of his attack, and the diagnosis of yellow fever confirmed. (See Chart 5.)</p>
<p>The period of incubation in this case was 3 days. 22 1&sol;2 hours. The subject had<lb/>
remained in strict quarantine for 22 days preceding his inoculation.</p>
<p>In considering the character of the attacks and the course of the<lb/>
disease in these five cases of experimental yellow fever, it must be<lb/>
borne in mind that these infected individuals were all young men, in<lb/>
good general physical condition and placed amid excellent hygienic<lb/>
surroundings. Further, it must not be forgotten that, on the earliest<lb/>
manifestation of an approaching infection, they were <hi>each and all put<lb/>
to bed at once, and were even carried to the yellow-fever wards while<lb/>
occupying the same bed</hi>. In other words, these men were kept at<lb/>
absolute rest from the first inception of the disease. Just what bear-<lb/>
ing this may have had on the subsequent course of the fever, we can<lb/>
not say, but since <hi>so much stress is laid on absolute rest of the patient<lb/>
by those having most experience in the treatment of yellow fever, the<lb/>
influence of this enforced rest, in our case, upon the subsequent<lb/>
course of the attack, was doubtless of much importance</hi>. We reserve<lb/>
a consideration of the clinical side of these cases for a future report.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the experiments above described conclusively<lb/>
demonstrate that an attack of yellow fever may be readily induced<lb/>
in the healthy subject by the bite of mosquitoes (<hi rend="italic">C. fasciatus</hi>) which<lb/>
have been previously contaminated by being fed with the blood of<lb/>
those sick with yellow fever, provided the insects are kept for a suffi-<lb/>
cient length of time after contamination before being applied to the<lb/>
person to be infected.</p>
<p>Our observations do <hi>not confirm Finlay's statement that</hi> the bite<lb/>
of the mosquito <hi>may confer an abortive attack of yellow fever when</hi><lb/>
applied to the healthy subject 2 to 6 days after it has bitten a yellow<lb/>
fever patient. <hi>We have always failed to induce an attack even of<lb/>
the mildest description when we have used mosquitoes within less<lb/>
than 12 days from the time of contamination, although the insects<lb/>
were constantly kept at summer temperature</hi>. We could cite<lb/>
instances where we have applied mosquitoes at intervals of 2, 3, 4,<lb/>
5, 6, 9, and 11 days following the contamination of the insect with<lb/>
the blood of well-marked cases of yellow fever early in the disease<lb/>
without any effect whatever being produced by the bite. Thus in 1<lb/>
case no result followed the bite of 14 mosquitoes which 4 days pre-<lb/>
viously had been contaminated by biting a case of yellow fever on<lb/>
the first day. Again, 7 days later, or 11 days after contamination,<lb/>
the surviving 7 of these insects failed to infect an individual. On<lb/>
the seventeenth day after contamination, however, the bite of 4 of<lb/>
these mosquitoes--all that remained of the original 14--was promptly<lb/>
followed by an attack of yellow fever <hi>in the same individual</hi>. These<lb/>
insects had been kept during the whole of this time at an average<lb/>
temperature of 82&deg; F.</p>
<p>Our observations would seem to indicate that after the parasite<lb/>
has been taken into the mosquito's stomach, a <hi>certain number of<lb/>
days must elapse before the insect is capable of reconveying it to man</hi>.<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
<hi>This period doubtless represents the time required for the parasite<lb/>
to pass from the insect's stomach to its salivary glands, and would<lb/>
appear to be about 12 days in summer weather and most probably<lb/>
about 18 or more days during the cooler winter months</hi>. It follows<lb/>
also that our observations <hi>do not confirm Finlay's opinion that the<lb/>
bite of the contaminated mosquito may confer immunity against</hi> a<lb/>
subsequent attack of yellow fever. In our experience an individual<lb/>
may be bitten on three or more occasions by contaminated mosquitoes<lb/>
without manifesting any symptoms of disturbance to health, and yet<lb/>
promptly sicken with yellow fever within a few days after being<lb/>
bitten by an insect <hi>capable of conveying the infection</hi>.</p>
<p>ACQUIREMENT OF THE DISEASE.</p>
<p>Having shown that yellow fever can be conveyed by the bite of<lb/>
an infected mosquito, it remains to inquire whether this disease<lb/>
can be acquired in any other manner. It has seemed to us that<lb/>
yellow fever, like the several types of malarial fever, might be induced<lb/>
by the injection of blood taken from the general circulation of a<lb/>
patient suffering from this disease. Accordingly we have subjected<lb/>
<hi>four individuals</hi> to this method of infection, <hi>with one negative and<lb/>
three positive</hi> results. Reserving the detailed description of these<lb/>
cases to a <hi>subsequent occasion</hi>, we may state that in one of the posi-<lb/>
tive cases an attack of pronounced yellow fever followed the subcu-<lb/>
taneous injection of 2 c. c. of blood taken from a vein at the bend of<lb/>
the elbow on the <hi>first day of the</hi> disease, the period of incubation<lb/>
being 3 days and 22 hours; in the second case, 1.5 c. c. of blood, taken<lb/>
on the <hi>first day of the</hi> disease and injected in the same manner,<lb/>
brought about an attack within 2 days and 12 hours; while in our<lb/>
third case, the injection of 0.5 c. c. of blood, taken on the <hi>second day</hi><lb/>
of the disease, produced an attack at the end of 41 hours.</p>
<p>In the case mentioned as negative to the blood injection, the sub-<lb/>
sequent inoculation of this individual with mosquitoes already proved<lb/>
to be capable of conveying the disease, also resulted negatively. We<lb/>
think, therefore, that this particular individual, a <hi>Spanish immigrant</hi>,<lb/>
may be considered as one who probably possesses a natural immunity<lb/>
to yellow fever.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in the three cases in which the injection<lb/>
of the blood brought about an attack of yellow fever, careful cultures<lb/>
from the same blood, taken immediately after injection, failed to<lb/>
show the presence of Sanarelli's bacillus.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>
<p>Our observations, therefore, show that the parasite of yellow fever<lb/>
is present in the general and capillary circulation, at least during the<lb/>
early stages of this disease, and that the latter may be conveyed, like<lb/>
the malarial parasite, either by means of the bite of the mosquito or<lb/>
by the injection of blood taken from the general circulation.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> A fourth case of yellow fever, severe in type, has been produced by the subcutaneous injection of 1 c. c.<lb/>
of blood taken from the general circulation on the second day of the disease, the period of incubation being<lb/>
3 days and 1 hour. The patient from whom the blood was obtained was an experimental case which was<lb/>
in turn produced by the injection of blood--0.5 c. c.--derived from a nonexperimental case of fatal yellow<lb/>
fever. As &ldquo;controls,&rdquo; cases 1, 4, 6, and 7 of this report were also injected subcutaneously with 1 c. c. of<lb/>
the same blood without manifesting any symptoms whatever. The blood which produced this fourth<lb/>
case of yellow fever, when transferred at the same time to bouillon tubes in considerable quantities, gave no<lb/>
growth whatever.</p>
<pb n="83" id="S8220091"/>
<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
83</p>
<p>CAN YELLOW FEVER BE PROPAGATED IN ANY OTHER WAY?</p>
<p>We believe that the general consensus of opinion of both the medical<lb/>
profession and the laity is strongly in favor of the conveyance of<lb/>
yellow fever by fomites. The origin of epidemics, devastating in<lb/>
their course, has been frequently attributed to the unpacking of<lb/>
trunks and boxes that contained supposedly infected clothing; and<lb/>
hence the efforts of health authorities, both State and National, are<lb/>
being constantly directed to the thorough disinfection of all clothing<lb/>
and bedding shipped from ports where yellow fever prevails. To<lb/>
such extremes have efforts at disinfection been carried, in order to<lb/>
prevent the importation of this disease into the United States, that<lb/>
during the epidemic season all articles of personal apparel and bedding<lb/>
have been subjected to disinfection, sometimes both at the port of<lb/>
departure and at the port of arrival; and this has been done whether<lb/>
the articles have previously been contaminated by contact with<lb/>
yellow fever patients or not. <hi>The mere fact that the individual has<lb/>
resided, even for a day, in a city where yellow fever is present, has<lb/>
been sufficient cause to subject his baggage to rigid disinfection by<lb/>
the sanitary authorities</hi>.</p>
<p>To determine, therefore, whether clothing and bedding, which<lb/>
have been contaminated by contact with yellow fever patients and<lb/>
their discharges, can convey this disease is <hi>a matter of the utmost<lb/>
importance</hi>. Although <hi>the literature contains many references to<lb/>
the failure of such contaminated articles to cause the disease</hi>, we have<lb/>
considered it advisable to test, by actual experiment on nonimmune<lb/>
human beings, the theory of the conveyance of yellow fever by<lb/>
fomites, since we know of no other way in which this question can<lb/>
ever be finally determined.</p>
<p>For this purpose there was erected at Camp Lazear a small frame<lb/>
house consisting of one room 14 by 20 feet, and known as &ldquo;Building<lb/>
No. 1,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Infected clothing and bedding building.&rdquo; <hi>The cubic<lb/>
capacity of this house was 2,800 feet</hi>. It was tightly ceiled within<lb/>
with &ldquo;tongue and grooved&rdquo; boards, and was well battened on the<lb/>
outside. <hi>It faced to the south</hi> and was provided with <hi>two small<lb/>
windows, each 26 by 34 inches in</hi> size. <hi>These windows were both<lb/>
placed on the south side of the building</hi>, the purpose being to prevent,<lb/>
as much as possible, any thorough circulation of the air within the<lb/>
house. They were closed by <hi>permanent wire</hi> screens of 0.5 mm.<lb/>
mesh. <hi>In addition sliding glass sash were provided within and heavy<lb/>
wooden shutters without</hi>; the latter intended to prevent the entrance<lb/>
of sunlight into the building, as it was deemed undesirable that the<lb/>
disinfecting qualities of sunlight, direct or diffused, should at any<lb/>
time be exerted on the articles of clothing contained within this room.<lb/>
<hi>Entrance was effected through a small vestibule, 3 by 5</hi> feet, also<lb/>
placed on the <hi>southern side of the house. This vestibule was pro-<lb/>
tected without by a solid door and was divided in its middle by a<lb/>
wire screen door, swung on spring hinges. The inner entrance was<lb/>
also closed by a second wire screen door</hi>. In this way the passage<lb/>
of mosquitoes into this room was effectually excluded. During<lb/>
the day, and until after sunset, the house was kept securely closed,<lb/>
while by means of a <hi>suitable heating apparatus</hi> the temperature was<lb/>
raised from <hi>92&deg; to 95&deg; F</hi>. Precaution was taken at the same time to<lb/>
maintain a sufficient humidity of the atmosphere. The average<lb/>
<pb n="84" id="S8220092"/>
84<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
temperature of this house was thus kept at 76.2&deg; F. for a period<lb/>
of 63 days.</p>
<p><hi>November 30, 1900</hi>, the building now being ready for occupancy,<lb/>
three large boxes filled with sheets, pillow slips, blankets, etc., con-<lb/>
taminated by contact with cases of yellow fever and their discharges<lb/>
were received and placed therein. The majority of the articles had<lb/>
been taken from the beds of patients sick with yellow fever at Las<lb/>
Animas Hospital, Habana, or at Columbia Barracks. Many of them<lb/>
had been purposely soiled with a liberal quantity of black vomit,<lb/>
urine, and fecal matter. A dirty &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; and much-soiled<lb/>
pair of blankets, removed from the bed of a patient sick with yellow<lb/>
fever in the town of Quemados, were contained in one of these boxes.<lb/>
The same day, at 6 p. m., Dr. R. P. Cooke, acting assistant surgeon,<lb/>
United States Army, and <hi>two privates</hi> of the Hospital Corps, all non-<lb/>
immune young Americans, entered this building and deliberately<lb/>
unpacked these boxes, which had been tightly closed and locked for<lb/>
a period of two weeks. They were careful at the same time to give<lb/>
each article a thorough handling and shaking in order to disseminate<lb/>
through the air of the room the specific agent of yellow fever, if con-<lb/>
tained in these fomites. <hi>These soiled sheets, pillow cases, and<lb/>
blankets were used in preparing the beds in which the members of<lb/>
the Hospital Corps slept</hi>. Various soiled articles were hung around<lb/>
the room and placed <hi>about the bed</hi> occupied by Dr. Cooke.</p>
<p>From this date until December 19, 1900, a series of <hi>20 days</hi>, this<lb/>
room was occupied each night by these three nonimmunes. Each<lb/>
morning the various soiled articles were carefully packed in the afore-<lb/>
said boxes, and at night again unpacked and distributed about the<lb/>
room. <hi>During the day the residents of this house were permitted to<lb/>
occupy a tent pitched in the immediate vicinity, but were kept in<lb/>
strict quarantine</hi>.</p>
<p>December 12, a fourth box of clothing and bedding was received<lb/>
from Las Animas Hospital. These articles had been used on the beds<lb/>
of yellow-fever patients, but in addition had been purposely soiled<lb/>
with the bloody stools of a fatal case of this disease. As this box<lb/>
had been packed for a number of days, when opened and unpacked<lb/>
by Dr. Cooke and his assistants, on December 12, <hi>the odor was so<lb/>
offensive as to compel them to retreat from the house</hi>. They pluckily<lb/>
returned, however, within a short time and spent the night as usual.</p>
<p>December 19, these three nonimmunes were placed in quarantine<lb/>
for 5 days and then given the liberty of the camp. All had remained<lb/>
in perfect health, notwithstanding their stay of <hi>20 nights</hi> amid such<lb/>
unwholesome surroundings.</p>
<p>During the week, December 20-27, the following articles were also<lb/>
placed in this house, viz: Pajama suits, 1; undershirts, 2; nightshirts,<lb/>
4; pillow slips, 4; sheets, 6; blankets, 5; pillows, 2; mattresses, 1.<lb/>
These articles had been removed from the persons and beds of four<lb/>
patients sick with yellow fever and were very much soiled, as any<lb/>
<hi>change of clothing or bed linen during their attacks had been pur-<lb/>
posely avoided, the object being to obtain articles as thoroughly<lb/>
contaminated as possible</hi>.</p>
<p>From December 21, 1900, till January 10, 1901, this building was<lb/>
again occupied by two nonimmune young Americans under the same<lb/>
conditions as the preceding occupants, except that <hi>these men slept</hi><lb/>
<pb n="85" id="S8220093"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
85<lb/>
<hi>every night in the very garments worn by yellow-fever patients<lb/>
throughout their entire attacks, besides making use exclusively of<lb/>
their much-soiled pillow slips, sheets, and blankets</hi>. At the end of<lb/>
21 nights of such intimate contact with these fomites, they also went<lb/>
into quarantine, from which they were released 5 days later in per-<lb/>
fect health.</p>
<p>From January 11 till January 31, a period of <hi>20 days</hi>, &ldquo;Building<lb/>
No. 1&rdquo; continued to be occupied by two other nonimmune Amer-<lb/>
icans, who, like those who preceded them, have slept every night in<lb/>
the beds formerly occupied by yellow-fever patients and in the night-<lb/>
shirts used by these patients throughout the attack, without change.<lb/>
In addition, during the last 14 nights of their occupancy of this house,<lb/>
they have slept, each night, <hi>with their pillows covered with towels<lb/>
that had been thoroughly soiled with the blood drawn from both the<lb/>
general and capillary circulation, on the first day of the disease, in<lb/>
the case of a well-marked attack of yellow fever</hi>. Notwithstanding<lb/>
this trying ordeal, these men have continued to remain in perfect<lb/>
health.</p>
<p>The attempt which we have therefore made to infect &ldquo;Building<lb/>
No. 1&rdquo; and its <hi>7 nonimmune occupants</hi>, during a period of 63 days,<lb/>
has proved an absolute failure. We think we can not do better here<lb/>
than to quote from the classic work of La Roche.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> This author says:</p>
<p>In relation to the yellow fever, we find so many instances establishing the fact of the<lb/>
nontransmissibiliity of the disease through the agency of articles of the kind mentioned,<lb/>
and of merchandise generally, that we can not but discredit the accounts of a contrary<lb/>
character assigned in medical writings, and still more to those presented on the strength<lb/>
of popular report solely. For if in a large number of well authenticated cases such<lb/>
articles have been handled and used with perfect impunity--and that, too, often under<lb/>
circumstances best calculated to insure the effect in question--we have every reason<lb/>
to conclude that a contrary result will not be obtained in other instances of a similar<lb/>
kind, and that consequently the effect said to have been produced by exposure to those<lb/>
articles must--unless established beyond the possibility of doubt--be referred to some<lb/>
other agency.</p>
<p>The question here naturally arises: How does a house become<lb/>
infected with yellow fever ? This we have attempted to solve by<lb/>
the erection at Camp Lazear of a second house, known as &ldquo;Building<lb/>
No. 2,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Infected mosquito building,&rdquo; This was in all<lb/>
respects similar to &ldquo;Building No. 1,&rdquo; except that the door and<lb/>
<hi>windows were placed on opposite sides of the building</hi> so as to give<lb/>
through-and-through ventilation. It was divided, also, by a wire-<lb/>
screen partition, extending from floor to ceiling, into two rooms,<lb/>
<hi>12 by 14 feet and 8 by 14 feet, respectively</hi>. Whereas, all articles<lb/>
admitted to &ldquo;Building No. 1&rdquo; have been soiled by contact with<lb/>
yellow-fever patients, all articles admitted to &ldquo;Building No. 2&rdquo; were<lb/>
first carefully disinfected by steam before being placed therein.</p>
<p>On December 21, 1900, at 11.45 a. m., there were set free in the<lb/>
large room of this building <hi>15 mosquitoes</hi> (<hi rend="italic">C. fasciatus</hi>) which had<lb/>
previously been contaminated by biting yellow-fever patients, as<lb/>
follows : One, a severe case, on the second day, November 27, 1900,<lb/>
24 days; 3, a well-marked case, on the first day, December 9, 1900,<lb/>
12 days; 4, a mild case, on the first day, December 13, 1900, 8 days;<lb/>
7, a well-marked case, on the first day, December 16, 1900, 5 days--<lb/>
total, 15.</p>

<p>Only one of these insects was <hi>considered capable of</hi> conveying the<lb/>

insects. At 4.30 p. m., the same day, he again entered and remained<lb/>
<hi>20 minutes</hi>, and was again bitten. The following day, at <hi>4.30 p. m.</hi>,<lb/>
he, for <hi>the third time</hi>, entered the room and was again bitten.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case 7</hi>.--On December 25, 1900, at 6 a. m., the fourth day, Moran complained of<lb/>
slight dizziness and frontal headache. At 11 a. m. he went to bed, complaining of<lb/>
increased headache and malaise, with a temperature of 99.6&deg; F., pulse 88; at noon the<lb/>
temperature was 100.4&deg; F., the pulse 98; at 1 p. m., 101.2&deg; F., the pulse 96, and his<lb/>
eyes were much injected and face suffused. <hi>He was removed to the yellow fever<lb/>
wards</hi>. He was seen on several occasions by the board of experts and the diagnosis of<lb/>
yellow fever confirmed. (See Chart 6.)</p>
<p>The period of incubation in this case, dating from the first visit to<lb/>
&ldquo;Building No. 2,&rdquo; was 3 days and 23 hours. If reckoned from his<lb/>
last visit it was 2 days and 18 hours. There was no other possible<lb/>
source for his infection, as he had been <hi>strictly quarantined at Camp<lb/>
Lazear for a period of 32 days prior to his</hi> exposure in the mosquito<lb/>
building.</p>
<p>During each of Moran's visits, <hi>two nonimmunes</hi> remained in this<lb/>
same building, only protected from the mosquitoes by the wire-screen<lb/>
partition. From December 21, 1900, till January 8, 1901, inclusive--<lb/>
18 nights--these nonimmunes have slept in this house, only protected<lb/>
by the wire-screen partition. These men have remained in perfect<lb/>
health to the present time.</p>
<p>December 28, after an interval of 7 days, <hi>this house was again<lb/>
entered by a nonimmune American</hi>, who remained 25 minutes. The<lb/>
subject was bitten by only one insect. <hi>The following day he again<lb/>
entered and remained 15 minutes</hi>, and was again bitten by one<lb/>
mosquito. <hi>The result of these two visits was entirely negative</hi>. As<lb/>
the mortality among the insects in this room, from some unknown<lb/>
cause, had been surprisingly large, it is possible that the subject was<lb/>
bitten by insects not more than 13 days old, in which case they would<lb/>
probably not infect, since they had been kept for only 5 days at a tem-<lb/>
perature of 82&deg; F., and for 8 days at the mean temperature of the<lb/>
room, 78&deg; F.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, nothing can be more striking or instructive as<lb/>
bearing upon the cause of house infection in yellow fever than when<lb/>
we contrast the results obtained in our attempts to infect Buildings<lb/>
No. 1 and No. 2; for whereas in the former all of 7 nonimmunes<lb/>
escaped the infection, although exposed to the most intimate contact<lb/>
with the fomites for an <hi>average period of 21 nights each, in the latter<lb/>
an exposure, reckoned by as many minutes, was quite sufficient to<lb/>
give an attack of yellow fever to one out of two persons who entered<lb/>
the building--50 per cent</hi>.</p>
<p>Thus, at Camp Lazear, of 7 nonimmunes whom we attempted to<lb/>
infect by means of the bites of contaminated mosquitoes, we have<lb/>
succeeded in conveying the disease to 6, or 85.71 per cent. On the<lb/>
<pb n="87" id="S8220095"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
87<lb/>
other hand, 7 nonimmunes whom we tried to infect by means of<lb/>
fomites, under particularly favorable circumstances, we did not<lb/>
succeed in a single instance. <hi>Out of a total of 18 nonimmunes whom<lb/>
we have inoculated with contaminated mosquitoes since we began<lb/>
this line of investigation, 8, or 44.4 per cent, have contracted yellow<lb/>
fever</hi>. If we exclude those individuals bitten by mosquitoes that<lb/>
had been kept <hi>less than 12 days after contamination</hi>, and which were,<lb/>
therefore, probably incapable of conveying the disease, we have to<lb/>
record 8 positive and 2 negative results--80 per cent.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS.</p>
<p>1. The mosquito (<hi rend="italic"><hi>C. fasciatus</hi></hi>) serves as the intermediate host for<lb/>
the parasite of yellow fever.</p>
<p>2. Yellow fever is transmitted to the nonimmune individual by<lb/>
means of the bite of the mosquito that has previously fed on the<lb/>
blood of those sick with this disease.</p>
<p>3. An interval of <hi>about 12 days or more</hi> after contamination<lb/>
appears to be necessary before the mosquito is capable of conveying<lb/>
the infection.</p>
<p>4. The bite of the mosquito at an earlier period after contamina-<lb/>
tion does not appear to confer any immunity against a subsequent<lb/>
attack.</p>
<p>5. Yellow fever can also be experimentally produced by the sub-<lb/>
cutaneous injection of blood taken from the general circulation<lb/>
during the <hi>first and second days of this</hi> disease.</p>
<p>6. An attack of yellow fever, produced by the bite of the mosquito,<lb/>
confers immunity against the subsequent injection of the blood of an<lb/>
individual suffering from the nonexperimental form of this disease.</p>
<p>7. <hi>The period of incubation in 13 cases of experimental yellow<lb/>
fever has varied from 41 hours to 5 days and 17 hours</hi>.</p>
<p>8. Yellow fever is not conveyed by fomites, and hence disinfection<lb/>
of articles of clothing, bedding, or merchandise, supposedly contam-<lb/>
inated by contact with those sick with this disease, is unnecessary.</p>
<p>9. A house may be said to be infected with yellow fever only when<lb/>
there are present within its walls contaminated mosquitoes capable<lb/>
of conveying the parasite of this disease.</p>
<p>10. The spread of yellow fever can be most effectually controlled<lb/>
by measures directed to the destruction of mosquitoes and the pro-<lb/>
tection of the sick against the bites of these insects.</p>
<p>11. While the mode of propagation of yellow fever has now been<lb/>
definitely determined, the specific cause of this disease remains to be<lb/>
discovered.</p>
<p>DISCUSSION.</p>
<p>Dr. Louis Perna, Cienfuegos, Cuba, in opening the discussion, said<lb/>
that it is sophism to believe that post hoc, ergo propter hoc; that is to<lb/>
say, that, as Carmona, Freire, Sanarelli, and others have fallen to<lb/>
this error, we must not be too precipitate in accepting the result<lb/>
of statistics. <hi>The studies made of mosquitoes are very old</hi>. A<lb/>
<hi>French physician</hi>, who died about 1850, expressed the opinion that<lb/>
malaria, yellow fever, and cholera were propagated by mosquitoes.<lb/>
Dr. Perna also criticized the methods employed by the commission<lb/>
<pb n="88" id="S8220096"/>
88<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
in making experiments on human beings and <hi>is entirely opposed</hi> to<lb/>
such experiments.</p>
<p>Dr. San Martin eloquently defended, and with strong arguments,<lb/>
the high scientific standard of the experiments as carried out by this<lb/>
commission, and also brought out the point that it was not statistics<lb/>
but facts that this commission presented.</p>
<p>Dr. H. B. Horlbeck, Charleston, S. C., expressed his opinion that<lb/>
the problem of 200 years was about to be solved, that the old quar-<lb/>
antine regulations should be greatly modified. He also described<lb/>
the existence of a pine belt within a short distance of Charleston,<lb/>
S. C., in which yellow fever never developed as an epidemic, although<lb/>
the afflicted therewith would go there during the existence of the<lb/>
epidemic in Charleston, would die from the disease, and yet it would<lb/>
not spread. Mosquitoes are not known in that region, and probably<lb/>
this is the true explanation of the above fact. He concluded by<lb/>
emphasizing the inestimable value of these experiments <hi>if they prove<lb/>
to be true</hi>.</p>
<p>Dr. Emilio Martinez, Habana, laid emphasis on Dr. San Martin's<lb/>
views. He took up the moral question and claimed that without<lb/>
these no truth could have been found.</p>
<p>Dr. Manuel Gutierrez, Mexico, who up to within a short time had<lb/>
been adverse to the theory of the transmission of this disease by<lb/>
mosquitoes, now accepted as incontrovertible the results of the experi-<lb/>
ments <hi>of the commission</hi>. He followed with interest many of the<lb/>
experiments, and <hi>as a member of the commission saw</hi> most of these<lb/>
cases, which he had no hesitation in pronouncing typical cases of<lb/>
yellow fever. A fact which impressed him forcibly was the absolute<lb/>
control of the epidemic by Dr. Reed. <hi>The cases would develop or<lb/>
not, as he wished</hi>. He does not think that the mosquito should be<lb/>
called the <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi>. Giles's description of the <hi rend="italic">Culex tiniads</hi><lb/>
mosquito agrees more closely than with the <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi>. He<lb/>
describes the difference between them. He is inclined to consider<lb/>
them a genus apart because they lay different eggs.</p>
<p><hi>Dr. C. Finlay, Habana</hi>, expressed his admiration for the work of<lb/>
the commission. He believes that this session of the congress will go<lb/>
down in history as of great importance and that the <hi>differences<lb/>
between his opinion and that held by the commission will disappear<lb/>
in the course of time</hi>. He states that they were based on the fact<lb/>
that he investigated with <hi>three varieties of mosquitoes</hi>, while the<lb/>
commission has been restricted to one variety; that the board was<lb/>
placed on better footing for obtaining satisfactory results; that the<lb/>
negative result obtained by the inoculation of mosquitoes of short<lb/>
infection should not induce the commission or the board to make<lb/>
such hard and biased rules as are evidenced in its conclusions.</p>
<p><hi>Dr. Reed, in</hi> conclusion, said he was profoundly impressed with<lb/>
the interest and attention given to these experiments. In regard to<lb/>
the moral aspect of the case, <hi>he did not think that anyone appreciated<lb/>
the position in which he found himself</hi>--the difficulties that beset<lb/>
his path. The first experiment was made on a member of the board,<lb/>
Dr. Carroll. <hi>The senior member expected to take his bite in turn,<lb/>
but was unexpectedly called north</hi>. As no animal could be given<lb/>
the disease, and it was useless to follow the previous indefinite experi-<lb/>
ments, it was absolutely necessary to make these experiments on<lb/>
human subjects, or otherwise volumes could have been written and<lb/>
<pb n="89" id="S8220097"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
89<lb/>
discussed, and yet we would have been no nearer the truth than at first.<lb/>
No progress could have been made toward an exact knowledge of the<lb/>
disease unless human subjects had been used. <hi>All experiments were<lb/>
performed on persons who had given their free consent</hi>.</p>
<p>In reference to the remarks of Dr. Holbeck, of Charleston, the dis-<lb/>
infection of vessels should by no means be dispensed with, but only<lb/>
of such articles as bedding and clothing, though it is necessary to get<lb/>
rid of the mosquitoes, and this simplified the process of disinfection.</p>
<p>In regard to the remarks of Dr. Gutierrez, in reference to the name<lb/>
of the mosquito, Dr. Howard, of Baltimore, told him that <hi rend="italic">Culex<lb/>
fasciatus</hi> is identical with <hi rend="italic">Culex tiniads</hi> as described by Giles. Theo-<lb/>
bolt separates <hi rend="italic">Culex tiniads</hi> from the genus <hi rend="italic">Culex</hi> and places it in a<lb/>
new genus, <hi><hi rend="italic">Stegamina</hi></hi>. These lay their eggs in a peculiar way, and<lb/>
there is also a difference in the anterior claws of the male insect from<lb/>
those of the other <hi rend="italic">Culex</hi>. There is also a difference in the larva of<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi>. It is very interesting also to note the fact that<lb/>
<hi>this is the very mosquito that Dr. Finlay used in his experiments<lb/>
and that this particular mosquito does not belong to the genus <hi rend="italic">Culex</hi></hi>;<lb/>
therefore malaria has a genus of its own, <hi rend="italic">Anopheles</hi>, and <hi>yellow fever<lb/>
the genus <hi rend="italic">Stegamina</hi></hi>.</p>

<p>MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE FACULTY: If, upon<lb/>
receipt of your kind invitation to be present with you to-night my<lb/>
first impulse was to decline, I beg that you will not attribute this<lb/>
to any want of appreciation on my part of the honor conferred, but<lb/>
solely to my desire to avoid what I felt would be a very embarrassing<lb/>
position should I attempt to follow in the footsteps of the dis-<lb/>
tinguished gentlemen whom you have invited to fill this position<lb/>
from year to year. Recognizing in them, as all willing leaders do,<lb/>
leaders in the profession, who, by their well-considered addresses,<lb/>
have been able to add so much to the scientific interest of your<lb/>
annual meetings, I could but feel that the burden which you proposed<lb/>
to put upon me was greater than I could bear. That, nevertheless,<lb/>
I am here in the capacity of <hi>your annual speaker</hi> is due to my unwill-<lb/>
ingness even to appear disobliging to this old and honorable <hi>asso-<lb/>
ciation of physicians</hi>, among whose number I find included some<lb/>
of my most valued friends; friends who in years gone by have labored<lb/>
so faithfully to <hi>instill into my mind the value of the scientific method</hi>,<lb/>
but to whom I have been able to make such small return. If, there-<lb/>
fore, I drew some encouragement from the feeling that I should not<lb/>
be wholly among strangers, I found yet more in the thought that<lb/>
such an <hi>eminent body of physicians</hi> as this faculty must ever be<lb/>
willing to welcome any contribution that promises to shed light<lb/>
upon a subject hitherto enshrouded in darkness, and which thereby<lb/>
holds out the prospect of an addition to our knowledge in the larger<lb/>
field of preventive medicine.</p>
<p>In the hope that what I have to say to-night may contribute to<lb/>
the solution of a <hi>somewhat obscure problem</hi>, and may assist us<lb/>
hereafter in the struggle with a grave epidemic disease, I have con-<lb/>
cluded to present for your consideration &ldquo;The propagation of yellow<lb/>
fever, based on recent researches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before proceeding to the discussion of this subject, it is fitting that<lb/>
I should pay brief tribute to the memory of <hi>a former member of<lb/>
this faculty</hi>, the late Dr. Jesse W. Lazear, United States Army. I<lb/>
can hardly trust myself to speak of my late colleague, since the men-<lb/>
tion of his name brings back such <hi>scenes of anxiety and depression<lb/>
as one recalls only with pain. Along with these sad memories,<lb/>
however, come other recollections of a manly and fearless devotion</hi><lb/>
to duty such as I have never seen equaled. In the discharge of<lb/>
the latter, Dr. Lazear seemed absolutely tireless and <hi>quite oblivious</hi></p>

<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Address delivered at the One hundred and third annual meeting of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty<lb/>
of the State of Maryland, held at Baltimore, April 24-27, <hi>1901</hi>.</p>

<p><hi>of self</hi>. Filled with an earnest enthusiasm for the advancement of<lb/>
his profession and for the cause of science, he let no opportunity<lb/>
pass unimproved. <hi>Although the evening might find him discouraged<lb/>
over the difficult problem at hand, with the morning's return he<lb/>
again took up the task full of eagerness and hope</hi>. During a service<lb/>
of less than one year in Cuba he won the good will and respect of<lb/>
his brother officers and the affection of his immediate associates.<lb/>
Almost at the beginning of what promised to be a life full of usefulness<lb/>
and good works he was suddenly stricken, and, dying, <hi>added one<lb/>
more name to that imperishable roll of honor to which none others<lb/>
belong than martyrs to the cause of humanity</hi>.</p>
<p>It is my own earnest wish that, whatever credit may be hereafter<lb/>
given to the work of the American commission in Cuba during the<lb/>
past year, the <hi>name of my late colleague, Dr. Lazear, may be always<lb/>
associated therewith</hi>.</p>
<p>I do not propose to set before you this evening so much the views<lb/>
of others in relation to the etiology of yellow fever, or to the conditions<lb/>
under which it originates and spreads, as to give you the results of<lb/>
<hi>my own experience</hi> with regard to the manner in which this disease<lb/>
propagates itself. In the <hi>ordinary course of Army</hi> administration, I<lb/>
found myself brought in contact with yellow fever <hi>during the sum-<lb/>
mer of 1900, under such circumstances as permitted me to give my<lb/>
entire time to the study of its etiology and propagation</hi>. Permit me<lb/>
here to remark that so many claims have been made as to the specific<lb/>
cause of yellow fever--claims that could not be confirmed by other<lb/>
investigators--that one must needs feel considerable hesitancy in<lb/>
considering this remarkable disease from any aspect. I must con-<lb/>
fess that I have experienced, in the highest degree, this feeling of<lb/>
reluctance to write or speak about yellow fever, especially when I<lb/>
recall the frame of mind of myself and my colleagues--that of utter<lb/>
<hi>perplexity and wonder</hi>--as we stood by the bedside of patients, or at<lb/>
the autopsy table of those who had died of this mysterious malady.<lb/>
I trust, therefore, that whatever I may say here to-night will be<lb/>
considered as a modest expression of opinion growing out of an<lb/>
unprejudiced study of yellow fever, for the most part from the point<lb/>
of view of its propagation.</p>
<p>Although considerable attention had been given to the laboratory<lb/>
study of the microorganisms isolated by Sternberg and Sanarelli<lb/>
from the organs of yellow-fever cadavers, this did not enable one to<lb/>
form any opinion concerning the nature of the disease or the mode<lb/>
of its propagation.</p>
<p>At the time of our arrival in Cuba--June, 1900--the situation as<lb/>
regards the etiology of yellow fever may be briefly stated as follows:<lb/>
<hi>The claims of all investigators for the discovery of</hi> the specific agent<lb/>
of this disease had been <hi>disproved by the exhaustive</hi> work of Stern-<lb/>
berg,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> published in 1890, <hi>except that made by Dr. Sanarelli, in June,<lb/>
1897, for his <hi rend="italic">bacillus icteroides</hi></hi>. I need not take up time here with<lb/>
mention of those who had investigated Sanarelli's claim, except to<lb/>
state that the confirmation of his discovery came chiefly from workers<lb/>
in the United States, of whom I may speak of <hi>Achinard and Woodson</hi>,<lb/>
of New Orleans, and especially of <hi>Wasdin and Geddings</hi>, of the</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Report on the Etiology and Prevention of Yellow Fever, 1890.</p>
<pb n="92" id="S8220100"/>
<p>92<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>Marine-Hospital Service. The latter,in a report<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> submitted during the<lb/>
summer of 1899, accepted in the fullest Sanarelli's claim for the<lb/>
specific character of <hi rend="italic">bacillus icteroides</hi>, basing their confirmation on<lb/>
the finding of this bacillus in 13 out of 14 cases of yellow fever studied<lb/>
by them in the city of Habana. Under these circumstances, it was<lb/>
of the first importance that we should give our entire time to the<lb/>
search for <hi rend="italic">bacillus icteroides</hi> in the bodies of yellow-fever cases. The<lb/>
result of this study, <hi>embracing 21 cases during</hi> life and 11 autopsies,<lb/>
and which was entirely negative, has already been given in our<lb/>
Preliminary Note,<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> read at the last meeting of the American Public<lb/>
Health Association (1900).</p>
<p>Turning for a moment to our knowledge concerning the mode of<lb/>
propagation of yellow fever, the situation, when we began work, was<lb/>
about as follows: The battle for or against its importation having been<lb/>
already decided in favor of the former belief, its transmissibility from<lb/>
place to place was attributed to the individual affected by the disease,<lb/>
but especially <hi>to his clothing</hi>; with the proviso, however, that<lb/>
intimately connected with its spread <hi>was involved a proper constitu-<lb/>
tion of the atmosphere of the place</hi>, this latter due <hi>chiefly to insani-<lb/>
tary conditions of soil</hi>. That the excreta of the patient contained<lb/>
the specific agent of the disease was supported by many good authori-<lb/>
ties. <hi>That the disease could be propagated by fomites was not dis-<lb/>
puted by anyone</hi>. Against its spread by the sick and by fomites all<lb/>
quarantine measures were being then directed.</p>
<p>The theory of Finlay for the propagation of yellow fever by the<lb/>
mosquito, concerning which I shall presently have something to say,<lb/>
<hi>had either gained no credence or been rejected by reason of the absence<lb/>
of any results that had been presented by its author in support of it</hi>.<lb/>
In the meantime, and before we had completed our search for<lb/>
Sanarelli's bacillus, certain facts had been cropping out, as it were,<lb/>
which served to arrest the attention. Just here, while mentioning<lb/>
the first fact, let me say that one <hi>does not like to confess his ignorance</hi><lb/>
of such a well-known disease as yellow fever, especially before an<lb/>
audience some of whose members may have already treated cases<lb/>
during the last epidemic in this city, in the year 1876; and yet candor<lb/>
compels me to record my <hi>very great surprise, when brought face to<lb/>
face with yellow fever, to</hi> learn that <hi>attendance on patients by non-<lb/>
immune nurses, in every stage of the malady, involved no danger</hi>.<lb/>
In other words, that yellow fever, both in the wards at <hi>Columbia</hi><lb/>
Barracks, as well as in the wards of <hi>Las Animas Hospital, Habana</hi>,<lb/>
was not contracted by the attendants under circumstances such as<lb/>
those in which typhoid fever and Asiatic cholera are too often con-<lb/>
veyed. <hi>Further inquiry along this line seemed</hi> to indicate that the<lb/>
disease had not been contracted in hospitals, even during the earlier<lb/>
epidemics, when disinfection of articles of clothing and bedding was<lb/>
unknown.</p>
<p><hi>A second fact</hi> which appeared worthy of note, was the discharge of<lb/>
patients from the wards during early convalescence, and their return<lb/>
to the companionship of their comrades with apparently no danger<lb/>
of establishing fresh foci of the disease. This hardly seemed in<lb/>
keeping with the presence of a specific agent in the excreta of the sick.</p>
<p><hi>A third fact</hi> which stood out prominently was that, in certain of<lb/>
our cases, no growth whatever was obtained on our present laboratory</p>

<p>media, either by frequent cultures taken from the blood during life<lb/>
or from the organs after death. In other words, no bacterium was<lb/>
obtainable by aerobic methods, in certain of our cases, either during<lb/>
life or after death. This result had considerable weight in controlling<lb/>
our future work.</p>
<p>During the time that these cases were being studied, opportunity<lb/>
was afforded to investigate an epidemic of fever which was prevailing<lb/>
in <hi>Pinar del Rio Barracks, near the town of this name</hi>, distant 110<lb/>
miles from Habana, and of which fever <hi>several soldiers, in a garrison<lb/>
of about 900 men, had already died</hi>. A visit was made to this garrison<lb/>
with my colleague, Dr. Agramonte, on the <hi>31st day of July, 1900,<lb/>
and a body sectioned the same afternoon</hi>. The lesions found were<lb/>
those of yellow fever. Inquiry showed that under the diagnosis of<lb/>
&ldquo;remittent malarial fever&rdquo; or &ldquo;pernicious malarial fever,&rdquo; the disease<lb/>
had been prevailing for at least <hi>37 days prior to our arrival</hi>--July 21--<lb/>
and that about <hi>35 cases had been under treatment in the</hi> post hospital,<lb/>
<hi>of which number 11 had died</hi>. As the true nature of the disease had<lb/>
not been suspected, <hi>no precautionary measures</hi> had been taken as<lb/>
regards the disinfection of bedding and clothing used by the patients,<lb/>
except that in case of death the sheets and pillow slips were put in<lb/>
bichloride solution and the mattresses and pillow exposed to sun-<lb/>
light. An order required that the excreta of all patients under treat-<lb/>
ment in this hospital should be carefully disinfected, and this was<lb/>
probably carried out fairly well. The excreta for the garrison at large<lb/>
were incinerated in permanent crematories, fires being lighted in<lb/>
these twice a week.</p>
<p><hi>Notwithstanding the omission to disinfect the bulk</hi> of the contami-<lb/>
nated articles of bedding and clothing, <hi>the disease had not been<lb/>
contracted by the nurses, nor by the other patients</hi> in the several<lb/>
wards, nor by the three men who washed all of these articles. A<lb/>
little inquiry showed that contaminated clothing was in all of the<lb/>
<hi>eight barrack rooms without</hi> apparent detriment to the occupants.<lb/>
Further investigation showed that a death from yellow fever had<lb/>
occurred in this garrison as early as <hi>May 16, 1900</hi>, and that the source<lb/>
of infection for this case, as well as for the present outbreak, was in the<lb/>
immediately adjacent town of <hi>Pinar del Rio</hi>, to which the soldiers<lb/>
had free access.</p>
<p><hi>An interesting observation</hi> was the sudden attack of yellow fever<lb/>
experienced on <hi>July 12, 1900</hi>, by a <hi>general prisoner</hi> who had been<lb/>
confined in a cell in the guardhouse <hi>since June 6, 1900</hi>. <hi>His death</hi><lb/>
occurred at the post hospital on <hi>July 18, 1900</hi>. This cell was occupied<lb/>
at the time by <hi>eight other prisoners</hi>, none of whom contracted the<lb/>
disease, although one of them continued to occupy the bunk vacated<lb/>
by the sick man. As these nine prisoners had been kept under strict<lb/>
military guard, it was impossible that the individual attacked could<lb/>
have acquired his infection in the town of Pinar del Rio. He was, as<lb/>
far as could be ascertained, exposed to no source of infection to which<lb/>
his companions had not been equally exposed, and yet he alone<lb/>
acquired the disease. <hi>It was conjectured at the time that perhaps<lb/>
some insect capable of conveying the infection, such as the mosquito</hi>,<lb/>
had entered through the cell window, bitten this particular prisoner,<lb/>
and then passed out. This was, however, only a supposition.</p>
<p>Two instances of undoubted exposure to fomites, involving four<lb/>
individuals, came under my observation during this inspection. In<lb/>

packed for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles, and<lb/>
carefully repacked on July 18 by two nonimmune soldiers, who did<lb/>
not contract the disease by this exposure. In the other case the<lb/>
very bed vacated on July 18 by the commissary sergeant, who was<lb/>
taken sick on July 17, and died on July 21, was occupied by a<lb/>
nonimmune soldier on the nights of the 19th and 20th of July.<lb/>
<hi>Although this individual was badly frightened when the</hi> true character<lb/>
<hi>of the sergeant's attack was announced, the</hi>, the combination of fright<lb/>
and exposure to fomites was not sufficient to produce an attack of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>The data gathered, therefore, during the investigation of this small<lb/>
epidemic at Pinar del Rio did not tend to strengthen one's belief in<lb/>
the theory of the propagation of yellow fever by fomites. This belief<lb/>
had already been shaken by the manner in which the disease had<lb/>
spread in the town of Quemados, Cuba, from which we had obtained<lb/>
cases for bacteriologic study; for here <hi>we saw the disease pass from<lb/>
No. 102 Real Street around the corner to No. 20 General Lee Street,<lb/>
and thence to a house immediately across this latter street</hi>, without<lb/>
the passage of any persons between these three houses, and to the<lb/>
exclusion of any article of clothing, as the three families had no<lb/>
acquaintance whatever with each other. <hi>Here the infection was<lb/>
just as plainly carried through the air as it had been taken, through<lb/>
this medium, to the prisoner in the cell at Pinar del Rio. We also</hi><lb/>
observed in this town that the contagion <hi>passed down General Lee<lb/>
Street with a bound to the distance of a square, passing in its journey<lb/>
a house containing two</hi> nonimmunes, only to return a few days later<lb/>
to this very house and seize upon <hi>both of its nonimmune inmates</hi>.<lb/>
This hardly seemed in keeping with the idea of a diffusible poison<lb/>
carried by the atmosphere. During our first week on the island,<lb/>
we noted in <hi>a house in Quemados, where the husband and wife were<lb/>
taken down with yellow fever a few days apart, that</hi> neither <hi>the<lb/>
young daughter</hi>, who was removed to a place of safety on the fourth<lb/>
day, nor an attendant who had remained in the sick room for the<lb/>
entire 24 hours of the seventh day, had acquired the disease; but<lb/>
that of the <hi>two remaining nurses who</hi> continued to perform their<lb/>
duties, one was seized on the fourteenth day and the other on the<lb/>
fifteenth day with an attack of yellow fever. This observation was<lb/>
recorded at the time for what it was worth. Later it was found to<lb/>
harmonize with the observations which had been made by Surg.<lb/>
Henry R. Carter, of the Marine-Hospital Service, in 1898. As I shall<lb/>
recur to these observations later in my remarks, it will suffice to here<lb/>
state that <hi>at this stage of our investigation it seemed to me, and I<lb/>
so expressed the opinion to my colleagues, that the time had arrived<lb/>
when the plan of our work should be radically changed; that the<lb/>
search for the specific agent of yellow fever, while not abandoned,<lb/>
should be given secondary consideration, until we had first definitely<lb/>
learned something about the way or ways in which the disease was<lb/>
propagated from the sick to the well</hi>. I felt well-nigh convinced<lb/>
that we could obtain no light whatever upon the task that had been<lb/>
set before us, unless we substituted this line of work for the one we<lb/>
had been pursuing, and that in view of the splendid work of Ross,<lb/>
<pb n="95" id="S8220103"/>

Bignami, and others with regard to the propagation of malarial fever,<lb/>
together with the well-known thermal influences intimately con-<lb/>
nected not only with the epidemiology of the disease in the United<lb/>
States, but also with its endemiology on the Island of Cuba, it was<lb/>
of <hi>the highest importance that the agency of an intermediate host,<lb/>
such as the mosquito, should either be proven or disproven</hi>.</p>
<p>Remember, if you please, that here we were dealing with an epi-<lb/>
demic disease concerning which there was no evidence whatever to<lb/>
show that it had ever been spread by contamination of either water<lb/>
or food; that <hi>it had always demanded a certain elevated tempera-<lb/>
ture before it would begin its progress, which latter, both in its man-<lb/>
ner and rate, was quite unlike that of other epidemic diseases</hi>, such<lb/>
as smallpox or typhoid fever or Asiatic cholera; that once having<lb/>
begun its march, <hi>no hygienic measures ever instituted had been able</hi><lb/>
to arrest its course, except depopulation of the locality affected;<lb/>
that while, if introduced into certain localities, it would readily propa-<lb/>
gate itself, those sick with this disease could be carried in large num-<lb/>
bers into other places without any danger of its spread--a fact which<lb/>
had been attested in hundreds of instances; <hi>that ships with nonim-<lb/>
mune crews could remain at anchor with perfect safety at about 300<lb/>
yards from an infected shore</hi>. Couple with this the natural law by<lb/>
which it was governed, viz, its <hi>prompt control by frost</hi>, and tell me<lb/>
what other epidemic disease could be associated in the mind with<lb/>
this except malarial fever.</p>
<p>The theory that the spread of yellow fever could not be explained<lb/>
by the assumption of a diffusible miasm in the atmosphere, but<lb/>
required the presence of an intermediate host, appears to have been<lb/>
first advanced by <hi>Dr. J. C. Nott, of Mobile, Ala., in March</hi>, 1848.<lb/>
His views were given in full in the New Orleans Medical Journal for<lb/>
that year. It was also in this paper that Nott suggested the <hi>mos-<lb/>
quito as the possible agent in the dissemination of malarial fevers.<lb/>
He evidently did not have in mind the mosquito as the bearer of the<lb/>
yellow-fever poison, but rather that this important office was per-<lb/>
formed by some insect or insects that remained very close to the<lb/>
ground</hi>. Referring to the fact to which all writers were agreed, that<lb/>
a very imperfect barrier, such as a row of houses or of trees, would<lb/>
often protect dwellings from the access of <hi>malarial poison</hi>, he says:</p>
<p>I have been able in my researches to discover no facts of this kind in connection<lb/>
with yellow fever, and my personal observation repudiates this in toto. We never<lb/>
find yellow fever, as the sportsman says, &ldquo;up a tree,&rdquo; but on the contrary the materies<lb/>
morbi, whatever it may be, creeps along the ground, regardless of winds, passing<lb/>
under and through houses and trees, etc., and knowing no impediment but a sheet<lb/>
of water.</p>
<p>Again:</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that from 1829 to 1837 there was no epidemic of yellow fever in<lb/>
Mobile, and during this time the streets were beautifully shelled; since 1837 we have<lb/>
had it five times and the shelling was not continued. If the <hi>insect theory</hi> be correct,<lb/>
could the lime be an impediment to their progress across the street?</p>
<p>To Dr. Carlos J. Finlay, of Habana, must be given, however, full<lb/>
credit for the theory of the propagation of yellow fever by means of<lb/>
the mosquito, which he proposed in a paper read before the <hi>Royal<lb/>
Academy in that city at its session on the 14th day of August, 1881</hi>.<lb/>
From that date to the present time Finlay has made a number of<lb/>
valuable contributions to the origin and mode of transmission and<lb/>
<pb n="96" id="S8220104"/>
96 YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
the prevention of yellow fever. During this time his views have<lb/>
undergone some slight modification. <hi>Starting with the idea that the<lb/>
specific poison adhered to the mosquito's proboscis</hi> and was thus<lb/>
mechanically transferred to the individual next bitten (<hi>which specific<lb/>
agent was claimed by him in 1887, and even at the present time, to be<lb/>
his micrococcus tetragenus febris flav&aelig;), he later--1899--modified<lb/>
his original theory, based upon the studies of Theobald Smith</hi> on<lb/>
Texas fever, &ldquo;so as to include the important circumstances that the<lb/>
faculty of transmitting the yellow-fever germ <hi>need not be limited<lb/>
to the parent insect, directly</hi> contaminated by stinging a yellow-fever<lb/>
patient (or perhaps by contact with or feeding from his discharges),<lb/>
<hi>but may be likewise inherited by the next generation of mosquitoes<lb/>
issued from the contaminated parent</hi>&rdquo; (New York Medical Record,<lb/>
May 27, 1900). <hi>Of the 100 individuals experimented upon from<lb/>
June, 1881, to May, 1895, Finlay</hi> claimed to have produced three<lb/>
cases of &ldquo;mild albuminuric fever&rdquo; after a period of incubation<lb/>
varying from 5 to 25 days; but as he exercised no control over these<lb/>
individuals, to the exclusion of other sources of infection, <hi>no value<lb/>
could be attached to his results</hi>. If, indeed, one were guided by the<lb/>
results obtained, the only logical conclusion to be drawn was that<lb/>
<hi>Finlay had disproved his own theory</hi>. His failure to produce posi-<lb/>
tive results--which we now believe to be due to the fact that he did<lb/>
not keep his insects for a sufficient length of time after contamination<lb/>
before applying them to the individual to be infected--doubtless led<lb/>
Finlay to <hi>promulgate the later idea that the bite of the contaminated<lb/>
mosquito, while not producing the disease, conferred immunity upon<lb/>
the individual bitten</hi>. He has made use of the bite of the contami-<lb/>
nated mosquito for this purpose in a considerable number of indi-<lb/>
viduals. Notwithstanding the fact that <hi>Finlay had no results to<lb/>
show in support of his theory</hi>, and that the <hi>latter had been wholly<lb/>
rejected by other investigators</hi>, the argument in favor of an inter-<lb/>
mediate host seemed so strong, as I have already stated, that <hi>further<lb/>
investigation along this line was determined upon</hi>. The mosquito<lb/>
selected was the one that had been used by Finlay in his previous<lb/>
work, and which, with <hi rend="italic">Culex pungens</hi>, is the most prevalent and<lb/>
annoying mosquito in the city of Habana, and for that matter in all<lb/>
the larger towns on the island. Originally designated by Fabricius<lb/>
as <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi>,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> it had later been called by Desvoidy, <hi rend="italic">Culex<lb/>
mosquito</hi>. <hi>Unlike <hi rend="italic">Culex pungens</hi> this mosquito bites by day as well<lb/>
as during the nighttime</hi>. Judging from my own experience, I should<lb/>
say that its favorite hours for feeding were <hi>from 4 p. m. to 10 p. m.</hi></p>
<p>In our preliminary note, above referred to, we recorded, among 11<lb/>
individuals bitten by contaminated mosquitoes of this species, 9<lb/>
negative and 2 positive results; the attack in both of the latter<lb/>
occurring within the period of incubation of yellow fever. As the<lb/>
circumstances surrounding the infection of one of these cases was<lb/>
such as to exclude any other source of infection, we announced the<lb/>
conclusion that &ldquo;the mosquito served as the intermediate host for<lb/>
the parasite of yellow fever.&rdquo; Subsequent observations have pointed,<lb/>
in the most convincing manner, to the soundness of this conclusion.<lb/>
It is to these later observations that I now desire to invite your<lb/>
attention.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> It is interesting and important to observe that since the publication of our Preliminary Note, Theobold,<lb/>

<p><hi>Dismiss from your minds</hi>, if you please, the idea that <hi>yellow fever<lb/>
is so prevalent on the island of Cuba</hi>, and that the ways of acquiring<lb/>
the disease are so numerous, that experimental results obtained at<lb/>
any point in the so-called endemic zone of yellow fever must be<lb/>
thereby vitiated. Nothing to my mind could be more improbable<lb/>
than such an opinion; for, as a matter of fact, <hi>yellow fever has been<lb/>
confined, during the year 1900, to Habana and a few other towns</hi>,<lb/>
coast or inland, and has not been present elsewhere on the island.<lb/>
<hi>Hence any location selected, provided it should be 1 mile from such<lb/>
a center of infection and surrounded by proper safeguards, would be<lb/>
just as free from the occurrence of yellow fever</hi> as if it were located<lb/>
<hi>10 miles from such a town</hi>. My own experience on the island of<lb/>
Cuba had already taught me that yellow fever could be easily kept<lb/>
out of a military garrison, although prevailing in epidemic form in a<lb/>
town less than 1 mile distant. <hi>For this reason it was not considered<lb/>
advisable to establish our experimental sanitary station at a greater<lb/>
distance than 1 mile from Quemados, Cuba</hi>. Thus Camp Lazear<lb/>
could be easily reached by the members of the board and was con-<lb/>
veniently located as regards its base of supplies. The occurrences at<lb/>
this camp fully justified this decision. <hi>Placed in an open field,<lb/>
which was fairly swept at all times by the prevalent winds, and having</hi><lb/>
a military garrison each of whose members had been personally<lb/>
selected by <hi>reason of former good conduct and interest in the work</hi><lb/>
to be here undertaken, no difficulty whatever was experienced in<lb/>
maintaining the strictest quarantine against the outside.</p>
<p>Let us now present to you, as succinctly as possible, our observa-<lb/>
tions at this camp, prefacing what I shall have to say with the<lb/>
remark that here we proposed to attempt the infection of nonimmune<lb/>
individuals in three ways, viz, first, by the bites of mosquitoes that<lb/>
had previously bitten cases of yellow fever; secondly, by the injec-<lb/>
tion of blood taken during the early stages from the general circula-<lb/>
tion of those suffering with the disease; and, thirdly, by exposure to<lb/>
the most intimate contact with fomites. For this purpose, in addition<lb/>
to the <hi>seven tents</hi> provided for the quartering of the detachment,<lb/>
two frame buildings, each 14 by 20 feet in size, were constructed.<lb/>
These buildings, having a cubic capacity of 2,800 feet, were exactly<lb/>
similar, except that one of them, known as the &ldquo;Infected mosquito<lb/>
building,&rdquo; was divided <hi>near its middle</hi> by a permanent wire-screen<lb/>
partition and had good ventilation; while the other, designated as<lb/>
the &ldquo;Infected clothing building,&rdquo; was purposely so constructed as<lb/>
to exclude anything like efficient ventilation. <hi>These houses were<lb/>
placed on opposite sides of a small valley, about 80 yards apart, and<lb/>
each 75 yards distant from the camp proper</hi>. Both houses were<lb/>
<hi>provided with wire-screen windows and</hi> double wire-screen doors, so<lb/>
that mosquitoes could be kept without or within the buildings, as<lb/>
the experimenter might desire.</p>
<p>At first the results obtained at this station <hi>were not encouraging.<lb/>
From November 20, 1900</hi>, the date of the establishment of the sta-<lb/>
tion, until December 4--a period of 2 weeks--we had tried to infect<lb/>
4 individuals, with entirely negative results. <hi>Two of</hi> these had been<lb/>
bitten twice, at intervals of 3 days, by contaminated mosquitoes<lb/>
which had been kept from 10 to 14 days after they had fed on yellow-<lb/>
fever cases; while the other <hi>2 nonimmunes had been thrice bitten, at</hi><lb/>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
the same intervals, by mosquitoes that had bitten cases of yellow<lb/>
fever 10 to 18 days before. As the weather during this time was cool<lb/>
and the insects had been kept at room temperature (and this is prac-<lb/>
<hi>tically outdoor temperature in Cuba), we conjectured that the nega-<lb/>
tive results might, perhaps, be thus explained</hi>. We remembered that<lb/>
Daniels<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> in repeating, during the winter season, Ross's observations<lb/>
with proteosoma infection of birds, had obtained a much smaller per-<lb/>
centage of successes than had Ross, who worked during summer<lb/>
weather. We would have been glad to draw some encouragement<lb/>
from our negative experiments, also, with infected bedding, but, as<lb/>
at this date (Dec. 4) our 3 subjects had been sleeping with fomites<lb/>
only 4 nights (which is within the period of incubation of the disease),<lb/>
this comfort was debarred.</p>
<p><hi>On the fifteenth day of our encampment therefore (Dec. 5, at 2<lb/>
p. m.) we concentrated our insects, so to speak, on one of these non-<lb/>
immunes--Kissinger by name</hi>--selecting 5 of <hi>our most promising</hi><lb/>
mosquitoes for the purpose. These had been contaminated as fol-<lb/>
follows: Two, 15 days; 1, 19 days; and 2, 21 days previously. This<lb/>
inoculation was more successful, for, at the expiration of 3 days and<lb/>
9 1&sol;2 hours the subject, who had been under strict quarantine during<lb/>
15 days, was suddenly seized with a chill about midnight, <hi>December 8</hi>,<lb/>
which was the beginning of a well-marked attack of yellow fever.</p>
<p>I can not let this opportunity pass without expressing my admi-<lb/>
ration of the conduct of this young Ohio soldier, who volunteered for<lb/>
this experiment, as he expressed it, &ldquo;<hi>solely in the interest of humanity<lb/>
and the cause of science</hi>,&rdquo; and <hi>with the only proviso that he should<lb/>
receive no pecuniary reward</hi>. In my opinion this exhibition of<lb/>
moral courage has never been surpassed in the annals of the Army of<lb/>
the United States.</p>
<p>The following morning (Sunday, Dec. 9, at 10.30 a. m.) we<lb/>
selected from those insects that had bitten Case I, one mosquito that<lb/>
seemed to us to possess the best record of contamination, as it had<lb/>
bitten a fatal case of yellow fever, on the second day of the disease,<lb/>
19 days before. This insect was applied to a Spanish immigrant,<lb/>
who had been strictly quarantined at our station for 19 days. At the<lb/>
expiration of 3 days and 11 hours (Dec. <del>9</del><add>12</add>, 9.30 p. m.) this individual<lb/>
was also seized with an attack of yellow fever.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, on December 8, 1900, at 4 o'clock p. m., we had<lb/>
applied to a young Spaniard three of the mosquitoes that had, three<lb/>
days previously, bitten Case I, together with an additional mosquito<lb/>
contaminated 17 days before. At the end of 4 days and 20 hours<lb/>
(<hi>Dec. 13, noon</hi>) this Spaniard suddenly lost his vivacity and took to<lb/>
his bed. The following morning at 9 a. m. his febrile paroxysm<lb/>
began. His case, which was the mildest of our series, was also marked<lb/>
by a long period of incubation, viz, 5 days and 17 hours. He had<lb/>
been in quarantine 9 days.</p>
<p>December 11, at 4.30 p. m., the identical 4 insects which had bitten<lb/>
Case III were fed on a Spanish immigrant who had been in quarantine<lb/>
for the past 21 days. At the expiration of 3 days and 19 1&sol;2 hours<lb/>
(Dec. 15, noon) he was likewise seized with yellow fever.</p>
<p>Thus within the period of one week--December <del>9</del><add>8</add> to 15--we had<lb/>
succeeded in producing an attack of yellow fever in each of the 4</p>

99</p>
<p>individuals whom we had caused contaminated insects to bite, and<lb/>
in all save 1 of the 5 nonimmunes whom we had originally selected<lb/>
for experimentation.</p>
<p>It can readily be imagined that the concurrence of 4 cases of yellow<lb/>
fever in our small command of 12 nonimmunes within the space of<lb/>
1 week, <hi>while giving rise to feelings of exultation in the hearts of the<lb/>
experimenters, in view of the vast importance attaching to these re-<lb/>
sults, might inspire quite other sentiments in the bosoms of those<lb/>
who had previously consented to submit themselves to the mos-<lb/>
quito's bite. In fact, several of our good-natured Spanish friends</hi><lb/>
who had jokingly compared our mosquitoes to &ldquo;the little flies that<lb/>
buzzed harmlessly about their tables,&rdquo; suddenly appeared to lose all<lb/>
interest in the progress of science, and, forgetting for the moment<lb/>
even their own personal aggrandizement, <hi>incontinently severed their<lb/>
connection with Camp Lazear</hi>. Personally, while lamenting to some<lb/>
extent their departure, I could not but feel that in placing them-<lb/>
selves beyond our control they <hi>were exercising the soundest judgment.<lb/>
In striking contrast to the want of confidence shown by these Anda-<lb/>
lusians who had agreed to be bitten by mosquitoes was the conduct<lb/>
now displayed by the three young Americans, who had consented to<lb/>
jeopardize their lives by exposure to fomites and who, as a matter</hi> of<lb/>
fact, had already spent 15 nights in a small, illy ventilated building,<lb/>
breathing in an atmosphere dreadfully contaminated by the soiled<lb/>
garments of yellow-fever patients. <hi>With the occurrence of these<lb/>
cases of mosquito infection, the countenances of these men, which had<lb/>
before borne the serious aspect of those who were bravely facing an<lb/>
unseen foe, suddenly took on the glad expression of &ldquo;schoolboys let<lb/>
out for a holiday,&rdquo; and from this time their contempt for &ldquo;fomites&rdquo;<lb/>
could not find sufficient expression. Thus illustrating once more,<lb/>
gentlemen, the old adage that familiarity, even with fomites, may<lb/>
breed contempt</hi>.</p>
<p>As the continued good health of those who were occupying the<lb/>
&ldquo; infected clothing building&rdquo; pointed strongly to the harmlessness<lb/>
of fomites, the next experiment at this station was undertaken for the<lb/>
purpose of demonstrating that the essential factor in the infection of<lb/>
a building with yellow fever is the presence therein of mosquitoes that<lb/>
have bitten cases of yellow fever.</p>
<p>Accordingly at 11.55 a. m., December 21, 1900, 15 mosquitoes were<lb/>
freed in the larger room of the &ldquo;infected mosquito building,&rdquo; which,<lb/>
as I have said, was divided into two compartments by a wire-screen<lb/>
partition. The interval that had elapsed since the contamination<lb/>
of these insects was as follows: One, 24 days; three, 12 days; four,<lb/>
8 days; and seven, 5 days. The only articles of furniture in this<lb/>
building consisted of three beds, one being placed in the mosquito<lb/>
room and two beyond the wire screen, these latter intended to be<lb/>
<hi>occupied by two &ldquo;control&rdquo; nonimmunes</hi>. The articles of bedding<lb/>
as well as the bedsteads had been carefully disinfected with steam.<lb/>
At noon on the same day, 5 minutes after the mosquitoes had been<lb/>
placed therein, a <hi>plucky Ohio boy, Moran by name</hi>, clad only in his<lb/>
nightshirt, and fresh from a bath, entered the room containing the<lb/>
mosquitoes, where he lay down for a period of 30 minutes. On the<lb/>
<hi>opposite of the screen were the two &ldquo;controls&rdquo; and one other non-<lb/>
immune</hi>. Within 2 minutes from Moran's entrance he was being<lb/>
bitten about the face and hands by the insects that had promptly<lb/>
<pb n="100" id="S8220108"/>
100<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
settled down upon him. <hi>Seven</hi> in all bit him at this visit. At 4.30<lb/>
p. m., the same day, he again entered and remained 20 minutes,<lb/>
during which time <hi>5 others bit him</hi>. The following day at 4.30 p. m.,<lb/>
he again entered and remained <hi>15 minutes, during</hi> which time <hi>3</hi><lb/>
insects bit him, making the number 15 that had fed at these three<lb/>
visits. <hi>The building was then closed</hi>, except that the <hi>two non-<lb/>
immune &ldquo;controls&rdquo;</hi> continued to occupy the beds on the noninfected<lb/>
side of the screen. <hi>On Christmas morning, at 11 a. m., this brave<lb/>
lad was stricken with yellow fever, and had a sharp attack, which<lb/>
he bore without a murmur</hi>. The period of incubation in this<lb/>
case was 3 days and 23 hours, counting from his first visit, or 2<lb/>
days and 17 1&sol;2 hours if reckoned from his last visit. <hi>The two<lb/>
&ldquo;controls&rdquo; who had</hi> slept each night in this house, only protected<lb/>
by the wire screen, but breathing the common atmosphere of the<lb/>
building, had remained in good health. They continued to so remain,<lb/>
although required to sleep <hi>here for 13 additional nights</hi>. As Moran<lb/>
had remained in strict quarantine for the period of 32 days prior to<lb/>
his attack, the source of his infection must be found within this<lb/>
house.</p>
<p>In the order of succession, the next experiment undertaken at this<lb/>
camp was the injection of blood, taken from Case V (Moran), beneath<lb/>
the skin of a Spaniard, but I will defer further mention of this line of<lb/>
experimentation until I have completed the mosquito series, as these<lb/>
are by far the most important. I, therefore, invite your attention<lb/>
<hi>to Case VI, Martinez by name</hi>. His case is of interest as bearing<lb/>
upon the number of days which must elapse after the contamination<lb/>
of the mosquito before it can convey the disease to a second indi-<lb/>
vidual.</p>
<p>An additional point of some importance, I think, is that whereas<lb/>
<hi>prior to the time of Moran's infection (Case V) the contaminated<lb/>
mosquitoes had been taken to the men in their tents and there applied,<lb/>
from this date--December 17--the subjects were invited to visit a<lb/>
particular room attached to our &ldquo;Mosquito building,&rdquo; but quite<lb/>
separate from it, where the contaminated insects were kept at sum-<lb/>
mer temperature, and were there given the opportunity of exposing</hi><lb/>
themselves to an attack of yellow fever by <hi>putting their hands inside<lb/>
of certain mosquito-inhabited jars</hi>. I may as well tell you now that<lb/>
of seven persons who <hi>availed themselves of this privilege</hi> five<lb/>
acquired yellow fever.</p>
<p>After a quarantine period, therefore, of 9 days, <hi>Martinez visited<lb/>
this room on</hi> December 17, 1900, and was bitten by 14 mosquitoes<lb/>
which 4 days before had fed upon Case I of this series. The result<lb/>
<hi>was quite negative. December 24</hi>, or on the eleventh day after<lb/>
contamination, the subject was <hi>again bitten by 7 of</hi> these insects--<lb/>
all that remained of the original 14. Again no infection took place.<lb/>
After 6 full days, or on <hi>December 30</hi>, at 11 a. m., Martinez was again<lb/>
bitten by the surviving 4 of these mosquitoes, i.e., on the seven-<lb/>
teenth day after their contamination. On the fourth day thereafter,<lb/>
January 3, 1901, at 10.30 a. m., he <hi>was seized with yellow fever</hi>,<lb/>
which ran a typical course. The period of incubation was 3 days<lb/>
22 1&sol;2 hours. Although we can not say on what particular day these<lb/>
insects became capable of conveying the disease, we are able to state<lb/>
that they were incapable of infecting on the fourth or eleventh day<lb/>
<pb n="101" id="S8220109"/>

after contamination. This experiment agrees with others that we<lb/>
have made during this investigation and in which we have failed to<lb/>
convey the disease by the bites of insects at intervals varying from<lb/>
2 to 9 days after contamination. These observations seem to indi-<lb/>
cate that after the parasite has been taken into the mosquito's stom-<lb/>
ach a certain number of days must elapse before the insect is capable<lb/>
of reconveying it to a second individual. <hi>This period probably rep-<lb/>
resents the time required for the parasite to undergo its cycle of devel-<lb/>
opment and reach the mosquito's salivary glands</hi>, and, as far as our<lb/>
experience goes, would appear to be about 12 days in summer weather<lb/>
and most probably about 18 or more days during the cooler winter<lb/>
months. <hi>Case VI, therefore, does not support the opinion of Finlay<lb/>
that the bite of the contaminated mosquito confers immunity against<lb/>
a subsequent attack of the disease, since we have seen that neither<lb/>
the bites of 14 insects on the fourth day nor the bites of 7 on the elev</hi>-<lb/>
enth day after contamination prevented in the least the conveyance<lb/>
of the infection by the bites of 4 only of these mosquitoes on the seven-<lb/>
teenth day.</p>
<p>I will now ask you to look at Case IX, as this case serves to illus-<lb/>
trate some points of interest. In the first place, this subject, an<lb/>
American, was bitten by insects that had fed upon Case I of our series<lb/>
on the third day of his illness; that is, during the secondary fever which<lb/>
followed a complete intermission in this case. Secondly, these mos-<lb/>
quitoes had been kept alive on sugar and water for a period of 39 days<lb/>
before being applied to Case IX. Of the original 5 insects that had<lb/>
bitten Case I on the third day, 4 were still alive on the thirty-ninth day<lb/>
thereafter and 3 showed every evidence of good appetite. Thirdly,<lb/>
this particular subject having passed <hi>21 nights in the &ldquo;Infected cloth</hi>-<lb/>
ing building,&rdquo; during which time he was exposed to the most intimate<lb/>
contact with fomites, without apparent detriment to his health, had<lb/>
been kept in strict quarantine for yet 30 days longer at Camp Lazear.<lb/>
<hi>At the expiration of this time, or on January 19, 1901, at</hi> 4.30 p. m., he<lb/>
visited our mosquito room, where he was bitten by these 39-day-old<lb/>
insects, 3 in number. This inoculation was followed by an attack of<lb/>
yellow fever of moderate severity, which began at 4 p. m., <hi>January<lb/>
23, the period of incubation being 3 days 23 1&sol;2 hours</hi>.</p>
<p>Case XII you will find of equal interest, as this individual was in-<lb/>
fected, in the same room, by the bites of two of these same mosquitoes<lb/>
on the fifty-first day after their contamination, the period of incuba-<lb/>
tion being 3 days 2 1&sol;2 hours and the character of the attack mild,<lb/>
while Case XIII will conclusively demonstrate that these identical<lb/>
insects, on the fifty-seventh day after their contamination, were not<lb/>
only capable of conveying the infection, but of producing an attack of<lb/>
such severity that the subject's life hung in the balance for several<lb/>
days. I regret to have to state that the <hi>individual</hi> who had con-<lb/>
sented to be bitten by these insects on the sixty-fifth day after their<lb/>
contamination <hi>failed to fulfill his promise at the last moment; so</hi><lb/>
that otherwise I can not say to what old age these mosquitoes might<lb/>
have attained. Deprived of further opportunity to feed on human<lb/>
blood, one died on the sixty-ninth day and the other on the seventy-<lb/>
first day after their original contamination. The duration of life in<lb/>
the case of these mosquitoes will readily explain how the poison of<lb/>
yellow fever can remain even in a depopulated area for a period of<lb/>
<pb n="102" id="S8220110"/>
102<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
2 1&sol;2 months; so that, as is well known, those who enter the infected<lb/>
area, even at the expiration of this period, are liable to acquire the<lb/>
disease.</p>
<p>Case XIV is that of our tenth and last successful mosquito infec-<lb/>
tion at Camp Lazear. This individual after 25 days' quarantine,<lb/>
having been bitten on February 7, 1901, at 2 p. m., by two mosqui-<lb/>
toes on the sixteenth day after their contamination, was seized with<lb/>
an attack of yellow fever at noon, <hi>February 10</hi>, after an incubation<lb/>
stage of 2 days 22 hours.</p>
<p>Thus you will observe that at this station, under strict quarantine<lb/>
precautions, we succeeded in conveying the disease to 10 nonimmunes<lb/>
by means of the bites of mosquitoes that had previously fed on cases<lb/>
of yellow fever at intervals varying from 16 to 57 days before being<lb/>
applied to the person to be infected; that the attack of yellow fever<lb/>
always followed the bite of the mosquito within the period of incuba-<lb/>
tion of this disease, and that during the period which elapsed from<lb/>
December 5, 1900, the date of our first inoculation, till February 7,<lb/>
1901, the date of our last inoculation (65 days), the order of occur-<lb/>
rence of these cases corresponds with the order of inoculation, except<lb/>
that Case II, having a longer incubation period than Case III, the<lb/>
order of their relative occurrence became reversed.</p>
<p>Table I serves to illustrate this point.</p>
<p>By an examination of this table it will be seen that of 13 individuals<lb/>
whom we attempted to infect by bites of contaminated mosquitoes<lb/>
we succeeded in 10, or 76.92 per cent. Of the three negative cases, it<lb/>
will be observed that one (<hi>Case VI</hi>), who had reacted negatively to<lb/>
the subcutaneous injection of 1.5 c. c. of blood on December 26, 1900,<lb/>
also reacted negatively to the bites of mosquitoes on January 8, 1901,<lb/>
and this notwithstanding the fact that he was bitten by the very same<lb/>
insects which nine days before had infected Case VII. We have good<lb/>
ground for the opinion, therefore, that this Spaniard may be looked<lb/>
upon as one who possessed a natural immunity to yellow fever, espe-<lb/>
cially as he was the only one of five persons who did not develop the<lb/>
disease after receiving an injection of blood taken from the general<lb/>
circulation, and was also the only one of five nonimmunes who did<lb/>
not contract yellow fever when bitten by insects which already had<lb/>
been proven capable of conveying the disease to other individuals.<lb/>
<hi>Case VIII</hi>, while negative to mosquito inoculation on December 28<lb/>
and 29, 1900, reacted positively to a blood injection (2 c. c.) on Janu-<lb/>
ary 8, 1901. This particular individual, <hi>Jernigan</hi>, entered our<lb/>
&ldquo;infected mosquito building&rdquo; on December 28 and 29, 1900, one<lb/>
week after Moran's visit, and was bitten on each occasion by one<lb/>
mosquito. As 66 per cent of the mosquitoes freed in the building on<lb/>
December 21, 1900, had already been destroyed--most probably by<lb/>
the small red ants that were present in considerable numbers--the<lb/>
subject may have been bitten by insects that were not more than 13<lb/>
days old, in which case he would hardly have become infected. While<lb/>
considering the advisability of adding other contaminated insects to<lb/>
those in the house for the purpose of infecting Jernigan, opportunity<lb/>
presented for making a blood injection, and, as he was the only avail-<lb/>
able subject in the camp at the time, it was determined to make use<lb/>
of him for this purpose.</p>
<p>Case XIII, our third negative case of mosquito inoculation, was<lb/>
bitten by 12 mosquitoes that had fed on Case VII within 8 hours of<lb/>
<pb n="103" id="S8220111"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
103<lb/>
the commencement of his attack. Although these insects were 22<lb/>
days old when applied to Case XIII, on January 25, 1901, no result<lb/>
followed the bites. As the subcutaneous injection of 2 c. c. of blood<lb/>
taken from the general circulation of Case VII, at the end of 24 hours,<lb/>
produced an attack of yellow fever in Case VIII within the period of<lb/>
incubation, it would appear to indicate that <hi>the mosquito at certain<lb/>
periods of the disease may fail to obtain the parasite owing to its<lb/>
absence, at that particular time, from the capillary circulation</hi>. This<lb/>
is not unlike what we sometimes find as the result of an examination<lb/>
of the blood of malarial fever, especially in the &aelig;stivo-autumnal type<lb/>
of the disease. Table I also shows that, in addition to the positive<lb/>
case (VIII) to which I have already invited your attention, we<lb/>
obtained three other positive results by the subcutaneous injection<lb/>
of blood taken from the general circulation on the first and second<lb/>
days of the disease, viz, Cases VIII, XI, XII. The quantity of blood<lb/>
injected in these three cases was 1.5 c. c., 0.5 c. c., and 1 c. c., respec-<lb/>
tively. The production of yellow fever in this way is of much scientific<lb/>
interest--first, as serving to confirm what the mosquito inoculations<lb/>
had already shown, viz, that the parasite is present in the general cir-<lb/>
culation; second, that passage through the body of the mosquito,<lb/>
although this would seem to be nature's method, is not absolutely<lb/>
essential in the life history of this microorganism; and third, that the<lb/>
period of incubation of the disease, when thus produced, corresponds<lb/>
fairly closely to that occasioned by the mosquito's bite. A point of<lb/>
considerable importance brought out by the blood injection was the<lb/>
absence from this blood, on careful bacteriologic culture, of any bac-<lb/>
terium which grows on our ordinary media by aerobic methods, thus<lb/>
excluding absolutely the <hi rend="italic">bacillus icteroides</hi> of Sanarelli from further<lb/>
claim as the specific agent of yellow fever.</p>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
105</p>
<p>You will recall that we undertook at Camp Lazear still a third<lb/>
method of propagating this disease, viz, by fomites. I must now tell<lb/>
you that during the whole time that we were producing cases of<lb/>
yellow fever by the bite of the mosquito and by blood injection, we<lb/>
were leaving no stone unturned in order to produce the disease by<lb/>
contact with fomites. Sleeping every night in the &ldquo;Infected cloth-<lb/>
ing building,&rdquo; <hi>to which no sunlight ever came</hi>, and in which the<lb/>
<hi>circulation of air was purposely made as defective as possible</hi>; en-<lb/>
gaged in the morning in packing boxes with garments much soiled<lb/>
by contact with the bodies and excreta of yellow-fever patients, and<lb/>
at night unpacking these same boxes in order to obtain articles for<lb/>
their beds and clothing for their bodies--in <hi>other words, sleeping in<lb/>
the very beds and garments just vacated by cases of yellow fever</hi>,<lb/>
seven nonimmune young Americans, <hi>averaging each 21 nights</hi> amid<lb/>
such uninviting surroundings, came out of this pesthouse, so to speak,<lb/>
at the expiration of their term none the worse for their experience.<lb/>
Not one had contracted the disease.</p>
<p>In the light of these results we can hardly be expected hereafter to<lb/>
lend much credence to such observations as that given by Harvey<lb/>
Brown, in 1872,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> as narrated by Dr. A. A. Baldwin, of Jacksonville,<lb/>
Fla., presumbly from memory, some 13 years after the event. In<lb/>
this instance two children in Jacksonville, Fla., &ldquo;contracted the<lb/>
disease by being present at the opening of a trunk belonging to their<lb/>
uncle who, a few days before leaving Habana, had visited the yellow-<lb/>
fever hospital, where he passed by the beds of those who were throw-<lb/>
ing up black vomit; and this, notwithstanding the fact that his coat,<lb/>
the only woolen clothing he had on at the time, had been sponged<lb/>
with alcohol after his return from the hospital!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or this, recorded by Rochester,<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> as an example &ldquo; of the wonderful<lb/>
tenacity with which fomites hold the pestiferous material&rdquo; and after-<lb/>
wards &ldquo;convey it to mankind with intense effect.&rdquo; &ldquo;In September,<lb/>
1856, an infected ship from Cuba was detained at the quarantine<lb/>
anchorage off Staten Island, N. Y. Several passengers died, and<lb/>
some were ill on board. The garments and bedding were thrown<lb/>
overboard. Bay Ridge, a delightful suburban neighborhood of<lb/>
Brooklyn, lies directly across the bay, distant about 1 mile from the<lb/>
anchorage mentioned. The wind and tide deposited a number of<lb/>
garments that had been thrown away on the beach which terminated<lb/>
the lawn of Col. Charles Prince, an old and respected resident. In<lb/>
taking his usual morning walk he discovered the clothing and ex-<lb/>
amined it with his cane, not otherwise handling it. He had no sus-<lb/>
picion that it came from quarantine and never saw it again. In four<lb/>
days he was taken ill and died in a week of yellow fever.&rdquo; We lose<lb/>
our faith in this brine-soaked bedding when we find, according to<lb/>
Elisha Harris's report,<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> that on the Long Island shore, directly oppo-<lb/>
site the quarantine grounds (Bay Ridge) 6 cases of yellow fever and 3<lb/>
deaths from black vomit had already occurred between the 13th and<lb/>
21st of July, 1856, and that &ldquo;from the latter date the malady ex-<lb/>
tended fearfully until it had visited nearly every dwelling on the<lb/>
shore of that beautiful Bay Ridge, 30 cases and 15 deaths having<lb/>
occurred in that district previous to August 1.&rdquo;</p>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>I could quote many other instances contained in the literature, but<lb/>
as <hi>not one of them, as far as my search</hi> has gone, <hi>will bear the slightest<lb/>
intelligent criticism</hi>, I will not further trespass on your time except to<lb/>
say that, in my opinion, every epidemic of yellow fever that has occurred<lb/>
in the United States, both prior to and since the period when disinfec-<lb/>
tants were used, has pointed in the plainest manner to the innocence of<lb/>
fomites as a means of propagation of this disease; for with the onset of<lb/>
cold weather and under those conditions of lessened ventilation of dwell-<lb/>
ings and artificial heat that should have aided in the spread of the<lb/>
epidemic, just the contrary effect has always resulted. Under the cir-<lb/>
cumstances one must either conclude that an external temperature<lb/>
of 32&deg; F. is quite sufficient to bring about, and that speedily, the<lb/>
thorough disinfection of the many tons of infected clothing and bed-<lb/>
ding contained in the houses of a large city at the end of an epidemic<lb/>
of yellow fever or that fomites have no part in the propagation of the<lb/>
disease. The latter conclusion, it seems to me, is the only intelligible<lb/>
one, in view of our present knowledge of the disinfectant action of<lb/>
cold on bacteria.</p>
<p>Let us now see if there are any facts observed by others in connec-<lb/>
tion with the ordinary propagation of yellow fever which support<lb/>
those recorded by us as the result of mosquito bites at Camp Lazear.<lb/>
<hi>Since in our limited experience, affecting 23 individuals</hi>, we have not<lb/>
<hi>observed the production of the disease by the bite of the mosquito<lb/>
within less than 12 days after contamination, we would expect that,<lb/>
when a case of yellow fever was imported</hi> into a town or house where<lb/>
the conditions were favorable for its propagation, a secondary case<lb/>
would not occur within a less period of time than about 14 or more<lb/>
days. I may say that various observers have noted that after the<lb/>
occurrence of the first case in a town, a considerable interval elapses<lb/>
(2 or 3 weeks) prior to the appearance of other cases. Although such<lb/>
general statements are of value, what we need are exact observa-<lb/>
tions recorded under such conditions that the secondary cases can be<lb/>
positively referred to a certain limited source of infection. This, of<lb/>
course, can best be done where the disease has been imported into<lb/>
small settlements or into isolated houses, and it was under just such<lb/>
favorable circumstances that Carter, of the Marine Hospital Service,<lb/>
made his observations at Orwood and Taylor, Miss., in 1898, &ldquo;on the<lb/>
interval between the infecting and secondary cases of yellow fever.&rdquo;<lb/>
Here, in a community of more than average intelligence, consisting<lb/>
&ldquo;not of a town, or even a hamlet, but only of a neighborhood,&rdquo; as<lb/>
Carter puts it, it was possible to record with accuracy the date of<lb/>
introduction of the infecting cases and the date of occurrence of<lb/>
secondary cases.</p>
<p>Table II gives the results of this investigation.</p>
<p>This table shows that of 16 houses in which the interval between<lb/>
the infecting case and the first secondary case was recorded, 15, or<lb/>
93.7 per cent, correspond with the mosquito interval; that is, the<lb/>
secondary cases occur at just the interval--13 to 23 days--when we<lb/>
would expect them to develop, provided the mosquito was concerned<lb/>
in the propagation of the disease. It will be observed that in only 1<lb/>
of the 16 first secondary cases was the interval as short as 11 days<lb/>
and 15 hours. If the commencement of the attack in this case has<lb/>
been recorded correctly, it would indicate that the number of days<lb/>
<pb n="107" id="S8220115"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
107<lb/>
which we have given as &ldquo;<hi>about 12</hi>&rdquo; for the development of the para-<lb/>
site within the mosquito would have to be shortened somewhat--<lb/>
<hi>probably to 10 days</hi>. In our first successful experimental case, where<lb/>
the disease was produced by the bite of the mosquito on the twelfth<lb/>
day after the insect's contamination, we could not say, of course, that<lb/>
this particular mosquito would not have conveyed the infection had<lb/>
it been allowed to bite on the tenth or eleventh day after contamina-<lb/>
tion.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we take all the secondary cases that occurred<lb/>
in these 16 houses, we will find that of a total of 71 cases, only 1<lb/>
developed the disease after so short an interval as 11 days and 15<lb/>
hours; in other words, 70, or 98.5 per cent, of the secondary cases<lb/>
occurred after an interval of 13 days. As a matter of fact only 2 of<lb/>
these secondary cases occurred within a less period than 14 days, 1<lb/>
developing on the twelfth and the other on the thirteenth day.</p>

<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> 11 days 15 hours.</p>
<p>I do not know what conclusion you may draw from the data con-<lb/>
tained in Table II, but to my mind they are strongly suggestive that<lb/>
the same mode of propagation which we were making use of at Camp<lb/>
Lazear during the past winter was at work in the epidemic of yellow<lb/>
fever at Orwood and Taylor, Miss., during the summer of 1898.</p>
<p>From my own personal experience, I can only add one observation<lb/>
to those given by Carter, viz, at <hi>Quemados, Cuba, where of two<lb/>
nurses who remained continuously in attendance upon a case of yellow<lb/>
fever, one contracted the disease on the fourteenth day and the other<lb/>
on the fifteenth day after the commencement of the primary case</hi>.</p>
<p>While the temptation is great to extract from the literature other<lb/>
observations confirmatory of those given (and they are numerous), I<lb/>
must refrain from doing this, since I promised to confine myself largely<lb/>
to my own experience in regard to the propagation of yellow fever.<lb/>
For this reason and because I feel that I have already trespassed<lb/>
on your patience longer than I had any right to do, I must omit any<lb/>
reference to the habits of <hi rend="italic">culex fasciatus</hi>, or of the thermal influences<lb/>
concerned in the propagation of this mosquito, both of which are of<lb/>
much importance in connection with the subject under consideration.<lb/>
<pb n="108" id="S8220116"/>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
I trust that I have said enough, however, to indicate to you that, in<lb/>
my opinion, the ideas which we have heretofore held concerning the<lb/>
propagation of yellow fever must undergo considerable recasting.<lb/>
I do not believe that we can longer ascribe with confidence any part<lb/>
of the spread of this disease to fomites, for under such conditions of<lb/>
intimate and long-continued exposure as could never occur in the<lb/>
natural course of every-day life we have looked in vain for its<lb/>
development.</p>
<p>While in matters pertaining to the public health, cleanliness should<lb/>
always stand next to godliness, I do not think that we will be justified<lb/>
in assigning so much importance hereafter to those insanitary condi-<lb/>
tions of soil which, being due especially to pollution with animal<lb/>
matter, were supposed, in some mysterious way, to aid in the spread<lb/>
of this disease. Strange as it may sound, I do not believe that the<lb/>
enforcement of the most rigid hygienic regulations, such as we have<lb/>
heretofore known them, will prevent the propagation of this grave<lb/>
epidemic disease, provided it should again be imported into this coun-<lb/>
try. I seriously doubt if we can longer class yellow fever with the<lb/>
&ldquo;filth diseases.&rdquo; The apparent results obtained by the improved<lb/>
sanitary arrangements instituted by <hi>Gen. Bulter in the city</hi> of New<lb/>
<hi>Orleans, during the year 1862</hi>, and carried on by his military suc-<lb/>
cessors, probably served to strengthen, as much as anything else, the<lb/>
view held by the profession that filth was, if not essential, yet of<lb/>
extreme importance, in aiding the spread of yellow fever. I dare<lb/>
say that but few stopped to consider that Gen. Butler found the city<lb/>
of New Orleans already quite free of yellow fever, and that the same<lb/>
system of blockade which kept this disease out of the former city,<lb/>
under improved sanitary conditions, kept it out of other Southern<lb/>
seaports during the same period, although their sanitary conditions<lb/>
remained unchanged. If one is inclined to believe that improved<lb/>
hygienic conditions, as usually understood, will arrest the spread of<lb/>
yellow fever, let him turn to the city of Habana under American sani-<lb/>
tary administration. Probably in no city in the world have such<lb/>
unremitting sanitary efforts been put forth as in the city of Habana<lb/>
since our occupation in January, 1899. <hi>We were told that the hard<lb/>
work of Gen. Ludlow and his assistants was responsible for the marked<lb/>
decrease of cases of yellow fever during the first seven months of 1899--</hi><lb/>
and appearances seem to indicate as much--nevertheless, with the<lb/>
commencement of Spanish immigration, during August of that year,<lb/>
and the introduction of susceptible material, cases of yellow fever<lb/>
began to rapidly multiply, so that the city had a late summer and fall<lb/>
epidemic of this disease. Concerning the occurrence of yellow fever<lb/>
in that city during the past year, Maj. Harvard, chief surgeon, Depart-<lb/>
ment of Cuba, in a recent report, after describing the thorough work<lb/>
which had been done by the sanitary authorities and its marked effect<lb/>
upon the reduction in deaths, especially from tuberculosis, goes on to<lb/>
say:</p>
<p>It is certain that in Habana, in 1900, no visible correlation could be seen between dirt<lb/>
and yellow fever; the district which became first strongly infected lies east and south<lb/>
of the Parque Central, and is one of the cleanest and best constructed, while the most<lb/>
insanitary wards became infected late in the season and only to a slight extent; the<lb/>
malodorous district reserved to houses of ill-fame hardly had a case. Yellow fever has<lb/>
not followed the poor and unclean, nor the mark of previous infection, but rather the<lb/>
movement of nonimmunes; wherever these located, there the infection searched and<lb/>
found them, regardless of the hygienic conditions of their premises.</p>
<pb n="109" id="S8220117"/>
<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
109</p>
<p>What is the sanitary story, then, for the year 1900? Simply that<lb/>
with the return of summer weather and the continued influx of new<lb/>
material, and in spite of unremitting efforts to keep the city clean,<lb/>
Habana <hi>has experienced a more serious epidemic of yellow fever,<lb/>
affecting its civilian population, than it has had during the preceding<lb/>
20 years</hi>. Need we now express surprise at such a result? Have we<lb/>
not seen at <hi>Camp Lazear, under the very best hygienic surroundings</hi>,<lb/>
six individuals attacked with yellow fever, <hi>after a few short visits to a<lb/>
new building whose foundation stood on the unbroken turf and whose<lb/>
rooms were filled with sunshine and with an atmosphere just swept<lb/>
in from the ocean, at the very moment of infection</hi>? Where then,<lb/>
gentlemen, shall we look for the agent that is vitally concerned in the<lb/>
propagation of yellow fever? In the light of these newer observations<lb/>
which I have had the pleasure of presenting to you, I believe that we<lb/>
may affirm, with <hi>some degree of confidence</hi>, that here, substituting<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">culex</hi> for <hi rend="italic">anopheles</hi>, we have to deal with the same source of infection<lb/>
to which we now trace the malarial fevers--the mosquito.</p>

<head>EXPERIMENTAL YELLOW FEVER.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></head>
<byline>By <docAuthor>WALTER REED</docAuthor>, M. D., Surgeon, United States Army., JAMES CARROLL, M. D.,<lb/>
and A. AGRAMONTE, M. D., Contract Surgeons, United States Army.</byline>
<p>Subsequent to the presentation of our paper to the Pan-American<lb/>
Congress<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> in Habana, we succeeded in producing some additional<lb/>
cases of yellow fever at our experimental sanitary station near Que-<lb/>
mados, Cuba. We have thought that brief reports of these cases, to<lb/>
be followed by remarks on experimental yellow fever from the clinical<lb/>
point of view, would be of interest to the members of this association,<lb/>
and especially to those who reside in sections of the country where<lb/>
each year yellow fever is liable to appear in epidemic form.</p>
<p>Perhaps it might be well to recall the fact that the cases of yellow<lb/>
fever here to be recorded were produced like those heretofore reported<lb/>
by us, under strict quarantine regulations and at a special experi-<lb/>
mental sanitary station, near the town of Quemados, Cuba.</p>
<p>In a series of 12 experimental cases produced at this camp during<lb/>
the period from December 5, 1900, to February 7, 1901--an interval<lb/>
of 65 days--it should be borne in mind that the order of occurrence<lb/>
exactly correspond with the order of inoculation,except that Case II,<lb/>
inoculated at 4 p. m., December 8, 1900--having a longer period of<lb/>
incubation than Case III, inoculated at 10.30 a. m.,December 9,<lb/>
1900--the order of their relative occurrence became reversed<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>.<lb/>
Moreover the attack always followed within the period of incubation<lb/>
of the disease, and concerned only those nonimmune individuals who<lb/>
had consented to submit themselves for experimentation. <hi>Of a total<lb/>
of 16 individuals who thus consented, 14 contracted yellow fever;<lb/>
whereas of 5 nonimmunes, who did not consent and were therefore<lb/>
not subjected to experimentation, none acquired the disease, although</hi><lb/>
otherwise placed under exactly similar surroundings. In its occur-<lb/>
rence, therefore, at this station, yellow fever strictly obeyed the<lb/>
behests of the experimenters, both as to place and time of occurrence.<lb/>
Recovery took place in all cases.</p>
<p>(A) CASES PRODUCED BY THE INJECTION OF BLOOD.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case I</hi>.--W. J., American, nonimmune, aged 27--in quarantine since December<lb/>

neously with 2 c. c. of blood taken from the general circulation of a case of mild yellow<lb/>
fever at the beginning of the second day of the disease and having a temperature of<lb/>
100.8&deg; F. The subject, who had been in strict quarantine at the station for the period<lb/>
of 45 days, remained in his usual health until the early morning of January 8, when<lb/>
he complained of slight frontal headaches. At 6 a. m. his temperature was 98.2&deg; F.,<lb/>

<p>slight chilly sensations in the feet and lower extremities. There were some con-<lb/>
gestion of the eyes and his usual florid complexion was heightened in color. At<lb/>
10.15 a. m., temperature 100.6&deg; F., pulse 97. Complains of some pain in the lumbar<lb/>
region. At 11.20 a. m., temperature 101.4&deg; F., pulse 99. The height of the febrile<lb/>
paroxysm was reached at 3 p. m. the same day, when the temperature was 103.4&deg; F.<lb/>
and pulse 108. The facial expression was now characteristic of yellow fever. The<lb/>
eyes were deeply injected and watery and the face much suffused. Photophobia<lb/>
moderate--frontal headache and backache severe. The skin was moist. The<lb/>
remission occurred at the end of 24 hours--9 a. m. January 9--when the temperature<lb/>
had fallen to 99.4&deg; F. and the pulse to 86. The subsequent history was that of a case<lb/>
of yellow fever of moderate severity. Albumin was found in the urine at the end<lb/>
of the sixty-first hour. There was some bleeding from the gums on the third day<lb/>
and moderate ocular jaundice on the fourth day. Fever disappeared on the morning<lb/>
of the seventh day. (Chart I.)</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case II</hi>.--W. O., American, nonimmune, aged 28, in quarantine since December<lb/>
20, 1900. On January 8, 1901, at 9 p. m., with his full consent, he was given by sub-<lb/>
cutaneous injection 1.5 c. c. of blood taken from the mediancephalic vein of Case I,<lb/>
just 12 hours after the beginning of the attack and when the temperature was 102.4&deg; F.,<lb/>
that is, just after the first febrile paroxysm began to decline. The subject remained<lb/>
in his usual condition during the following two days.</p>
<p>January 11, 1901, at 6 a. m. his temperature was 98.9&deg; F. and pulse 70. He com-<lb/>
plained of being disturbed by dreams during the night and had some frontal headache.<lb/>
At 9 a. m. temperature 100&deg; F., pulse 77. At 10.15 a. m. temperature 101.4&deg; F., pulse<lb/>
76. Eyes decidedly congested and face moderately suffused. At 12 o'clock noon,<lb/>
when the temperature had risen to 103.2&deg; F. and the pulse to 102, the height of the<lb/>
primary paroxysm had been reached. Headache and backache were now much<lb/>
complained of. The facial expression was characteristic. The remission occurred<lb/>
at the end of 24 hours, lasted one day, and was followed by a very moderate secondary<lb/>
fever. A distinct trace of albumin was found in the urine passed at 2 a. m. January<lb/>
12, 17 hours after the attack began. A few hyaline casts were also present. Slight<lb/>
bleeding from the gums occurred on the second and third days of sickness. The<lb/>
character of the attack in this case was very mild. The albumin, which at no time<lb/>
amounted to more than a distinct trace, did not disappear, however, until January<lb/>
24. (Chart II.)</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case III</hi>.--W. F., American, nonimmune, aged 23, was, with his full consent, at 1<lb/>
p. m. o'clock January 22, 1901, injected subcutaneously with 0.5 c. c. of blood taken<lb/>
on the second day from the general circulation of a severe case of yellow fever, which<lb/>
was fatal on the seventh day of the disease. The patient's temperature, when the<lb/>
blood was withdrawn, was 103&deg; F. and pulse 90. The subject remained well during<lb/>
the following day. January 24, at 6 a. m., his temperature was 98.4&deg; F., and pulse<lb/>
78. He partook of a hearty breakfast at 6.30 a. m., which he vomited soon afterwards.<lb/>
At 7 a. m. he complained of dizziness and general lassitude. Temperature, 98.4&deg;,<lb/>
pulse 78. At 9 a. m.,chilliness complained of, but there is no record of temperature<lb/>
or pulse. At 9.30 a. m., temperature 100.6&deg; F., pulse 82. Frontal headache well<lb/>
marked. Eyes already injected and face slightly suffused. At 10.30 a. m., tempera-<lb/>
ture 101.2&deg; F. and pulse 86. An hour later his temperature was 102.6&deg; F. and pulse<lb/>
82. The height of the primary paroxysm was reached at 1 p. m. when the tempera-<lb/>
ture was 102.8&deg; F. and pulse 98. At this hour photophobia was well marked and<lb/>
constant complaint made of severe frontal headache and backache, together with<lb/>
pains in the lower extremities. The skin was moist. The remission occurred at the<lb/>
end of 36 hours. The subsequent course was that of a case of yellow fever of moderate<lb/>
severity. With the return of the secondary fever there were present sharp backache<lb/>
and headache. Albumin appeared in the urine at the end of 57 1&sol;2 hours. Ocular<lb/>
jaundice was present on the third day and thereafter until convalescence. The gums<lb/>
did not bleed, although they were swollen and injected. Fever subsided on the sixth<lb/>
day, and albumin disappeared on the eighth day. (Chart III.)</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case IV</hi>.--J. H. A., American, nonimmune, aged 22, with his full consent, received<lb/>
subcutaneously, at 12.15 p. m.,<hi>January 25, 1901</hi>, 1 cc. of blood taken from the median-<lb/>
cephalic vein of Case III, just 27 1&sol;4 hours after the commencement of the latter's attack<lb/>
of yellow fever (T. 100.6&deg; F.). The subject remained in his usual condition during<lb/>
January 26 and 27, except that on the afternoon of the last-mentioned date he com-<lb/>
plained of occipital headache. This was present on the following morning, January<lb/>
28; otherwise he felt well. His temperature at noon was 98.6&deg; F., and pulse 68.<lb/>
Occipital headache continued. He partook of dinner with fair appetite. He was not<lb/>
seen again until 3 p. m. In the meanwhile, at 1.15 p. m., the subject states that,<lb/>
while sitting alone in his tent, he began to feel cold, and that this was quickly fol-<lb/>
lowed by a decided chill with increase of headache. He noted the hour in writing at<lb/>

<p>the time. At 3 p. m. his temperature was 103.6&deg; and pulse 120. The eyes were<lb/>
intensely congested and the face deeply suffused. The patient was very restless,and<lb/>
complained bitterly of occipital headache and backache. Photophobia was very<lb/>
marked. He vomited several times within the next 2 hours. Skin hot and dry.<lb/>
The height of the primary paroxysm was reached at 3.30 p. m., at which hour the<lb/>
temperature was 104.2&deg; F., and pulse 120. The subsequent history was one of <hi>severe<lb/>
yellow fever</hi>. There was no remission in the fever until the fourth day, when the<lb/>
temperature fell to 101.2&deg; F. Now, for the first time, the patient ceased to complain<lb/>
of occipital headache and backache. Albumin appeared at the end of 18 1&sol;4 hours<lb/>
(7.30 a. m., January 29). A few hyaline casts were also present at this time. The<lb/>
specimen of urine passed at 6.40 a. m., January 30, contained albumin one-twentieth<lb/>
by volume, and many fine and coarse, granular, bile-tinted casts. Ocular jaundice<lb/>
appeared on the third day. The skin of the face and of the anterior part of the neck<lb/>
and thorax was tinted on the fourth day. This rapidly became intensified and general.<lb/>
The secondary fever lasted about 30 hours, the temperature falling to 97.2&deg; F. at 12<lb/>
o'clock (midnight) of the fifth day. Marked fluctuations of temperature continued<lb/>
until the eleventh day of illness. Recovery was slow and much delayed by the<lb/>
development of a <hi>carbuncle in the left sacral region</hi>. A trace of albumin was still<lb/>
present on March 1, 32 days after the attack had begun. (Chart IV.)</p>
<p>The production of yellow fever by the injection of blood taken<lb/>
from the general circulation is of much interest as showing, first,<lb/>
that the parasite is present in the blood, at least during the early<lb/>
stages of the disease, and secondly, that its passage through an inter-<lb/>
mediate host, although this would seem to be nature's method, is not<lb/>
essential in the life cycle of this parasite. Thus yellow fever is<lb/>
analogous to the malarial fevers, in that it may be produced either<lb/>
by the bite of a certain species of mosquito, or by the injection of<lb/>
blood taken directly from the general circulation.</p>
<p>Another point to which we have elsewhere referred, but which is<lb/>
considered of sufficient importance to bear repetition here, is that in<lb/>
each of the foregoing cases of experimental yellow fever produced by<lb/>
the injection of blood, careful cultures made from the same blood<lb/>
drawn from the vein immediately after injection or, as in one instance,<lb/>
made from the same syringeful of blood that conveyed the disease,<lb/>
failed to show the presence of Sanarelli's bacillus. In one case colo-<lb/>
nies of <hi rend="italic">Staphylococcus pyogenes citreus</hi> were obtained, while in the<lb/>
remaining three cases no growth whatever occurred. The exclusion<lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> from further consideration as the specific agent of<lb/>
yellow fever would, therefore, seem to have been conclusively deter-<lb/>
mined by these experiments.</p>
<p>(B) CASES PRODUCED BY THE BITE OF THE MOSQUITO, CULEX FASCIATUS.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case V</hi>.--L. F., American, nonimmune, aged 28--in quarantine since December 20,<lb/>
1900--was, with his full consent, at 3.30 p. m., January 19, 1901, bitten by three mos-<lb/>
quitoes that had been contaminated 39 days previously, by feeding on the blood of a<lb/>
well-marked case of yellow fever, on the third day of the disease. The subject<lb/>
remained in his usual condition of health until the afternoon of January 23. At noon of<lb/>
this date his temperature was 97.8&deg;. Soon after this hour he took to his bed, com-<lb/>
plaining of frontal headache and general lassitude. At 3 p. m. his temperature was<lb/>
99.2&deg; and pulse 78. At 4.10 p. m. the temperature was 100&deg; F. and pulse 104. A<lb/>
sense of chilliness, especially of the lower extremities, and increased frontal headache,<lb/>
were now complained of. Eyes already injected and face flushed. At 5 p. m. the<lb/>
temperature was 101.2&deg; F. and pulse 104. The height of the paroxysm was reached at<lb/>
8.20 p. m., at which hour the temperature was 103.6&deg; F. and the pulse 110. The eyes<lb/>
were deeply congested and photophobia very marked. Headache and backache were<lb/>
so intense as to cause the patient to complain bitterly. He vomited once at 9 p. m.<lb/>
January 24, 3 a. m., the temperature had fallen to 100.2&deg; and the pulse to 104, but with<lb/>
only slight amelioration to the patient's discomforts. At noon the thermometer<lb/>
marked 102&deg;. Remission occurred at the end of 33 hours, with marked diminution of all<lb/>
disagreeable symptoms. The secondary fever, attended by increased headache and</p>

<p>backache, lasted four days, the temperature dropping to normal at 6 p. m. of the<lb/>
seventh day. The case was one of moderate severity. Albumin appeared in the<lb/>
urine at the end of the forty-second hour. Ocular jaundice was quite noticeable on<lb/>
the afternoon of the second day. Some jaundice of the face and anterior region of the<lb/>
chest was seen on the fourth day. Many bile-tinted granular casts were present in the<lb/>
urine on the third day, and thereafter until the eleventh day. The albumin which<lb/>
reached one-fifteenth by volume on the sixth day disappeared on the twelfth day.<lb/>
(Chart V.)</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case VI</hi>.--C. W., American, nonimmune, aged 27, with his full consent, was at<lb/>
9.30 a. m., January 31, bitten by 2 of the 3 mosquitoes that had been applied to the<lb/>
foregoing Case V. The interval that had elapsed since their contamination was,<lb/>
therefore, 51 days. The subject remained well until 12 o'clock noon, February 3,<lb/>
when he complained of heaviness in his legs and some supraorbital pain. His tem-<lb/>
terature at this hour was 99&deg; F. and pulse 70. At 1.30 p. m. it had risen to 100&deg; F.,<lb/>
and at 5 p. m. to 100.&deg; F. and pulse to 84. The primary rise of fever, which was some-<lb/>
what fluctuating in character, did not reach its height until at the end of 24 hours,<lb/>
noon, February 1, when the temperature was 102.4&deg; and the pulse 92. The facies<lb/>
was now suggestive of yellow fever. Remission occurred at the end of 45 hours and<lb/>
lasted for about 1 day. The secondary rise was slight in character, the temperature<lb/>
falling to normal on the morning of the sixth day. The case was very mild in char-<lb/>
acter. Albumin appeared at the end of 75 hours (beginning of fourth day); it never<lb/>
amounted to more than a distinct trace and disappeared on the eighth day. There<lb/>
was no ocular jaundice, and although the gums were injected and swollen, there was<lb/>
no hemorrhage at any time. The patient perspired freely throughout the attack.<lb/>
Convalescence was rapid. The subject had been in quarantine for the period of 6<lb/>
days prior to inoculation. (Chart VI.)</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case VII</hi>.--J. H., American, nonimmune, aged 26, with his full consent, was bitten<lb/>
at 11 a. m., February 6, 1901, by the same 2 mosquitoes that had 6 days previously<lb/>
bitten Case VI. Fifty-seven days had therefore elapsed since the insects had been<lb/>
contaminated by biting a case of yellow fever. He remained well until 12 o'clock<lb/>
noon, February 9, when he experienced slight chilly sensations, accompanied by<lb/>
yawning. At this hour his temperature was 99&deg; F. and pulse 72. At 3 p. m., tem-<lb/>
perature 98.8&deg;, pulse 72. Says that he feels &ldquo;out of sorts,&rdquo; but has no headache. At<lb/>
5.30 p. m. his temperature was 100.6&deg; F., pulse 78. He was not seen until 7.30 p. m.,<lb/>
when he complained of backache and severe general headache, more intense through<lb/>
the frontal region. Eyes much injected, photophobia very marked, face flushed.<lb/>
He was stretching and yawning constantly, complained of nausea, and vomited a<lb/>
small quantity of partially digested food. The height of the primary fever was reached<lb/>
at 3 p. m. February 10, i. e., 22 hours after the commencement of the attack, when<lb/>
the temperature was 102.8&deg; and the pulse 98. Remission of the fever to 99.4&deg; and<lb/>
pulse to 74 occurred at 6 a. m., February 11, making the duration of the primary<lb/>
paroxysm 36 hours. Twenty-four hours after the remission had occurred the tem-<lb/>
perature had risen to 102.4&deg; with a pulse of 70. The fever continued to steadily<lb/>
increase until midnight of February 12, when a temperature of 105&deg; F. was recorded,<lb/>
with a pulse of 90. The subsequent course was that of a case of severe yellow fever.<lb/>
Slight oozing of blood from the gums occurred as early as the third day. Ocular<lb/>
jaundice, beginning on the third day, became later very distinct and was associated<lb/>
with general jaundice. Albumin, however, did not appear until the sixth day. The<lb/>
fever subsided on the ninth day, and was followed by a slow convalescence. The<lb/>
subject had been in strict quarantine for a period of 78 days prior to inoculation.<lb/>
(Chart VII.)</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case VIII</hi>.--C. S., American, nonimmune, aged 28, with his full consent, was<lb/>
bitten at 2 p. m., February 7, 1901, by 3 mosquitoes that had been contaminated<lb/>
16 days previously by biting a fatal case of yellow fever on the second day of the<lb/>
disease. The subject remained well until the early afternoon of the third day,Feb-<lb/>
ruary 10. He ate his dinner at noon with good appetite. At 1 p. m., his temperature<lb/>
was 100&deg; F., pulse, 90. Frontal headache was now complained of. This became<lb/>
rapidly more marked, and pains in the limbs were also present. Three hours later,<lb/>
4 p. m., the fever had risen only one-fifth of a degree, but at 6 p. m. it had reached<lb/>
103&deg; F. and pulse, 96. At this hour he had severe headache and backache, with<lb/>
general pains over the body. The facial expression was now characteristic. Eyes<lb/>
brightly injected, photophobia well marked, and face decidedly congested. At 9<lb/>
p. m. temperature was 103.2&deg; and pulse 112. The skin was moist. Remission occurred<lb/>
at 6 a. m., February 12, 41 hours after the commencement of the febrile paroxysm.<lb/>
The secondary fever, which was moderate in character, lasted 4 days, the fever sub-<lb/>
siding on the seventh day. Ocular jaundice was slight. A few hyaline casts were<lb/>
present on the third and subsequent days, but no albumin was found until 1 p. m.,</p>

<p>February 18, that is, 36 hours after the fever had subsided. It was present at a dis-<lb/>
tinct trace in all specimens examined until 3 p. m., February 23. Convalescence was<lb/>
rapid. The subject had been in quarantine for a period of 25 days prior to inocula-<lb/>
tion. (Chart VIII.)</p>
<p>The foregoing cases of experimental yellow fever (Cases V, VI, and<lb/>
VII) are, we think, of especial importance as showing the length of time<lb/>
during which the mosquito may remain capable of conveying the infec-<lb/>
tion. In previous papers we have reported 6 cases of yellow fever pro-<lb/>
duced by the bites of mosquitoes at intervals varying from 12 to 24 days<lb/>
after the contamination of the insects. In the cases here reported<lb/>
the periods intervening between the contamination of the insect and<lb/>
the production of the disease were much longer, viz, 39, 51, and 57<lb/>
days, respectively. <hi>As one of these insects lived until the sixty-ninth<lb/>
and another until the seventy-first day after contamination, we have<lb/>
for the first time an explanation of the fact, several times noted in<lb/>
the literature, that the contagion of yellow fever may cling for several<lb/>
months to a building that has been vacated by its occupants, or to<lb/>
the infected area of a town, even though this latter has been entirely<lb/>
depopulated</hi>. These particular insects also were contaminated at a<lb/>
later stage of the disease than in any of our other cases, i. e., on the third<lb/>
day and during the secondary rise of the fever, following a complete<lb/>
intermission in the temperature. We have, therefore, been able to<lb/>
demonstrate that <hi>the parasite is present in the general circulation<lb/>
both after and before the stage of remission</hi>. How much later in the<lb/>
disease the parasite may still be found--a matter of much interest<lb/>
and importance--the observations thus far made do not determine.<lb/>
Although the 3 mosquitoes applied on the third day, as above stated,<lb/>
acquired the parasites and were able to affect 3 individuals with yellow<lb/>
fever, a single mosquito applied to the same case of yellow fever on<lb/>
the fourth day of the disease failed to obtain the parasite, as shown<lb/>
by the negative result following its bite 40 days after contamination.<lb/>
That not all mosquitoes become infected, however, with the parasite<lb/>
by biting yellow fever patients is shown by several observations made<lb/>
by us. We submit only one.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case IX</hi>.--<del>J</del><add>E</add>. W., American, nonimmune, was, with his full consent, on January<lb/>
<hi>25</hi>, 1901, bitten by 12 mosquitoes (<hi rend="italic">C. fasciatus</hi>) that had fed on a case of mild yellow<lb/>
fever--in a man named Martinez--on January 3, 1901, within 8 hours of the com-<lb/>
mencement of the attack. Although these mosquitoes had been kept at a summer<lb/>
temperature for 22 days, the result of the experiment was <hi>entirely negative</hi>. That<lb/>
the parasites were present in Martinez's blood at the end of 24 hours was fully shown<lb/>
by the effect produced by injecting 2 c. c. of his blood drawn at this time beneath the<lb/>
skin of Case I of this report.</p>
<p>Observations such as the foregoing would indicate that the mos-<lb/>
quito at certain periods of the disease may fail to obtain the parasite,<lb/>
owing to its absence at that particular time from the capillary circu-<lb/>
lation. <hi>Concerning the matter of the propagation of yellow fever<lb/>
by other species of culex than <hi rend="italic">C. fasciatus</hi>, we have only 1 negative<lb/>
observation to record of an individual bitten by 5 <hi rend="italic">C. pungens</hi> that</hi><lb/>
had been contaminated by biting a case of yellow fever 19 days pre-<lb/>
viously. To a single negative experiment such as this no importance<lb/>
can be given, so that this question must be left for future observa-<lb/>
tions to determine.</p>
<p>Touching the subject of the possible transmission of the parasite<lb/>
to the daughter insect by means of infection of the ovum, we have<lb/>
also but a <hi>single</hi> observation to record. In this case the bites of 14</p>

<p>mosquitoes, hatched from the ova of a mosquito (<hi rend="italic">C. fasciatus</hi>) that had<lb/>

by an entirely negative result.</p>
<p>Including the cases heretofore reported by us, we have thus far<lb/>
succeeded in <hi>conveying yellow fever to 12 individuals by means of<lb/>
the bites of contaminated mosquitoes, and to 4 other persons by sub-</hi><lb/>
cutaneous injection of blood taken from cases of this disease--a<lb/>
total of 16 cases. While ordinarily so small a number of cases would<lb/>
not be sufficient to enable one to arrive at definite conclusions con-<lb/>
cerning the general character and course of an acute infectious<lb/>
disease, the conditions under which the majority of these cases were<lb/>
observed were such as to give us valuable data concerning two<lb/>
matters of very great practical importance in connection with this<lb/>
disease, viz, the period of its incubation and the difference in degree<lb/>
in the character of its attacks. Further, as these cases were kept<lb/>
under constant observation, even from the time of inoculation, we<lb/>
are not only able to report upon the earliest premonitory symptoms,<lb/>
but also to give the primary temperature curve; and, in addition, to<lb/>
note the time of appearance of albumin in the urine, all of which are<lb/>
of interest in the clinical history of yellow fever.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Period of incubation</hi>.--The accurate determination of the period<lb/>
of incubation of any one of the acute infectious diseases is always a<lb/>
matter of scientific interest. If the disease is one which, like yellow<lb/>
fever, is of exotic origin and whose importation is liable to give rise<lb/>
to a widespread epidemic, then the determination of its incubative<lb/>
stages becomes of the highest practical importance. This importance,<lb/>
as a question of public hygiene, is increased, if as recent observations<lb/>
would seem to indicate, the importation of this disease is brought<lb/>
about only by the sick individual and not by his baggage or clothing.<lb/>
While the older authors were willing to prolong the period of incuba-<lb/>
tion of yellow fever to 2 or 3 weeks or even longer, <hi>the tendency of<lb/>
physicians at the present time is to shorten this stage to about 5 days</hi>.<lb/>
Reference to a few of the later text-books on the Practice of Medicine<lb/>
will sufficiently indicate this. Davidson, in Allbutt's System,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> puts<lb/>
down the period of incubation as &ldquo;ranging between 24 hours and 4<lb/>
or 5 days.&rdquo; Stevens<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> says that it may vary from &ldquo;a few hours to a<lb/>
week.&rdquo; Osler<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> says that &ldquo;the period of incubation is usually 3 or 4<lb/>
days, but it may be less than 24 hours or prolonged to 7 days.&rdquo;<lb/>
According to Tyson,<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> &ldquo;yellow fever has a period of incubation of<lb/>
from 24 hours to 5 days, very rarely exceeding the latter.&rdquo; Stern-<lb/>
berg<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> says that this period &ldquo;does not usually exceed 4 or 5 days and<lb/>
may be less than 24 hours.&rdquo; <hi>Carter,<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> in a recent valuable</hi> paper,<lb/>
gives the results of his studies on the period of incubation of yellow<lb/>
fever, based on observations extending over a considerable number<lb/>
of years. Under Class III of his observations, which are the most<lb/>
valuable, he includes &ldquo;those persons who, living in a clean environ-<lb/>
ment, go into an infected one, stay only a short time, and then return<lb/>
to a clean environment where they remain until the fever develops.&rdquo;</p>

<p><hi>The average period of incubation of the 16 cases embraced in<lb/>
Table I will be found to be 87 1&sol;4 hours, or 3 days 15 1&sol;4 hours</hi>. If we<lb/>
separate the 12 mosquito infections from the 4 cases produced by the<lb/>
injection of blood, we have for the former a period of incubation of<lb/>
94 hours or <hi>3 days and 22 hours</hi>, and for the latter an incubative<lb/>
stage of 67 1&sol;2 hours, or <hi>2 days 19 1&sol;2 hours</hi>. The average period of incu-<lb/>
bation, therefore, in the cases brought about by subcutaneous injec-<lb/>
tion of blood was shorter by 26 1&sol;2 hours than those occasioned by the<lb/>
mosquito's bite. By the former method, this stage varied from 43<lb/>
hours to 94 hours, while in <hi>the mosquito infections the shortest incu-<lb/>
bative period was 70 and the longest 146 hours</hi>. If we accept those<lb/>
cases produced by the mosquito's bite as the usual method of propa-<lb/>
gation of this disease, it will be observed that of the 12 cases 1 occurred<lb/>
on the third day, 9 on the fourth day, 1 on the sixth day, and 1 at<lb/>
the beginning of the seventh day after incubation.</p>
<p>While our results, therefore, confirm the statement of later writers<lb/>
that the period of incubation of yellow fever does not usually exceed<lb/>
4 or 5 days, <hi>they also seem to indicate very plainly that this stage<lb/>
may be prolonged more frequently, perhaps, than had been supposed</hi>.</p>
<p><hi>In 16.6 per cent of our cases the period of incubation exceeded the<lb/>
usual quarantine period of 5 days</hi>. If we add Carter's cases to those<lb/>
observed by us, we find that of 24 cases the period of incubation</p>

<p>exceeded 5 days in 3, or 12.5 per cent. We will not further dwell<lb/>
on this subject than to remark that <hi>cases No. 2 and No. 4 of our series<lb/>
could have passed quarantine on the morning of the sixth day<lb/>
after inoculation, with a clinical thermometer under the tongue, with-<lb/>
out exciting any suspicion by reason of the presence of fever</hi>.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Character of the attack</hi>.--We desire to call attention particularly to<lb/>
the difference in the degree of severity of the attack as shown by our<lb/>
experimental cases. Like all of the other acute infectious diseases,<lb/>
we have reason to expect that yellow fever will affect different indi-<lb/>
viduals according to their individual susceptibilities, and hence that<lb/>
we will encounter mild as well as severe cases. The results which<lb/>
we have obtained confirm this expectation. Based upon the char-<lb/>
acter of the attack, the 12 cases due to mosquito inoculation may be<lb/>
divided as follows:</p>
<p>
<table rows="6" cols="2">

</p>
<p>Thus the cases which were mild or very mild in character consti-<lb/>
tuted 33 per cent of those infected by the mosquito's bite and 25 of<lb/>
those produced by blood injection. It is to the diagnosis of the former<lb/>
cases that we desire to direct special attention. To one familiar with<lb/>
yellow fever, or even to one unfamiliar with its clinical features, the<lb/>
diagnosis of our <hi>severe and moderately severe cases should have pre-<lb/>
sented no difficulty</hi>. The <hi>sharp headache and backache, the charac-<lb/>
teristic facies, the ocular jaundice, together with the presence of albu-<lb/>
min in the urine, except in 1 case to be hereafter referred</hi> to, with the<lb/>
negative result of a blood examination, would have been a sufficient<lb/>
complex of symptoms to have rendered the diagnosis tolerably certain.<lb/>
Even in our 3 &ldquo;mild&rdquo; cases, were the physician on his guard and<lb/>
acquainted with the temperature curve and pulse from the very onset<lb/>
of the attack and, besides, careful in the testing of each specimen of<lb/>
urine passed, a diagnosis of yellow fever could have been made with<lb/>
reasonable probability. We believe, however, that, in the ordinary<lb/>
course of events, where there was no reason to suspect the presence<lb/>
of yellow fever the <hi>average practitioner would have probably failed<lb/>
to appreciate the true nature of these attacks</hi>. Such was the admis-<lb/>
sion which we ourselves were compelled to make, although in con-<lb/>
stant attendance and thoroughly acquainted with these cases from<lb/>
their very beginning. The short duration of the primary fever in one<lb/>
instance; the rapid amelioration of the earlier symptoms in all; the<lb/>
absence of albumen during the first 3 days, or its presence, as a mere<lb/>
trace, in certain specimens, followed by its absence in succeeding<lb/>
specimens; the slight icteroid hue of the conjunctiva--to be obtained<lb/>
only in a certain light and then doubtfully--all served to render a<lb/>

positive diagnosis exceedingly difficult. Several physicians, who saw<lb/>
these milder cases at our request, readily acknowledged the improba-<lb/>
bility of a correct diagnosis being made in the absence of the complete<lb/>
data which we were able to furnish concerning them. <hi>In the one case<lb/>
which we have classed as &ldquo;very mild&rdquo; yellow</hi> fever we believe that<lb/>
the matter of a correct diagnosis would have been in the highest de-<lb/>
gree improbable. The attack consisted of a single paroxysm of 33<lb/>
hours' duration, during which the temperature only reached 101&deg; for a<lb/>
period of 6 hours. It is true that albumin was found in the urine at<lb/>
the end of 37 hours, but the quantity was exceedingly small and only<lb/>
to be detected by the most delicate testing. It was only present in 1<lb/>
or 2 specimens passed on the third day. A slight trace was present in<lb/>
a specimen passed at 9 a. m. of the fourth day and in that passed at<lb/>
4.40 p. m. of the fifth day. Intervening specimens of urine, several in<lb/>
number, contained no albumin. A well-marked papular eruption<lb/>
which appeared on the fourth day of the disease, and which was con-<lb/>
fined to the trunk and arms, would hardly have rendered the diag-<lb/>
nosis easier. We suppose that during the prevalance of an epidemic<lb/>
of yellow fever a physician who was thoroughly acquainted with the<lb/>
several types of this disease would probably class this case as one of<lb/>
extremely mild yellow fever, with a wide margin for doubt. Under<lb/>
all other circumstances we feel confident that cases of this character<lb/>
would escape diagnosis. That cases of mild yellow fever may and do<lb/>
serve as foci for the development of other cases our own observations<lb/>
demonstrate, since we have been able to propagate the disease from one<lb/>
such mild case by means of the bites of contaminated mosquitoes, and<lb/>
from another case of like character by the subcutaneous injection of<lb/>
2 c. c. of blood.</p>
<p>THE ONSET AND PREMONITORY SYMPTOMS.</p>
<p>Of the 12 cases produced by mosquito inoculation, the onset was<lb/>
sudden in 2 and gradual in 10. In both of the former the attack<lb/>
occurred during the night, the patient, also, in both instances, being<lb/>
awakened by the occurrence of a decided chill. In 1 of the 2 cases of<lb/>
sudden onset, the subject complained of slight supraorbital headache<lb/>
during the afternoon preceding the attack. Of 4 cases produced by<lb/>
the injection of blood, the onset was sudden in 1--the only case<lb/>
marked by a chill--and gradual in 3. The attack in all of these<lb/>
blood cases began during the daytime. As writers generally state<lb/>
that in yellow fever the chances of infection are greater during the<lb/>
night, we have thought that, perhaps, the time of inoculation of our<lb/>
experimental cases (which was during the day except in 1 instance),<lb/>
might have had some influence upon their occurrence, as a rule,<lb/>
during the daytime. If the hour of inoculation in all of our cases<lb/>
should have taken place at about sunset, then, with the same period<lb/>
of incubation, 7, or 43 per cent would have experienced their attacks<lb/>
at night.</p>
<p>Of the 13 cases in which the onset was gradual--by mosquito<lb/>
inoculation, 10; by blood injection, 3--frontal headache, the pain<lb/>
being referred to the supraorbital region and extending into the<lb/>
temporal region, was the most frequent premonitory symptom. It<lb/>
was present in 10 and absent in 3 cases. This symptom preceded<lb/>
the attack in these cases at intervals varying from 2 to 48 hours.<lb/>
<pb n="127" id="S8220135"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
127<lb/>
In 2 cases no premonitory headache was complained of, while in 1<lb/>
case occipital headache preceded the onset by 24 hours, and con-<lb/>
tinued to be of this character throughout the attack. Dizziness was<lb/>
complained of by 3 of the gradually developing mosquito cases, and<lb/>
a sense of weight in the lower extremities by the 2 others belonging<lb/>
to this group. All of the cases of gradual onset (13 in number) com-<lb/>
plained of lassitude and want of appetite, on which account all took<lb/>
to their beds prior to the onset of fever. Ten of these individuals<lb/>
complained of slight sensations of chilliness--generally confined to<lb/>
the lower extremities--at the beginning of the attack, while in 3<lb/>
this symptom was entirely absent. In our experimental cases,<lb/>
therefore, frontal headache and muscular debility were the most<lb/>
frequent and prominent premonitory symptoms. After the attack<lb/>
had developed, the symptoms correspond to those described at<lb/>
length by various writers and with which all are familiar, except that<lb/>
black vomit did not occur in any of our cases.</p>
<p>THE FEVER.</p>
<p>As we have had prepared charts of our several cases of experi-<lb/>
mental yellow fever, from which all the data concerning temperature<lb/>
and pulse can be obtained, it will not be necessary for us to make<lb/>
extended remarks under this heading. <hi>Medication being practically<lb/>
nil in our cases, both temperature-curve and pulse can be accepted as<lb/>
faithfully representing what normally takes place in an attack of<lb/>
this disease</hi>. When ice water enemas or cold sponge baths were<lb/>
used by the attending physician, this is noted on the chart. It<lb/>
should also be remembered that our patients were put to bed at the<lb/>
very first manifestation of the disease, and <hi>carefully transported to<lb/>
the yellow-fever wards on the very same beds which they had occu-<lb/>
pied in camp</hi>. This probably had some effect upon the subsequent<lb/>
course of the fever. The <hi>record of temperature being taken every</hi> 3<lb/>
hours from the <hi>time of inoculation</hi> enables us to give the complete<lb/>
curves of both the primary and secondary febrile paroxysm. Our<lb/>
charts therefore differ considerably from those given by the various<lb/>
writers on yellow fever in that they round out, as it were, the primary<lb/>
stage more fully. An examination of these charts will show that<lb/>
although the primary rise of temperature is tolerably abrupt and<lb/>
reaches its height within a comparatively short time, it does not<lb/>
reach its maximum so quickly as the description of writers would<lb/>
seem to indicate. The trihourly record in 10 of our mosquito inocu-<lb/>
lations shows that this period of primary rise varies from 12 to 24<lb/>
hours. In 3 cases it was 12 hours; in 2, 15 hours; in 1, 15 1&sol;2 hours;<lb/>
in 1, 20 1&sol;2 hours; in 1, 22 1&sol;2 hours; and in 2, 24 hours. The average<lb/>
period of the 10 cases was therefore a fraction over 16 hours.</p>
<p>In striking contrast to these was the short period of the primary<lb/>
rise of temperature in the 4 cases produced by blood injection. In<lb/>
these it varied from 2 1&sol;4 to 9 hours, the remaining 2 cases giving 6 and<lb/>
7 hours respectively, the average for the 4 cases being only 6 hours.<lb/>
In all of the 12 cases due to mosquito inoculation, the primary rise of<lb/>
temperature was followed by a distinct remission or intermission,<lb/>
which was generally reached within 48 hours. The same remission<lb/>
was present in 3 of the 4 cases produced by blood injection. We are<lb/>
<pb n="128" id="S8220136"/>

able to give the duration of the primary paroxysm accurately in the<lb/>
10 cases produced at Camp Lazear by the bites of mosquitos, viz.:</p>

<p>The average duration of these 10 cases was 43 hours. In the 3<lb/>
cases caused by the injection of blood the length of the primary<lb/>
paroxysm was 24 hours in 2 cases and 36 hours in 1 case--the average<lb/>
being 28 hours. We may therefore say that not only the average<lb/>
period of incubation, but also the primary rise of temperature, as<lb/>
well as the length of the first febrile stage were all shorter in the<lb/>
cases produced by blood injection than in those due to the mos-<lb/>
quito's bite. Of the 12 cases due to the latter mode of inoculation<lb/>
the first febrile stage was followed by an intermission in 2, and a<lb/>
remission in 10 cases. Of those produced by the injection of blood,<lb/>
3 showed a distinct remission and 1 no intervening fall of tempera-<lb/>
ture. The duration of this intermission varied from 3 to 27 hours.<lb/>
This was followed by a second febrile stage or paroxysm in 11 of the<lb/>
12 mosquito inoculations, and in 3 of the 4 cases due to the injection<lb/>
of blood. The duration of this second febrile paroxysm was from 2<lb/>
to 5 days.</p>
<p>Experimental yellow fever then, as we saw it at Camp Lazear,<lb/>
consisted of a primary and secondary febrile paroxysm, with an<lb/>
intervening remission or intermission--more frequently the former.<lb/>
The secondary was much longer than the primary febrile stage.</p>
<p>In 1 of our mosquito inoculations a relapse occurred on the ninth<lb/>
day of the disease, and was characterized also by 2 febrile stages<lb/>
with an intervening remission. There were present headache and<lb/>
backache, with injection of the eyes and face, together with hemorr-<lb/>
hage from the gums, as had been observed in the primary attack.</p>
<p>The want of correlation between temperature and pulse (Faget's<lb/>
law), upon which clinicians rely as an important diagnostic sign,<lb/>
was seen as a rule in our experimental cases, i. e., after the passage<lb/>
of the first febrile stage. In 1 case produced by the injection of<lb/>
blood, Faget's law was not complied with.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The urine</hi>.--We have confined our examination of the urine largely<lb/>
to testing for the presence of albumin and to the ordinary microscopic<lb/>
examination of this fluid. Heat and nitric acid was the method used<lb/>
in all cases for the detection of albumin, the specimen having first<lb/>
been carefully filtered.</p>
<p>Under this heading we desire to speak only concerning the pres-<lb/>
ence of albumin. All writers dwell on the importance of a careful<lb/>
examination of the urine in suspicious cases of fever, since the pres-<lb/>
ence of albumin in the urine is such a constant sign in yellow fever.<lb/>

day of the disease. It may be very transient. In many mild cases<lb/>
the albumin is present only in the urine passed in the evening of the<lb/>
third of fourth day. In many cases it is only a trace.&rdquo; We may<lb/>
say that the results obtained from examination of the urine of experi-<lb/>
mental yellow fever accords for the most part with the statements<lb/>
above quoted.</p>

<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Albumin did not appear till 36 hours after fever had subsided and persisted for five days.</p>
<p>In our earlier cases we did not examine for albumin until the onset<lb/>
of the attack. In our last 8 cases (those embraced in this report) we<lb/>
examined daily specimens from the time of inoculation unit the attack<lb/>
began, and thereafter we endeavored to examine every specimen<lb/>
passed by the patient. Table II gives the results obtained.</p>
<p>An examination of the cases presented in this table will show that<lb/>
of the 12 mosquito inoculations the earliest appearance of albumin<lb/>
was at the beginning of the second day in 1 case; during the second<lb/>
day in 5; at the end of the second day in 1; during the third day in 1;<lb/>
during the fourth day in 2; during the fifth day in 1; while in 1--a<lb/>
well-marked case--no albumin could be detected till 36 hours after<lb/>
the temperature had reached the normal, i.e., till the second day of<lb/>
convalescence; it then persisted during 5 days. In all 23 specimens<lb/>
of urine were examined in this case during the 6 days of fever, but<lb/>
with an entirely negative result as regards the presence of albumin.<lb/>
An occasional hyaline or fine granular cast could be found in the<lb/>
majority of these specimens. We submit this case of experimental<lb/>
yellow fever as one of especial importance from the clinical stand-<lb/>
point, since the absence of albumin during the attack would have<lb/>
probably led to an error in diagnosis. How very exceptional such<lb/>
cases may be we have no means of knowing.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>

were kept at absolute rest during the whole period of the fever, the<lb/>
amount of albumin was small in 6 and insignificant in 8. We are<lb/>
inclined to believe, therefore, that both the course of the fever, as<lb/>
well as the quantity of albumin, were favorably affected by the early<lb/>
enforced rest of our patients.</p>
<p>In conclusion we desire to invite attention to 2 matters which we<lb/>
consider of considerable importance in connection with the possible<lb/>
importation and propagation of yellow fever. First, we believe that<lb/>
the facts herewith presented indicate that the period of incubation of<lb/>
yellow fever occasionally exceeds the quarantine period of 5 days,<lb/>
and that although exceptional this must not be left out of considera-<lb/>
tion. Secondly, that our observations emphasize anew the impor-<lb/>
tance of the recognition by the profession of mild and very mild cases<lb/>
of yellow fever. Guiteras<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>says: &ldquo;I can not insist too much upon<lb/>
the importance of the diagnosis of the first case of yellow fever in a<lb/>
locality.&rdquo; He adds: &ldquo;Undoubtedly the cause of the epidemic of yel-<lb/>
low fever is to be found in the introduction into a community of cases<lb/>
that are not suspected to be yellow fever.&rdquo;. In the light of our inves-<lb/>
tigations, we feel constrained to remark that the failure to detect<lb/>
cases of mild yellow fever has been, we believe, the most important<lb/>
factor in the development of the theory of the propagation of this<lb/>
disease by fomites.</p>

<head>THE PREVENTION OF YELLOW FEVER<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></head>
<byline>By <docAuthor>WALTER REED</docAuthor>, M. D., Surgeon, United States Army, and JAMES CARROLL, M. D.,<lb/>
Contract Surgeon, United States Army.</byline>
<p><hi>The prevention of yellow fever</hi> since its first importation into the<lb/>
United States in 1693, and especially during the latter half of the<lb/>
past century, <hi>has commanded, perhaps, more attention on the part<lb/>
of those who were concerned with matters pertaining to the</hi> public<lb/>
health than the prevention of <hi>any of the other acute infections</hi>.<lb/>
This has not been occasioned by the fact that its total sickness and<lb/>
mortality have exceeded that of other acute infectious diseases, such<lb/>
as typhoid fever or croupous pneumonia, but <hi>because rather of the<lb/>
proximity of its source to our shores</hi>; the lack of knowledge of its<lb/>
specific agent; <hi>the consequent mystery surrounding its origin</hi> and<lb/>
propagation; the <hi>alarmingly rapid spread and course of this</hi> disease,<lb/>
when once it had obtained a foothold, and <hi>the high mortality with<lb/>
which its epidemics have generally been</hi> attended. Although the<lb/>
duration of its presence in our seaports was plainly limited by certain<lb/>
seasonal conditions, yet during its brief reign--July to October--its<lb/>
<hi>ravages were such as to completely paralyze both the social and com-<lb/>
mercial interests of a given city</hi>, and even of an entire section of our<lb/>
country.</p>
<p>The interval between 1793 and 1888 is almost 100 years, but upon<lb/>
the appearance of yellow fever we observe <hi>no difference of behavior</hi><lb/>
on the part of inhabitants of Jackson, Miss., in 1888, from that<lb/>
shown by the citizens of Philadelphia in 1793, except that <hi>the terror<lb/>
of the former was greater and their flight from their homes more<lb/>
precipitate than in the case of the latter</hi>.</p>
<p>The recurrence of succeeding epidemics has, therefore, served to<lb/>
increase rather than to lessen the public alarm.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to determine with accuracy the loss of life<lb/>
occasioned by the <hi>95 invasions of our territory by yellow fever during<lb/>
the past 208 years</hi>. We have endeavored to collect from the most<lb/>
available sources the mortality caused by this disease, but have been<lb/>
unable to obtain any reliable data for the earlier epidemics. If we<lb/>
confine ourselves to the epidemics which have <hi>occurred since 1793</hi>,<lb/>
we find that there have not been <hi>less than 100,000 deaths from this</hi><lb/>
cause. The greatest sufferer has been the city of New Orleans, with<lb/>
41,348 deaths, followed by the city of Philadelphia, with 10,038<lb/>
deaths. The epidemics of 1855, 1873, 1878, and 1879 claimed 7,759<lb/>
victims in the city of Memphis, Tenn. From 1800 to 1876, Charleston<lb/>
lost 4,565 of its citizens by attacks of yellow fever. New York,<lb/>
during the earlier and later invasions of this disease, has had 3,454<lb/>
deaths, while the epidemic of 1855 in Norfolk, Va., caused over 2,000</p>

<p>deaths. <hi>During or brief occupation of the island of Cuba (July</hi><lb/>
1898-December, 1900), with <hi>every precaution brought into</hi> exercise<lb/>
to ward off the disease, <hi>there have occurred among the officers and<lb/>
men of our Army 1,575 cases of yellow fever, with 231 deaths</hi>.</p>
<p>If we reckon the <hi>average mortality at 20 per cent, there have not<lb/>
been less than 500,000 cases of yellow fever in the United States<lb/>
during the period from 1793</hi> to 1900.</p>
<p>Turning for a moment to other countries, we find that the great<lb/>
epidemic of 1800, in the province of Andalusia, Spain, caused 60,000<lb/>
deaths, and that 20,000 more deaths attended the invasion of the<lb/>
city of Barcelona by this disease in 1821. From 1851 to 1883, the<lb/>
deaths from this cause in the city of Rio de Janeiro were 23,338,<lb/>
while in the city of Habana, between the years 1853 and 1900, 35,952<lb/>
deaths have been recorded from yellow fever.</p>
<p>We have no means of computing the damage done to the commercial<lb/>
interests of the United States by epidemics of yellow fever. At the<lb/>
sixth annual meeting of this association, held in Richmond. Va.. in<lb/>
1878, Dr. Samuel Choppin, president of the State board of health of<lb/>
Louisiana, estimated the <hi>actual cost of the epidemic of that year</hi> to<lb/>
the material resources of the city of New <hi>Orleans as $10,752,500</hi>.<lb/>
Dr. Benjamin Lee, the present distinguished occupant of the presi-<lb/>
dential chair, at the seventeenth annual meeting of this association,<lb/>
held in Brooklyn, N. Y., in 1889, contributed a paper having the<lb/>
title, &ldquo;Do the Sanitary Interests of the United States Demand the<lb/>
Annexation of Cuba?&rdquo; From this we quote the following sentence;<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi>A single widespread epidemic of yellow fever would cost the United<lb/>
States more in money, to say nothing of the grief and misery which<lb/>
it would entail, than the purchase money of</hi> Cuba.&rdquo; That this<lb/>
was no exaggeration, witness the language of the petition which the<lb/>
chairman of the committee on the etiology of yellow fever, in con-<lb/>
junction with other prominent members of this association, presented<lb/>
to the President of the United States on November 15, 1897, and<lb/>
again, on November 21, 1898, in accordance with a resolution adopted<lb/>
at the meeting of this association, held at Ottawa, Canada, in 1897.<lb/>
In addressing President McKinley, Dr. Horlbeck said: &ldquo;It is hardly<lb/>
necessary to call your attention to the serious results of the recent<lb/>
epidemic of yellow fever in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and<lb/>
Alabama, but we may be permitted to mention the fact that the<lb/>
<hi>great epidemic of</hi> 1878 resulted in the loss of nearly 16, 000 lives, and<lb/>
that it has been estimated that the total loss to the country resulting<lb/>
from this epidemic was not <hi>less than $100,000,000</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The importance of the study of the causative factors entering into<lb/>
the propagation of a disease so capable of quickly destroying the lives<lb/>
of the citizens and wrecking the commercial interests of the cities<lb/>
of the United States could hardly be overestimated. Did time<lb/>
permit, we would be glad to refer to the numerous and valuable<lb/>
contributions made to this subject by the members of the American<lb/>
Health Association. We can only mention the establishment of the<lb/>
National Board of Health and <hi>the appointment of the Habana Yellow<lb/>
Fever Commission of 1879 as two of the most important outcomes of<lb/>
the persistent efforts of this association, following &ldquo;the deeply tragical<lb/>
events of the summer of 1878.&rdquo;</hi> The exhaustive reports made by<lb/>
Chaille in 1880, and by Sternberg in 1890, must always stand as<lb/>
monuments to the earnest spirit of investigation with which the work<lb/>
was pursued.</p>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
133</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the importance of the work and the efforts put<lb/>
forth by students in this and other countries, we believe that we are<lb/>
safe in saying that no results had been obtained which would enable<lb/>
us to combat successfully this disease when once imported into our<lb/>
larger centers of population, and no means found to keep it out of<lb/>
our ports except such as would place very heavy burdens upon com-<lb/>
merce. This inability to control the disease grew not only out of our<lb/>
ignorance as to the way or ways in which yellow fever was propagated,<lb/>
but also out of certain false opinions which we had formed as to the<lb/>
mode of its spread. The doctrine of the spread of yellow fever by<lb/>
<hi>fomites and by filth had taken such hold on the professional mind<lb/>
as completely to overshadow all other views, and to direct into false<lb/>
channels the work of those who were engaged in the investigation of<lb/>
this disease</hi>. The efforts to isolate or to discover the specific agent of<lb/>
yellow fever, if successful, would possibly have greatly simplified the<lb/>
problem; in the absence of such discovery, the first step in our knowl-<lb/>
edge of how to prevent this disease could only be found, we think,<lb/>
along another line, viz, that of its propagation from the sick to the<lb/>
well. This step we endeavored to take in connection with our col-<lb/>
leagues, Dr. Agramonte and the late Dr. J. W. Lazear of the United<lb/>
States Army, during our recent investigations into the causation and<lb/>
spread of yellow fever at Quemados, Cuba.</p>
<p>The results of our earlier work relative to the etiology and propa-<lb/>
gation of this disease we had the pleasure of presenting to this asso-<lb/>
ciation at its last meeting, held in indianapolis, Ind.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> You will recall<lb/>
that one of the conclusions which we then submitted was as follows:<lb/>
&ldquo;The mosquito serves as the intermediate host for the parasite of<lb/>
yellow fever.&rdquo; In the same article, we briefly indicated the reasons<lb/>
which influenced us in pursuing this line of investigation, and it is,<lb/>
therefore, unnecessary here to repeat them.</p>
<p>Continuing our studies, especially as regards the means by which<lb/>
yellow fever is spread from individual to individual, and as to the<lb/>
manner in which houses become infected, we were able, under strict<lb/>
rules of isolation and quarantine, to bring about an attack of yellow<lb/>
fever in <hi>10 nonimmune individuals (and always</hi> within the period of<lb/>
incubation of this disease) <hi>out of a total of 13 (76.84 per cent)</hi> whom<lb/>
we attempted to infect <hi>by means of the bites of mosquitoes</hi>--<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia<lb/>
fasciata</hi>--that had previously been fed with the blood of yellow-fever<lb/>
patients during the first, second, and third days of their attacks.<lb/>
These results were reported in part to the Pan-American Congress<lb/>
held in Habana during February of this year,<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> and in part to the<lb/>
Associatoin of American Physicians at its last meeting, held in the city<lb/>
of Washington.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi></p>
<p>It will be seen that we were able to establish in the most conclusive<lb/>
manner that the mosquito does serve as the intermediate host for<lb/>
the parasite of yellow fever. At this same experimental sanitary<lb/>
station we were also able to demonstrate that an attack of yellow<lb/>
fever can not be induced by the most intimate and prolonged contact<lb/>
with the clothing and bedding of yellow-fever patients, even though<lb/>
these articles had been previously thoroughly and purposely soiled<lb/>
with the excreta of such patients. In other words, we were able to</p>

<p>prove that the garments worn, and the bedding used, by yellow-fever<lb/>
patients were no more concerned in propagating this disease than the<lb/>
clothing and bedding of patients suffering from malarial fever are<lb/>
concerned in the spread of the latter malady. <hi>The doctrine of the<lb/>
spread of yellow fever by fomites having, at the first touch of actual<lb/>
experiment on human beings, burst like a bubble</hi>, we may hereafter<lb/>
cast it aside, with other exploded beliefs, to the very great simplifi-<lb/>
cation of the problem how to prevent yellow fever. Indeed, in our<lb/>
opinion, the time has now arrived when the latter problem may be<lb/>
reduced to measures which shall prevent the propagation of this dis-<lb/>
ease by mosquitoes. Although this specific agent of yellow fever has<lb/>
not, as yet, been discovered, this must remain largely a matter of<lb/>
scientific interest, and does not in the least lessen the efforts which<lb/>
we, as sanitarians, are now able for the first time to bring into action<lb/>
for the prevention of the spread of this disease, since in dealing with<lb/>
the mosquito we are dealing with the intermediate host which carries<lb/>
the specific agent from the sick to the well.</p>
<p>In considering, then, in a broad way, the prevention of yellow fever,<lb/>
the natural order would be to give our attention, first, to measures<lb/>
which will prevent the importation of this disease from infected<lb/>
places into the seaports of the United States; and secondly, to meas-<lb/>
ures which will most effectually prevent the spread of this disease,<lb/>
provided it should gain a lodgment in one of the cities of this country.</p>
<p>With your permission, however, we will reverse the order of con-<lb/>
sideration above suggested, and will later refer in the briefest manner<lb/>
to the prevention of the importation of yellow fever into the United<lb/>
States from foreign ports, as this part of the subject will be presented<lb/>
by the health officer of the port of New York, who, from long expe-<lb/>
rience, will be able to deal more intelligently than we with this part<lb/>
of the problem</p>
<p>Since the mosquito, especially that species of stegomyia which has<lb/>
recently been designated by Theobald as <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi> (formerly<lb/>
known to entomologists as <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi> Fab.), has become so prom-<lb/>
inent a factor in the spread of yellow fever, it becomes necessary to<lb/>
consider this insect from the point of view of its identification; its<lb/>
habitat; its breeding places; the length of its generation; its hours<lb/>
of feeding; the influence of temperature upon both its propagation<lb/>
and stinging; the interval after contamination before the insect<lb/>
becomes capable of propagating the disease; the length of time during<lb/>
which it remains dangerous; the measures that should be used not<lb/>
only to protect the sick against the bites of these insects, but also to<lb/>
prevent the latter from infecting the healthy individual; and, finally,<lb/>
a consideration of the several agents which may be successfully<lb/>
employed both to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes as well as<lb/>
directed toward their destruction in the adult stage.</p>
<p>Aside from the standpoint of scientific interest, it is certainly a<lb/>
matter of hygienic importance, in taking up the question of how to<lb/>
prevent the spread of yellow fever, when imported into the United<lb/>
States, that the health authorities of our several coast cities, and,<lb/>
indeed, of some of our inland towns, should be able to determine<lb/>
whether the only species of mosquito, which, up to the present time,<lb/>
has been shown capable of conveying yellow fever, is or is not present<lb/>
in these cities. <hi>If it should hereafter be proven that only species of<lb/>
the genus <hi rend="italic">stegomyia</hi> are capable of acting as intermediate hosts for</hi><lb/>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
135<lb/>
<hi>the specific agent of yellow fever, as appears to have been demon</hi>-<lb/>
strated for the geuus <hi rend="italic">anopheles</hi> in the spread of malaria, the presence<lb/>
or absence of the former genus will definitely determine whether<lb/>
yellow fever will or will not spread in a given locality. The presence<lb/>
or absence of mosquitoes that can propagate the disease is the only<lb/>
intellgible explanation of what has heretofore been considered an<lb/>
inexplicable problem, viz, the capability of this disease to propagate<lb/>
itself in certain localities, while in other places it could be introduced<lb/>
with perfect impunity to the public health. In other words, our<lb/>
present knowledge of this question solves, at last, the problem of the<lb/>
portability or nonportability of yellow fever.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Description of mosquito</hi>.--The identification of<hi rend="italic">stegomyia fasciata</hi>,<lb/>
Theobald, should not be difficult. This mosquito, when examined<lb/>
closely with the naked eye and especially with a pocket lens, is a<lb/>
rather <hi>striking-looking and handsome insect</hi>. (Fig. 1.) Its most<lb/>
<hi>conspicuous markings are the broad semilunar silvery stripe, which<lb/>
is seen on the lateral surface of the thorax, and the white stripes at<lb/>
the bases of the tarsal</hi> joints. These may be readily distinguished<lb/>
with the naked eye. The bands on the hind legs are especially well<lb/>
marked, and occasionally the entire fifth hind tarsal joint is seen to<lb/>
be of a pure silvery white. The four stripes of silvery scales which<lb/>
are seen on the posterior surface of the thorax serve to distinguish<lb/>
this species from all other mosquitoes, except <hi rend="italic">stegomyia signifer,<lb/>
Coquillet</hi>, in which, however, as we have been informed by Mr. L. O.<lb/>
Howard, the curved thoracic band is very narrow and of a somewhat<lb/>
different shape. Examined with a hand lens, the four stripes are<lb/>
seen to consist of two lateral, distinct silver lines--the continuation<lb/>
of the semilunar, broad stripes--and two fine, white lines situated<lb/>
between these, and which require that the insect shall be held in the<lb/>
proper light, in order that these delicate threads may be distinctly<lb/>
seen. The lateral surface of the thorax is also marked by several<lb/>
silvery dots and the abdomen by distinct white stripes. This de-<lb/>
scription applies to both sexes. In the female, the palpi are short,<lb/>
as in the genus culex. The proboscis is of a dark blackish-brown<lb/>
color and is destitute of a whitish band near the middle. In the<lb/>
male (fig. 2), one of the front tarsal claws bears a tooth on the under<lb/>
side, while the other claw is destitute of such marking. In the<lb/>
female, both front tarsal claws bear a distinct tooth near the base<lb/>
of the under side of each.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Habitat</hi>.--We have found this mosquito in all of the principal cities<lb/>
of Cuba, and have received specimens from a number of the smaller<lb/>
towns on this island. According to Howard<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> it has been found at<lb/>
Kingston, Jamaica, on the Isle of Pines, and at Bluefields, Nicaragua.<lb/>
He also reports that Theobald has received specimens of this insect<lb/>
from Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, and Malta. In the<lb/>
United States, Howard reports its presence at New Orleans, Natchi-<lb/>
tochez, and Napoleonville, La.,; in eastern Texas; Hot Springs, Ark.;<lb/>
Pelham, Ga.; and from Virginia Beach, near Norfolk, Va. To this<lb/>
we can add Augusta, Ga., from which city we have recently received<lb/>
specimens of <hi rend="italic">stegomyia fasciata</hi> through the courtesy of Dr. T. O.<lb/>
Oertel of that city. Dr. Durham, of the English commission for the<lb/>
study of yellow fever, kindly showed us specimens of this insect which</p>

<p>he had collected at Para, Brazil, and at various places along the<lb/>
Amazon River. It will be seen, therefore, that <hi rend="italic">stegomyia faciata</hi> has<lb/>
a wide distribution in the warmer countries of the globe, and espe-<lb/>
cially at low altitudes. A more exact knowledge of the distribution<lb/>
of this mosquito in the United States is, we think, a matter of con-<lb/>
siderable practical importance.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Breeding places</hi>.--In our search for the larv&aelig;of this insect we have<lb/>
found them in the following places: (1) In rain-water barrels: (2)<lb/>
in sagging gutters containing rain water; (3) in tin cans that had been<lb/>
used for removing excreta and which still contained a small amount of<lb/>
fecal matter; (4) in cesspools; (5) in tin cans placed about table legs<lb/>
to prevent the inroads of red ants; (6) in the collection of water at<lb/>
the base of the leaves of the <hi rend="italic">agave americana</hi>; (7) in one end of a</p>
<p><figure entity="S8220146"></figure> FIG. 1.--Stegomyia fasciata; female. <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, Front tarsal claw.</p>
<p>horse trough that was in daily use. It follows that stegomyia, like<lb/>
culex, will breed in any collection of still water, rain or hydrant, and<lb/>
that the presence of fecal matter does not seem objectionable. Indeed,<lb/>
we have been in the habit of adding a very small quantity of the latter<lb/>
to our breeding jars, as it has seemed to hasten the development<lb/>
of the larv&aelig;. In water, however, which contains much suspended<lb/>
soil-muddy water--the larv&aelig;, in our experience, do not flourish,<lb/>
but die off rather rapidly.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Deposition of eggs</hi>.--The insect lays her eggs during the night, and,<lb/>
unlike culex, which deposits its eggs in boatlike masses, stegomyia<lb/>
extrudes her eggs on the surface of the water in pairs, in groups of<lb/>
three or more, or singly; in this respect resembling anopheles.<lb/>
(Fig. 3.) Exceptionally, the eggs are deposited in a rather close-<lb/>
<pb n="137" id="S8220147"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
137<lb/>
lying mass. (Fig. 4.) The whole batch is laid in one night, or<lb/>
extending over two or three nights. The number of eggs deposited<lb/>
varies from about 20 to about 75--rarely a larger number. Sixteen<lb/>
careful counts gave an average of 47 eggs. At the same time that the<lb/>
female deposits her eggs, she frequently, but not always, discharges a<lb/>
fluid which forms a very thin film over the surface of the water, which<lb/>
possibly assists in floating the eggs. The latter are of a jet-black<lb/>
color and, to the naked eye, cylindrical in shape, one end of the egg<lb/>
being rounded and blunt, while the other is slightly pointed, the<lb/>
whole resembling closely a Conchita cigar. They measure about<lb/>
0.65 mm. in length by 0.17 mm. in width at the broadest part. Under<lb/>
a low power, the surface of the eggs is seen to be marked by tolerably<lb/>
regular six-sided plates, each of which is further marketer in the center</p>
<p><figure entity="S8220147"></figure> FIG. 2,--Stegomyia fasciata; male. <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, Front tarsal elaw.</p>
<p>by a little round elevation, which gives to the surface of the egg a<lb/>
decidedly roughened appearance. (Fig. 5.) Under this low ampli-<lb/>
fication it is also seen that, while one side of the egg is somewhat con-<lb/>
vex, the other is flat or slightly concave and that a cross section of<lb/>
the egg would present the appearance of a triangle instead of that of<lb/>
a cylinder. this flattening of the surface of the egg does not appear<lb/>
to extend quite to the ends, which are round in shape. Although<lb/>
floating perfectly if left undisturbed, any agitation of the water,<lb/>
especially of a rough character, is apt to cause some or a majority<lb/>
of the eggs to sink. If by slight pressure the egg is pushed beneath<lb/>
the surface of the water it at once sinks and does not rise again.<lb/>
This sinking of the eggs does not interfere with their subsequent<lb/>
hatching, as in our experience submerged eggs furnish about as many<lb/>
larv&aelig; as those which are left floating on the surface.</p>

<p>The resistance of stegomyia's eggs to external influences is worthy<lb/>

of May in Washington, furnishing about 60<lb/>
per cent of the usual number of larv&aelig; hatched<lb/>
from fresh eggs. Freezing does not destroy<lb/>
the fertility of the eggs; although freezing with<lb/>
a mixture of salt and ice for 30 minutes has<lb/>
several times seemed to prevent subsequent<lb/>
hatching; on one occasion a batch of 155 eggs,<lb/>
freshly deposited, which were frozen at a tem-<lb/>
perature of -- 17&deg; C., for one hour, then thawed out at room tempera-<lb/>
ture and placed in the incubator at 35&deg; C., began to hatch on the<lb/>
sixth day, the majority furnishing active larv&aelig; on the eighth day.</p>

<p>In another observation, freshly deposited eggs,<lb/>
frozen at -- 17&deg; C. for half an hour on two succes-<lb/>
sive days, began to hatch on the third day as usual<lb/>
at incubator temperature. <hi>The resistance of ste-<lb/>
gomyia's eggs to drying for a period of three<lb/>
months would appear to demonstrate that this<lb/>
genus of mosquito could survive the winter in<lb/>
Habana without the presence of hibernating<lb/>
females. Doubtless the genus is preserved in both<lb/>
ways</hi>. It is probable that the same could occur in<lb/>
our extreme southern latitudes.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Length of generation</hi>.--The impregnated female,<lb/>
having obtained a meal of blood, proceeds to de-<lb/>
posit her eggs, in captivity, after an interval vary-<lb/>
ing in our experience from 2 to 30 days--as a rule, the eggs are laid<lb/>
within 7 days; sometimes a second or third meal of blood is taken<lb/>
before any eggs are laid. Eggs placed under favorable conditions of</p>

<p>warmth--i. e., summer or incu-<lb/>
bator temperature--begin to<lb/>
hatch, as a rule, on the third<lb/>
day, the period extending to<lb/>
about 1 week. The larval stage<lb/>
requires 7 or 8 days, and the<lb/>
pupal stage about 2 days. The<lb/>
period for the generation may<lb/>
be stated, therefore, as follows:<lb/>
Incubation, 3 days; larval stage,<lb/>
7 days; pupal, 2 days; total,<lb/>
12 days. As the eggs begin to<lb/>
hatch before the expiration of<lb/>
the third day, we generally ob-<lb/>
tain a few mosquitoes on the<lb/>
eleventh day. The shortest period of development observed by us dur-<lb/>
ing summer weather in Cuba was incubation, 2 days; larval stage, 6<lb/>
days; pupal, 36 hours; making the total length of this generation 9 1&sol;2<lb/>
days. This short period we believe to be quite exceptional. The<lb/>
<pb n="139" id="S8220149"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
139<lb/>
first fully developed insects begin to emerge on the eleventh or twelfth<lb/>
day, and the whole number have reached maturity by the fifteenth<lb/>
or eighteenth day after deposition of the eggs. The young larv&aelig;, in<lb/>
emerging, rupture the shell at a point about one-fifth the length of<lb/>
the egg from the larger end. This cap-like end can be frequently<lb/>
seen turned back and still adhering to the rest of the shell. (Fig. 5.)<lb/></p>
<p>The larva and pupa of stegomyia (figs. 6 and 7) resemble fairly<lb/>
closely those of culex, and the larv&aelig; maintain the same relative<lb/>
position to the surface of the water; i. e., while in<lb/>
the act of breathing they assume a vertical posi-<lb/>
tion, with the head directed downward.</p>
<p><figure entity="S8220149"></figure> FIG. 6.--Stegomyia fasci-<lb/>

<p><hi rend="italic">Influence of temperature on propagation</hi>.--We<lb/>
have just seen that at summer temperatures the<lb/>
time required for a complete generation of this<lb/>
insect is from 11 to 18 days. We may say that<lb/>
at an average temperature of 75&deg; F., or over,<lb/>
stegomyia multiplies abundantly. Exposure to a<lb/>
cooler temperature, even for a short time daily,<lb/>
much retards the development of this mosquito.<lb/>
Thus, a batch of 51 eggs kept at 35&deg; C., but which<lb/>
were placed in a cool chamber at 20&deg; C. for two<lb/>
hours daily during the whole process of develop-<lb/>
ment, although furnishing a few larv&aelig; at the end<lb/>
of the third day, were not all hatched until the<lb/>
eleventh day. The first pup&aelig; appeared on the<lb/>
fourteenth day and the first mosquito on the<lb/>
nineteenth day; the whole process being completed in 27 days, instead<lb/>
of the usual 15 to 18 days. The loss of insects was about 50 per cent.<lb/>
Eggs kept at a temperature of 20&deg; C. (68&deg; F.) do not hatch, in our<lb/>
experience. Newly hatched larv&aelig; kept at this temperature develop<lb/>
very slowly and require about 20 days to reach the pupal stage. Mos-<lb/>
quitoes developed under such conditions are feeble, and but few<lb/>
arrive at maturity. Young larv&aelig; kept at 10&deg; C. (50&deg; F.) have failed<lb/>
to reach the pupal stage, although some growth takes place. In one</p>
<p><figure entity="S8220149"></figure> FIG. 7.--Stegomyia<lb/>
fasciata. Pupa, en-<lb/>
larged.</p>
<p>experiment more than 50 per cent were dead at the<lb/>
end of two weeks, and none survived the thirty-sec-<lb/>
ond day. Half-grown larv&aelig; and pup&aelig; exposed to a<lb/>
temperature of 20&deg; C., and even as low as 10&deg; C., con-<lb/>
tinue to develop slowly, but the few insects which<lb/>
escape drowning have, as a rule, been of feeble<lb/>
strength and have refused to bite. Although the<lb/>
reduction of the temperature to the freezing point,<lb/>
or below, would not necessarily destroy the vitality<lb/>
of the eggs of this genus of mosquito, it should be<lb/>
remembered that a reduction of temperature to 68&deg; F.,<lb/>
or below, for even a few hours of the 24 will much<lb/>
retard the development of the generation. At a temperature less than<lb/>
68&deg; F. the eggs of this insect have ceased to hatch.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Influence of temperature on biting</hi>.--<hi>While the nonimpregnated<lb/>
female does not appear to bite, the impregnated female is generally<lb/>
ready to bite on the second or third day</hi> of her existence; they very<lb/>
rarely suck blood on the first day. This <hi>species of mosquito</hi>, when <lb/>
not deprived of its liberty, <hi>although occasionally biting during the<lb/>
morning hours, has, in our experience, been especially active from<lb/>
the hour of 4 p. m. till midnight</hi>. In captivity, the hungry impreg-<lb/>
<pb n="140" id="S8220150"/>
140<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
nated female will bite at any hour of the day or night. <hi>The meal of<lb/>
blood appears to have been thoroughly digested on the third day,<lb/>
when the insects, if applied to the surface of the skin, can be again<lb/>
readily induced to feed</hi>. When freed in a room, the female does not<lb/>
appear to bite a second time till about five, or even seven, days have<lb/>
elapsed.</p>
<p>As regards the effect of temperature in the stinging of <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia<lb/>
fasciata</hi>, the results of a number of observations made by us show<lb/>
<hi>that this mosquito will bite at temperatures of 62&deg; F. and above. At<lb/>
temperatures below this point, we have not, as yet, succeeded in in-<lb/>
ducing even very hungry females to suck blood</hi>. We may, therefore,<lb/>
say that observations thus far made appear to show that <hi rend="italic">Stego-<lb/>
myia fasciata</hi>, while not breeding at temperatures below 68&deg; F., will<lb/>
still bite at a temperature as low as 62&deg; F., but probably not at lower<lb/>
temperatures.</p>
<p><hi>If this insect is concerned in the propagation of yellow fever</hi>, it is<lb/>
now quite apparent why an epidemic of this disease should fall to a<lb/>
low ebb in the city of New Orleans during the month of November,<lb/>
with a mean temperature of 61.8&deg; F., and practically cease in Decem-<lb/>
ber, with a mean temperature of 55.3&deg; F. A careful study of the<lb/>
charts herewith submitted (figs. 8 and 9), showing the monthly mean<lb/>
temperatures of the cities of Habana and New Orleans and Habana<lb/>
and Rio de Janeiro together with the relative monthly mortality from<lb/>
yellow fever in these cities, will prove of interest, we think, as show-<lb/>
ing better than laboratory observations the general effect of tempera-<lb/>
ture upon the breeding and biting of <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi>. In the light<lb/>
of recent researches, we can now understand that while yellow fever<lb/>
can, and does, prevail during the entire year in Habana and Rio de<lb/>
Janeiro--although at a comparatively low ebb during the winter<lb/>
months--it can not propagate itself in New Orleans from December<lb/>
to May.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Interval after contamination before the mosquito becomes dangerous</hi>.--<lb/>
In our experimental work on human beings, we have not succeeded<lb/>
in inducing an attack of yellow fever by the bites of mosquitoes which<lb/>
had been kept less than 12 days after contamination. The same<lb/>
insects which failed to convey the disease on the eleventh day were<lb/>
capable of so doing on the seventeenth day after infection. This inter-<lb/>
val of about 12 days, which appears necessary for the development<lb/>
of the parasite within the mosquito, plus the period of incubation,<lb/>
agrees with the time that has been observed to elapse between the<lb/>
introduction of an infecting case into a locality and the occurrence of<lb/>
the first secondary case, viz, two to three weeks.</p>
<p>After the mosquito has once become dangerous, how long it remains<lb/>
capable of conveying the disease, although important, has not been<lb/>
determined. We have reported cases of yellow fever caused by the<lb/>
bites of stegomyia at intervals varying <hi>from 12 to 57 days</hi> after con-<lb/>
tamination. Here the dangerous interval was 45 days, but as one of these<lb/>
insects lived until the seventy-first day after biting a yellow-fever<lb/>
patient, the dangerous interval would here be prolonged to 59 days, or a<lb/>
little over 8 weeks. In our experience, the infected insect appears to<lb/>
live about as long as the noninfected mosquito, so that the answer to this<lb/>
question would depend upon the length of life of the mosquito. This<lb/>
we do not know. While in captivity, the majority of mosquitoes do<lb/>
<pb n="141" id="S8220151"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
141<lb/>
not survive, with the best of care, more than about five weeks, and<lb/>
many die within half of this time; we are ignorant as to the length of<lb/>
time during which they may live when under natural conditions.<lb/>
Certainly, during summer weather this will depend largely on the<lb/>
opportunity which the mosquito has of obtaining access to water.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Measures to prevent the spread of the disease when imported</hi>.--A case<lb/>
of yellow fever having been imported into one of our seaport cities,<lb/>
we are now prepared to discuss the measures that should be taken<lb/>
to prevent its spread. <hi>The problem resolves itself into the simple<lb/>
one of excluding mosquitoes from access to the sick individual and<lb/>
of destroying those insects that have already become infected</hi>. We<lb/>
can leave out of consideration any danger from wearing apparel or<lb/>
baggage, which, in our opinion, may be dismissed as harmless.</p>
<p>The fear that has been entertained that infected insects may be<lb/>
imported in boxes or trunks we believe to be absolutely groundless,<lb/>
and this for the simple reason, as shown by numerous observations<lb/>
made by us, that <hi>mosquitoes, when deprived of water, die within a<lb/>
few days</hi>. Even if allowed to fill themselves with blood immediately<lb/>
before the experiment is begun, and then deprived of water, practi-<lb/>
cally all are dead by the expiration of the fifth or commencement of<lb/>
the sixth day. We may say that of a large number of insects tried<lb/>
in this way only one female has survived until the sixth day, and<lb/>
then in a feeble condition. Males and females which have been living<lb/>
on sugar and water, or fed two days before on blood, if deprived of<lb/>
water and food, begin to die after 24 hours, and all are dead on the<lb/>
fourth morning. Free access to water, therefore, is necessary for the<lb/>
existence of this mosquito.</p>
<p>Add to the deprivation of water the chances of injury to so frail<lb/>
an insect packed in with articles of clothing, etc., and we see that<lb/>
infected mosquitoes can not be imported alive in baggage that has<lb/>
been five days en route.</p>
<p>As the first special measure of prevention, then, we should give<lb/>
our prompt attention to <hi>the protection of the sick individual against<lb/>
the bites of mosquitoes</hi>. This can best be accomplished by thorough<lb/>
screening, without delay, of the windows and doors of the room<lb/>
occupied by the patient and with as little disturbance as possible, so<lb/>
that any insects already present in the room may be prevented from<lb/>
escaping. As it will not be feasible to make use of any of the<lb/>
destructive agents against mosquitoes already within the patient's<lb/>
room until recovery, every precaution should be used to see that the<lb/>
insects do not escape in opening and closing the door. Screens at<lb/>
windows should not, for this reason, be movable. As it is possible<lb/>
that mosquitoes that have already bitten the sick individual may<lb/>
have escaped into other apartments of the house, these should be<lb/>
closed tightly and subjected either to sulphur or to formaldehyde<lb/>
disinfection or to the fumes of burning pyrethrum. According to<lb/>
Dr. Gorgas, the efficient health officer of Habana, preference is given<lb/>
to pyrethrum powder, burned in the proportion of 1 pound to 1,000<lb/>
cubic feet of air space.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> He, however, adds:</p>
<p>As the pyrethrum powder, even in this large quantity, does not certainly kill all<lb/>
mosquitoes, the room is opened at the end of three hours and the mosquitoes on the<lb/>
floor swept up and burned.</p>

cubic feet of air space, will suffice effectually to destroy all mosquitoes.<lb/>
Formaldehyde gas is not quite so efficient. With Trenner's formal-<lb/>
dehyde generator, charged with formalin, 900 c.c.; glycerin, 9 c.c.;<lb/>
methyl alcohol, 360 c.c., which we have found quite reliable for the<lb/>
destruction of bacteria, an exposure of not less than three and pref-<lb/>
erably four hours is required in order to kill these insects in a tight<lb/>
room having 2,800 cubic feet capacity. Pyrethrum powder, if<lb/>
burned in the proportion of 4 ounces to 1,000 cubic feet of air space,<lb/>
will stupefy all mosquitoes at the expiration of one hour, so that<lb/>
they will fall to the floor in a helpless condition. If used, however,<lb/>
the precaution above recommended by Dr. Gorgas should be strictly<lb/>
followed--<hi>that is, the room should be opened at the end of three<lb/>
hours and all insects carefully swept up and burned. The practice<lb/>
of destroying all mosquitoes in adjoining houses, as carried out in<lb/>
the city of Habana with such excellent results, we consider of the<lb/>
greatest importance, since</hi> only in this way can we hope to destroy<lb/>
infected mosquitoes, and thus prevent the occurrence of secondary<lb/>
cases. In other words, relying upon the well-known slow progress of<lb/>
the spread of yellow fever, we seek to catch and destroy all mosqui-<lb/>
toes within a given radius of the first case. If secondary cases should<lb/>
occur, the same hygienic measures should be rigorously enforced<lb/>
along the lines above indicated. Upon the completion of the case,<lb/>
the room occupied by the patient should be disinfected, and in a<lb/>
matter where so much is at stake we believe that sulphur should be<lb/>
given the preference as a disinfectant. In case of death, the body<lb/>
should be carefully screened against mosquitoes, as stegomyia will<lb/>
bite the dead body and might in this way acquire the parasite.</p>
<p>We have said nothing about the protection of nonimmune individ-<lb/>
uals who enter the patient's room or house, since, if the case under<lb/>
consideration is the infecting case, no danger is incurred. As the<lb/>
duration of the attack is short, generally less than 10 days, the pa-<lb/>
tient's room will have been disinfected and the infected mosquitoes<lb/>
destroyed before they have become susceptible of conveying the dis-<lb/>
ease to others. We desire to emphasize the fact that the interval<lb/>
elapsing between the infection of this mosquito by biting a case of<lb/>
yellow fever and the time when it has become capable of conveying<lb/>
the disease, viz, about 12 days, is of the utmost importance in our<lb/>
efforts toward stamping out yellow fever at its very commencement,<lb/>
since it furnishes a nondangerous interval during which all infected<lb/>
insects should be easily destroyed. It thus makes the control of<lb/>
yellow fever hereafter a simpler and more certain matter than the<lb/>
suppression of an outbreak of any of the other acute infectious<lb/>
diseases. If nonimmunes entering an infected house desire protec-<lb/>
tion against the bites of stegomyia, this may be obtained by rubbing<lb/>
all exposed surfaces of the body, including the ankle surfaces, with<lb/>
spirits of camphor, oil of pennyroyal, or a 5 per cent menthol oint-<lb/>
ment. The protective effect of these substances is, however, only<lb/>
temporary.</p>
<p>What we have already said concerning the breeding places of<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi> should sufficiently indicate the general hygienic<lb/>
measures that should be taken in order to prevent the spread of yellow<lb/>
fever. These should consist in enforcing such measures as will effec-<lb/>
tually destroy the breeding places of this very domestic mosquito.<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
The methods adopted by the chief sanitary officer of Habana, during<lb/>
the present year, may be taken as a model by our sanitary officials.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>.<lb/>
It should not be forgotten that a well-drained and well-sewered city,<lb/>
with a pure water supply and clean streets, has no protection against<lb/>
the spread of yellow fever, provided rain-water barrels and other col-<lb/>
lections of water are present, in which stegomyia may breed. <hi>In one<lb/>
of the forts, on the outskirts of Habana, which was otherwise</hi> in an<lb/>
excellent sanitary condition, we found thousands of <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi><lb/>
breeding in tin cans placed about the legs of a table in an officer's<lb/>
kitchen. Our conception of yellow fever, therefore, as a &ldquo;filth&rdquo; dis-<lb/>
ease must be abandoned, and our attention turned to yellow fever<lb/>
as a mosquito-borne disease. In illustration of what may be accom-<lb/>
plished by sanitation based on the latter method of propagation, we<lb/>
present herewith a chart (fig. 10) showing the actual monthly mor-<lb/>
tality from yellow fever in Habana, for the period from 1880 to 1899,<lb/>
and also for the years 1900 and 1901. Comparing the mortality from<lb/>
this disease for 1899, which was the most favorable year for yellow<lb/>
fever that Habana had experienced in 20 years, with 1901, during<lb/>
which sanitation, based on the demonstration that yellow fever is<lb/>
propagated by the mosquito, has been enforced, we find a reduction<lb/>
in mortality of 83.3 per cent in favor of the present epidemic year<lb/>
(Apr. 1 to Aug. 31); or if we compare the mortality for the epidemic<lb/>
year 1900 with the present year we observe a still greater reduction<lb/>
in favor of the latter, viz, 411 per cent.</p>
<p>The sanitary regulations put into force <hi>February 15, 1901, by</hi><lb/>
Dr. Gorgas, resulted in freeing Habana from yellow fever within 3<lb/>
months, so that for a period of 54 days--May 7 to July 1--no case<lb/>
occurred. On the latter date, the disease was brought into Habana<lb/>
from Santiago de las Vegas, and, according to Gorgas, has been intro-<lb/>
duced into the city at least a dozen times from this and other sources.<lb/>
In spite of these new sources of infection, July has only furnished<lb/>
four cases, with one death, and August eight cases, with two deaths.<lb/>
If such admirable results, under new methods of sanitation, have been<lb/>
obtained in this hotbed of yellow fever, we can not believe that the<lb/>
intelligent and efficient boards of health of our cities will again permit<lb/>
this disease to assume an epidemic form in any city of the United<lb/>
States.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Measures directed against the importation of yellow fever into the<lb/>
United States</hi>.--Under the admirable system of inspection and reports,<lb/>
as carried out by the Marine Hospital Service, the appearance of yel-<lb/>
low fever at any foreign port is promptly reported for the information<lb/>
of the health authorities of our several Atlantic ports. We may,<lb/>
therefore, divide foreign ports within the so-called epidemic zone<lb/>
into (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) infected, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) noninfected ports. Heretofore, no distinc-<lb/>
tion has been made by the health officers of our southern ports as<lb/>
regards quarantine regulations from April 1 to November 1, between<lb/>
infected and noninfected places. All ports within the epidemic zone<lb/>
of yellow fever were considered as being infected places, and hence pas-<lb/>
sengers and vessels were subjected to quarantine and to disinfection<lb/>
of both baggage and cargoes.</p>
<p>With our present knowledge of the way in which yellow fever is<lb/>
propagated, we believe that in the treatment of passengers, as well</p>

as of cargoes, a sharp distinction should be made, first, between<lb/>
infected and noninfected ports; and, secondly, in the case of vessels<lb/>
sailing from infected ports, between those that have received their<lb/>
cargoes and passengers in midstream and those that have loaded at<lb/>
the wharf.</p>

<p>We believe that no quarantine restrictions should be placed upon<lb/>
either passengers or cargo from noninfected ports. In the case of a<lb/>
vessel loading in midstream at an infected port by means of lighters,<lb/>
we believe that she can only receive infection in one way, i. e., by<lb/>

passengers who have been exposed to yellow fever on shore, and who,<lb/>
coming aboard, may thereafter be seized with the disease. The possi-<lb/>
bility of infected mosquitoes reaching the vessel, either by flight or<lb/>
by means of lighters, may be considered as highly improbable.</p>
<p>Vessels, loaded under the foregoing circumstances (i.e., by lighters<lb/>
in midstream), and arriving at our ports without yellow fever devel-<lb/>
oped en route should have their nonimmune passengers quarantined<lb/>
for five days, counting the time consumed by the voyage as part of the<lb/>
quarantine period, and should be allowed to discharge their cargoes<lb/>
without delay. If the disease has developed en route among crew<lb/>
or passengers, the sick should be promptly removed; the forecastle<lb/>
or staterooms, as the case may be, thoroughly disinfected with sul-<lb/>
phur or formaldehyde gas, and the vessel allowed to proceed to her<lb/>
wharf.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the vessel has received her cargo at the wharf<lb/>
of an infected port, there is a possibility that she may have received<lb/>
infection in three ways: First, either by contaminated mosquitoes<lb/>
that have bitten a case of yellow fever in the immediate vicinity on<lb/>
shore; secondly, by mosquitoes that have become infected from bit-<lb/>
ing a yellow-fever patient present on another vessel loading at the<lb/>
same, or at an adjacent, wharf; or, thirdly, by some individual who<lb/>
has acquired the infection on shore and afterwards taken passage on<lb/>
the vessel.</p>
<p>In our opinion, however, the chances of infection of a vessel by<lb/>
contaminated mosquitoes coming aboard from a house or ship in<lb/>
close proximity are very slight; although such a possibility must be<lb/>
admitted, and the further possibility that recently infected mosquitoes<lb/>
may have sought refuge on the vessel during the night preceding her<lb/>
day of departure. It is also possible that a case of mild and hence<lb/>
undetected yellow fever may occur on board, and be the source for<lb/>
the infection of mosquitoes already present in the vessel.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, if a sufficient number of days have not<lb/>
elapsed between her port of departure and port of arrival in the United<lb/>
States, i. e., 16 to 21 days, to demonstrate the presence of infected<lb/>
mosquitoes by the occurrence of a case or cases of yellow fever en<lb/>
route, we know of no way of absolutely excluding the possibility of<lb/>
importation of the disease by such a vessel than by the detention of<lb/>
all nonimmune passengers for such number of days as will show their<lb/>
freedom from infection, and by careful disinfection of crew's and<lb/>
passengers' quarters.</p>
<p>If more than 20 days have elapsed during the voyage, without the<lb/>
occurrence of yellow fever, we see no good reason why either passen-<lb/>
gers or vessel should be detained.</p>
<p>We have said nothing about the disinfection of the vessel's cargo,<lb/>
for the reason that we do not consider this to be necessary. The only<lb/>
possible excuse for subjecting the cargo to disinfection would be the<lb/>
fear of the presence of infected mosquitoes in the vessel's hold, pro-<lb/>
vided she had loaded at the wharf of an infected port. In this<lb/>
instance, if the voyage has consumed five or more days, all mosqui-<lb/>
toes contained in the hold will have died; for, as we have already<lb/>
pointed out, <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi> lives only a few days if deprived of<lb/>
water. We can not too strongly insist that the danger of importation<lb/>
of yellow fever into the United States lies, not in cargo or personal</p>

baggage, but in the individual sick with that disease. With our<lb/>
present knowledge of its propagation, personal baggage should no<lb/>
longer be subjected to disinfection, and, with our increased ability to<lb/>
prevent its spread by measures easy of application, instances should<lb/>
be few and exceptional when a vessel coming from a yellow-fever port<lb/>
should be delayed longer than will be necessary to remove her non-<lb/>
immune passengers who have not yet completed their period of five<lb/>
days since leaving the port of departure.</p>
<p>The chief duty of quarantine officers hereafter will consist in the<lb/>
detection of mild or very mild cases of yellow fever. In a series of<lb/>
12 cases of experimental yellow fever produced by the bite of <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia<lb/>
fasciata</hi>, we have, elsewhere,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> pointed out that 4, or 33 per cent,<lb/>
were mild or very mild in character, and have indicated the difficulty<lb/>
of making a positive diagnosis in such cases.</p>
<p>In discussing the period of incubation of experimental yellow fever,<lb/>
we have shown that in 16.6 per cent of our cases the period of incu-<lb/>
bation exceeded the usual quarantine period of five days. If we add<lb/>
Carter's cases to those observed by ourselves, we find that of 24 cases<lb/>
the period of incubation exceeded five days in 3, or 12.5 per cent.</p>
<p>We can thus readily see what great danger heretofore lay in the<lb/>
passage through quarantine of just such mild cases, or of those having<lb/>
an incubation stage of more than five days.</p>
<p>While the exclusion of such cases is of the greatest importance, we<lb/>
doubt whether, with our improved knowledge of how to prevent the<lb/>
spread of yellow fever, it would be advisable to place a greater burden<lb/>
upon ships' passengers by extending the quarantine period to more<lb/>
than five days. It appears to us rather that in view of the trouble-<lb/>
some delays to which passengers and vessels from yellow-fever ports<lb/>
have been subjected in the past, the time has now arrived when,<lb/>
standing upon more solid ground, we will be justified in seeking in<lb/>
every way to lessen as much as possible the restrictions placed by<lb/>
present quarantine regulations upon the ship's cargo, while we add<lb/>
nothing to those of the passenger.</p>
<p>To this end a most important part will have been accomplished if<lb/>
we can persuade the sanitary authorities of our sister republic, Mexico,<lb/>
and of the Central and South American States, to join us in the adop-<lb/>
tion of more enlightened methods for the suppression of this widely<lb/>
prevalent epidemic.</p>

<head>THE ETIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER--A SUPPLEMENTAL NOTE.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></head>
<byline>By <docAuthor>WALTER REED</docAuthor>, M. D., Surgeon, United States Army, and JAMES CARROLL, M. D.,<lb/>
Contract Surgeon, United States Army, of Washington, D. C.</byline>
<p>In former contributions to this subject, we have shown by observa-<lb/>
tions made on human beings that yellow fever may be produced in<lb/>
the nonimmune individual either by the bite of the mosquito (1) (genus<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi>) that has previously been permitted to fill itself with the<lb/>
blood of a patient suffering with yellow fever, during the first three<lb/>
days of the attack, or by the subcutaneous injection of a small quan-<lb/>
tity of blood (2) (0.5 to 2 c. c.) drawn from the general circulation<lb/>
of such a patient during the active stage of this disease. For further<lb/>
particulars regarding these observations the reader is referred to the<lb/>
original papers.</p>
<p>Although these experiments have demonstrated that the specific<lb/>
agent of yellow fever is present in the blood, we may say that the<lb/>
prolonged microscopic search which has been made by other investi-<lb/>
gators, as well as by ourselves, both with fresh and stained prepara-<lb/>
tions of blood, taken at various stages of this disease and during early<lb/>
convalescence, <hi>has proved thus far entirely negative</hi>. We may<lb/>
add that the efforts which we have made with reasonable hope of<lb/>
reward, both in the bodies of infected mosquitoes, dissected in the<lb/>
fresh state, as well as by serial sections of the hardened insect, have<lb/>
likewise given no results which we consider worthy of record at the<lb/>
present time. Leaving out of consideration, therefore, for the time<lb/>
being, the further microscopic search for the specific agent in the<lb/>
blood of the sick and in the bodies of infected mosquitoes, we desire<lb/>
to call attention to some additional observations bearing on the<lb/>
etiology of the disease, <hi>which one of us (Carroll) has recently made<lb/>
at Las Animas Hospital, Habana, Cuba, and at Columbia Barracks,<lb/>
near Quemados, Cuba</hi>.</p>
<p>We here desire to express our sincere thanks to Dr. William H. Welch,<lb/>
of the Johns Hopkins University, who, during the past summer,<lb/>
kindly called our attention to the important observations which have<lb/>
been carried out in late years by Loeffler and Frosch relative to the<lb/>
etiology and prevention of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle. In the<lb/>
course of their investigations concerning a reliable method of immu-<lb/>
nization in this disease, the authors had occasion to dilute and after-<lb/>
wards to pass several times through a porcelain filter, lymph which<lb/>
had been collected from the blebs present in the mouth and on the<lb/>
feet of cattle sick with foot-and-mouth disease (4).</p>
<p>These observers, having already ascertained that immunity could<lb/>
be conferred upon cattle by the subcutaneous or intravenous injec-<lb/>
tion of one-fortieth to one-fiftieth c. c. of pure lymph previously</p>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
mixed with 1 c. c. of the defibrinated blood of an animal that had<lb/>
recently recovered from the disease, desired to find out whether the<lb/>
injection into calves of given quantities of this filtered and bacteria-<lb/>
free lymph would not, also, enable them to confer immunity of,<lb/>
perhaps, a higher degree upon cattle.</p>
<p>The results were quite surprising, since it was shown that calves<lb/>
which had received one-tenth to one-fortieth c. c. of the diluted and<lb/>
filtered lymph developed foot-and-mouth disease just as promptly<lb/>
as calves that had been injected with corresponding quantities of the<lb/>
unfiltered lymph.</p>
<p>According to Loeffler and Frosch, there were two possible explana-<lb/>
tions of this remarkable result; either that the filtered lymph held in<lb/>
solution an extraordinary active toxin, or that the specific agent of<lb/>
the disease was so minute as to pass through the pores of a filter<lb/>
which prevents the passage of the smallest known bacteria.</p>
<p>The authors accept the latter explanation, since they were able,<lb/>
in later experiments (4), by means of the filtered lymph, to convey the<lb/>
disease through a series of six animals, the last of which sickened<lb/>
just as promptly after the injection of the filtered lymph as the first<lb/>
of the series.</p>
<p>Having, therefore, conclusively determined that the microorganism<lb/>
of foot-and-mouth disease of cattle is so extremely minute as to pass<lb/>
readily through a porcelain filter, it was natural that Loeffler and<lb/>
Frosch should have put forward the suggestion that, perhaps, the<lb/>
specific agent of some of the acute infectious diseases of man and<lb/>
animals, such as smallpox, scarlet fever, measles, rinderpest, etc.,<lb/>
might also belong to this group of ultramicroscopic organisms.</p>
<p>It was for the purpose of ascertaining whether observations con-<lb/>
ducted along the same lines as those above mentioned might throw<lb/>
additional light upon the etiology of yellow fever that the following<lb/>
experiments were undertaken.</p>
<p>Of course it will be thoroughly appreciated that <hi>in experimentation<lb/>
on human beings, aside from the grave sense of responsibility, at<lb/>
times well-nigh insupportable, which the conscientious observer must<lb/>
always feel, even with the full consent of the subjects to be experi-<lb/>
mented upon</hi>, there must be added another factor, viz, the difficulty<lb/>
of finding willing and suitable nonimmune individuals for experimen-<lb/>
tation just at the proper and urgent moment. It so happened that,<lb/>
<hi>on the day of Dr. Carroll's arrival at Habana, August 11, 1901, the first<lb/>
patient of the series of seven cases of yellow fever which Dr. Guit&eacute;ras (5)<lb/>
had produced by bites of infected mosquitoes, was taken sick. The<lb/>
fatal termination of three of these cases produced a somewhat panicky<lb/>
feeling toward experimental yellow fever among the nonimmunes</hi> at<lb/>
Habana, which feeling was intensified by <hi>the sensational and distorted<lb/>
statements in one of the local Spanish papers</hi>. It was, therefore,<lb/>
extremely difficult--in fact, practically impossible--to obtain for<lb/>
inoculation purposes persons who could with reasonable certainty be<lb/>
regarded as nonimmunes.</p>
<p>Further, as it was not practicable to withdraw blood from any case<lb/>
of yellow fever under treatment in the city of Habana, it became<lb/>
necessary to produce cases by means of the bites of infected mos-<lb/>
quitoes--<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi>--accepting such subjects as were willing<lb/>
to submit to this mode of inoculation. In all six individuals, sup-<lb/>
posedly nonimmunes, were bitten by mosquitoes, of whom four gave<lb/>
a negative and two a positive result.</p>

<p>The following are the negative cases:</p>

by two insects that had been applied to a yellow fever patient 34 days previously.<lb/>

<hi>infected an individual, who later died of yellow fever</hi>.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">September 5, 1901</hi>.--J. T., American, was bitten by nine insects that had been ap-<lb/>

He was <hi>again bitten 30 days</hi> later by four mosquitoes that had been applied to a mod-<lb/>
erately severe case of experimental yellow fever 11 days before. The result of both<lb/>
inoculations were negative. This man had resided one year in Central America, and<lb/>
we were afterwards informed that he had confessed to a previous attack of the disease.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">September 11, 1901</hi>.--A. P., Spaniard, was bitten by three insects which 53 days<lb/>
previously had bitten patient with a typical case, on the third day of the attack.<lb/>
These were among a lot of mosquitoes that had already infected three individuals,<lb/>
two of whom died of yellow fever. The result was negative. <hi>Five weeks later</hi> he<lb/>
received a subcutaneous injection of about one-fourth c. c. of blood drawn from a<lb/>
patient with a mild case of yellow fever, on the second day of illness. Result negative.<lb/>
The previous history of this man was not satisfactory, as he had recently returned from<lb/>
a residence in Mexico.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">September 9, 1901</hi>.--A. V., Spaniard, was bitten by three mosquitoes that had been<lb/>
applied to a mild case of yellow fever on the second day of the attack, 27 days before.<lb/>
<hi>Three weeks later</hi> he was again bitten by one mosquito 49 days after it had been ap-<lb/>

both inoculations was negative.</p>
<p>We give brief sketches of the two positive cases:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case I</hi>.--P. R. C., a Spaniard, had served in the Spanish army in the Philippines.<lb/>
He arrived in Habana from Spain about August 30.</p>
<p>On <hi>September 16, 1901</hi>, he was bitten at 4 p. m. by 4 mosquitoes that had previ-<lb/>
ously fed upon cases of yellow fever as follows: One had bitten a patient having a<lb/>
fatal case, on the third day of the disease, 53 days before, and 3 had bitten a patient<lb/>
having a fatal case, on the second day of illness, 34 days previously. His attack<lb/>
began at 4.30 p. m., <hi>September 19</hi>, after an incubation period of 72 1&sol;2 hours. At the<lb/>
onset he experienced a slight chill with rigors and loss of appetite. Later in the<lb/>
evening he complained of slight frontal headache and pains in the lumbar region.<lb/>
On the following day the headache and backache were more severe. At 10 a. m. he<lb/>
vomited about 6 drams of slightly greenish fluid containing mucus. On the second<lb/>
day of the attack the gums were swollen, pale, and spongy, and there was soreness<lb/>
upon deep pressure over the epigastric and hypogastric regions; the face was flushed<lb/>
and the eyeballs were slightly yellow. September 24, fifth day, he was well jaun-<lb/>
diced, epigastric and abdominal soreness were pronounced, and there was nausea<lb/>
with eructations. At this time an unfavorable prognosis was given by two physi-<lb/>
cians of large experience in yellow fever. Happily, with the decline of temperature<lb/>
on the sixth day, the symptoms were much ameliorated and the patient made an un-<lb/>
interrupted recovery. Albumin appeared in the urine on the third day and persisted<lb/>
for 17 days. The microscope showed the presence of bile-stained epithelial and<lb/>
granular casts on the third and subsequent days.</p>
<p>Early on the second day blood was drawn from the median-basilic vein with all<lb/>
precaution and 10 drops were immediately added to each of four flasks containing<lb/>
200 c. c. of sterile nutritive bouillon. The flasks were kept under observation in the<lb/>
incubator and at room temperature for 14 days without the development of any growth.<lb/>
At the end of that time each flask was agitated and an agar slant was freely inoculated<lb/>
with fibrin and fluid from its contents. These cultures remained sterile 16 days<lb/>
later after being kept four days in the incubator and 12 at room temperature.</p>
<p>On the second day, blood was drawn for the purpose of obtaining serum for filtration,<lb/>
but <hi rend="italic">owing to an accident to the vacuum pump the experiment had to be abandoned</hi>.</p>
<p>Specimens of the fresh blood were examined for malarial parasites, with negative<lb/>
results, on the second and fourth days of the attack. (Chart I.)</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case II</hi>.--J. M. A., Spaniard, recently landed at Havana, was bitten at 4 p. m.<lb/>
October 9, by 8 mosquitoes that had been applied to a severe case of yellow fever<lb/>
(Case I) on the second day of the disease, 18 days previously. The attack which fol-<lb/>
lowed was mild. According to his own account, he went to bed on the evening of<lb/>
the 12th feeling in perfect health. He awakened about midnight with frontal<lb/>
headache, but had no chill. <hi>October 13</hi>, 7 a. m., temperature was 102.2&deg; F., pulse<lb/>
92; complained of pain in the head and back; later in the day there was marked<lb/>

<p>ties. The eyes were injected moderately and the gums slightly so. On the follow-<lb/>
ing day, October 14, the frontal headache was more severe, there was considerable<lb/>
soreness on pressure over the stomach and abdomen, and he complained of sharp<lb/>
lumbar pain. An examination of the fresh blood proved negative for malarial para-<lb/>
sites. At 4 p. m. blood was drawn from a vein at the bend of the elbow and 10 drops<lb/>
were inoculated into each of 2 flasks containing 200 c. c. of sterile bouillon. One<lb/>
flask remained sterile, the other developed a growth which proved to be a white<lb/>
staphylococcus.</p>
<p>October 15 the gums were pale, swollen and spongy, their margins distinctly red-<lb/>
dened, and blood could be easily pressed out from beneath the lower gums.</p>
<p>October 16 there was free oozing of blood from the gums and margin of the tongue.<lb/>
The case pursued a mild course, the temperature falling to normal at 9 p. m. of the<lb/>
fourth day. A trace of albumin was present in the urine passed on the morning of that<lb/>
day, and for a few days following hyalin and granular casts were found. The patient<lb/>
made a speedy recovery. (Chart II.)</p>
<p>On October 15, 11.30 a. m., at the beginning of the third day of illness, the tempera-<lb/>
ture was 101&deg; F.; 65 c. c. of blood were drawn, with antiseptic precautions, from a vein<lb/>
at the bend of the elbow. This was placed in a sterile test tube and set aside in the<lb/>
refrigerator. At 6 a. m., 5 1&sol;2 hours later, 19 c. c. of a slightly bloodstained serum were<lb/>
pipetted off into another sterile tube. After the addition of an equal quantity of<lb/>
sterilized distilled water the diluted serum was slowly filtered through a new Berke-<lb/>
feld laboratory filter that had been subjected to previous sterilization in an Arnold's<lb/>
sterilizer. In this way 35 c. c. of a slightly bloodstained filtrate were obtained, a part<lb/>
of which was subsequently used for the inoculation of Cases VII, VII, and IX of this<lb/>
report.</p>
<p>The original level of the blood having been marked upon the tube into which it<lb/>
was drawn, a sufficient quantity of sterilized distilled water was then added to replace<lb/>
the 19 c. c. of serum that had been pipetted off and to make up the original volume of<lb/>
blood. The whole, consisting of clot, remaining serum, and distilled water, was<lb/>
poured into a sterile vessel and whipped up with a sterilized egg beater. The mix-<lb/>
ture, which approximately represented the partially defibrinated blood, was then<lb/>
divided into two parts, one of which was reserved for the inoculation of a control sub-<lb/>
ject (Case III), while the other part was placed in a double water bath previously<lb/>
heated, and exposed to a temperature of 55&deg; C. for 10 minutes. It was then removed<lb/>
and immediately cooled in ice water. This cooled material was subsequently used for<lb/>
the injection of Cases IV, V, and VI.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that we have at our disposal, for purposes of<lb/>
inoculation, three kinds of materials, derived from the blood in Case<lb/>
II, viz: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The unheated and partially defibrinated blood; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the<lb/>
partially defibrinated blood which had been heated to a temperature<lb/>
of 55&deg; C. for 10 minutes, and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the diluted blood serum which had<lb/>
been filtered through a Berkefeld filter. Each of these materials<lb/>
was used for the inoculation of one-or more nonimmune individuals<lb/>
with the results that follow herewith.</p>
<p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) THE UNHEATED AND PARTIALLY DEFIBRINATED BLOOD.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case III</hi>.--M. G. M., Spaniard, arrived at Habana October 4, 1901. At 4 p. m.<lb/>
October 15 he was given a subcutaneous injection of 0.75 c. c. of the unheated and<lb/>
partially defibrinated blood obtained from Case II, 15 1&sol;2 hours previously, which had<lb/>
been kept 5 1&sol;2 hours in the refrigerator and 10 hours at room temperature. The earliest<lb/>
symptom, frontal headache, was complained of at 6 p. m., <hi>October 20</hi>, or at the expi-<lb/>
ration of 5 days and 2 hours after inoculation. Temperature 100.6&deg; F., pulse 80. At<lb/>
3 p. m. of the same day the temperature was 98.4&deg; F., pulse 80. At that time the<lb/>
patient did not complain of any discomfort and there was nothing to indicate that he<lb/>
was about to be taken sick. <hi>October 21</hi>, 5 p. m., nearly 24 hours from the onset, there<lb/>
was flushing of the face, injection of the eyes and gums, and moderately severe head-<lb/>
ache; pain in the back, and tenderness on pressure in the epigastric region made the<lb/>
picture complete. On the third day the face was deeply flushed, eyes congested<lb/>
and distinctly yellow. There was slight oozing of blood from the gums. The urine<lb/>
passed at 7.30 p. m. contained a distinct trace of albumin. The case was seen by the<lb/>
Habana Board of Yellow Fever Experts and the diagnosis confirmed. The patient<lb/>
passed through a mild but typical attack, the temperature touching normal on the<lb/>
fifth day. (Chart III.)</p>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>This case, therefore, serves as a &ldquo;control&rdquo; for the observations<lb/>
which are to follow, since it demonstrates that the blood drawn from<lb/>
the general circulation of case II, at the beginning of the third day,<lb/>
contained the specific agent of yellow fever, and, in this respect, con-<lb/>
firms the observations which have heretofore been reported by us (6).</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Case IV</hi>.--A. C., Spaniard, nonimmune, arrived at Habana, October 6, 1901. At<lb/>
4.35 p. m., October 15, he was given subcutaneously 1.5 c. c. of the partially defibri-<lb/>
nated blood which had been subjected to a temperature of 55&deg; C. during 10 minutes.<lb/>
The specimen had been drawn from case II, 16 hours before. The result of this injec-<lb/>
tion was entirely negative, as the subject remained in perfect health during the 10 days<lb/>
following.</p>

At 4.45 p. m., October 15, he received a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 c. c. of the same<lb/>
material that was used in case IV. Result negative.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case VI</hi>.--S. O., Spaniard, nonimmune, arrived at Habana, October 7, 1901. At<lb/>
4.50 p. m., October 15, he was given a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 c. c. of the same<lb/>
material that was used in cases IV and V. No rise of temperature or other symptoms<lb/>
of ill health followed this injection.</p>
<p><figure entity="S8220165"></figure> CHART III.--Yellow fever, produced by injection of 0.75 cc. of blood. Incubation, 5 days, 2 hours.</p>
<p>We desire to invite attention to the fact that <hi>the four subjects whose<lb/>
protocols have been given above were young Spaniards who arrived<lb/>
at Habana at a time when yellow fever was not present in the city;<lb/>
that they were carried from the quarantine camp, at Triscornia, across<lb/>
the bay, direct to Columbia Barracks, near Quemados</hi>, Cuba, where<lb/>
they were kept for seven full days prior to inoculation; and that after<lb/>
<pb n="156" id="S8220166"/>
156<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
inoculation they were kept under close daily observation for the<lb/>
further period of 10 days, during which time both temperature and<lb/>
pulse were recorded every third hour. Since under these circum-<lb/>
stances each of the three nonimmunes (cases IV, V, and VI) received,<lb/>
without any disturbance to health, double the quantity of heated and<lb/>
partially defibrinated blood that sufficed when unheated to cause an<lb/>
attack of yellow fever in case III, it follows that the specific agent<lb/>
present in the blood in yellow fever is destroyed, or, at least markedly<lb/>
attenuated, by a temperature of 55&deg; C. maintained for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) THE DILUTED AND FILTERED SERUM.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case VII</hi>.--P. H., American soldier, nonimmune, received at 11 a. m. October 15,<lb/>
1901, a subcutaneous injection of 3 c. c. of the serum filtrate, representing 1.5 c. c. of the<lb/>
undiluted serum 10 1&sol;2 hours after the blood had been drawn from Case II. He remained<lb/>
in good health until 3 p. m. October 19, an interval of four days and four hours, when<lb/>
his face appeared flushed and his eyes somewhat injected. His temperature at this<lb/>
time was 101&deg; F., his pulse 80. He did not complain of headache or other pain. From<lb/>
this hour his temperature declined, until at 12 o'clock midnight it registered 98&deg; F.,<lb/>
pulse 72. October 20, 9 a. m., temperature 100.8&deg; F., pulse 78. Face more suffused<lb/>
and slight headache complained of. Fever continued on the 21st, with more marked<lb/>
flushing of the face and injection of the eyes. The height of the primary febrile parox-<lb/>
ysm was reached at 6 p. m. October 21. Remission occurred at 9 a. m. October 22,<lb/>
when the temperature dropped to 98.8&deg; F., pulse 64. This lasted for 24 hours and<lb/>
was followed by a secondary febrile paroxysm of 42 hours' duration. On the 23d<lb/>
blood was oozing from the lower gums and the eyeballs were tinged with yellow.<lb/>
Albumin appeared in the urine on the fourth day. The patient was visited by the<lb/>
board of experts and the <hi>diagnosis of yellow fever confirmed</hi>. Examination of the<lb/>
dried blood for malarial parasites was negative. The patient recovered. (Chart IV.)</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case VIII</hi>.--A. W. C., American soldier, nonimmune, was also given at 11.05 a. m.<lb/>
October 15, 1901, a subcutaneous injection of 3 c. c. of the diluted and filtered serum,<lb/>
being the equivalent of 1.5 c. c. of the undiluted serum, 10 1&sol;2 hours after the blood had<lb/>
been drawn. He remained in his usual health until about noon, October 19, at which<lb/>
time he felt &ldquo;out of sorts&rdquo; and ate but little dinner. This was 4 days and 1 hour after<lb/>
the injection. During the afternoon he lay down and slept until 3 p. m., when he<lb/>
awoke with a severe headache and backache. His face was flushed. Temperature<lb/>
103.6&deg; F., pulse 102. At this hour his face and eyes were deeply congested, and from<lb/>
this time his symptoms were characteristic of the disease. On the 23d his eyes were<lb/>
quite yellow and general jaundice followed later. No albumin was found in this<lb/>
patient's urine. He was seen by the board of experts and his illness pronounced a<lb/>
<hi>typical case of yellow fever</hi>. Careful examination of the dried blood for malarial<lb/>
parasites was negative. The patient made a good recovery. (Chart V.)</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case IX</hi>.--J. R. B., American, nonimmune, at 2.30 p. m. October 15, 1901, was<lb/>
given a subcutaneous injection of 3 c. c. of the diluted and filtered serum, equal to<lb/>
1.5 c. c. of the undiluted serum. Fourteen hours had elapsed since the blood had<lb/>
been drawn from Case II.</p>
<p>This injection was followed by <hi>no symptoms</hi> of physical disturbance, until 3 p. m.<lb/>
October 19, an interval of four days and a half hour, when his temperature was 99.4&deg; F.,<lb/>
pulse 92. He complained of headache and flashes of heat, with slight pain between<lb/>
the shoulders, symptoms which, the subject stated, were quite unusual to him. At 9<lb/>
p. m. temperature 98.4&deg; F., pulse 84. There was <hi>no further febrile disturbance</hi> and<lb/>
the day following the subject was <hi>in his usual good health</hi>.</p>
<p>We thus observe that of 3 nonimmune individuals who received<lb/>
subcutaneously an injection of filtered blood serum derived from<lb/>
case II of this report, 2 developed an unmistakable attack of yellow<lb/>
fever, after a period of incubation of 98 1&sol;2 hours and 100 hours respec-<lb/>
tively, while in 1 case the result must be regarded as negative.</p>
<p>As already stated, the serum used for these inoculations had been<lb/>
slowly filtered through a new Berkefeld laboratory filter. As soon<lb/>
as possible thereafter the filter was resterilized by steam and thor-<lb/>
oughly tested as to its effectiveness in preventing the passage of<lb/>
bacteria. For this purpose a recent bouillon culture of <hi rend="italic">Staphylococcus<lb/>
<pb n="157" id="S8220167"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
157<lb/>
pyogenes aureus</hi> was used, of which 50 c. c. were passed through the<lb/>
filter. The filtrate thus obtained was transferred in quantities of<lb/>
10 c. c. to each of two flasks containing 200 c. c. of sterile bouillon, which<lb/>
were incubated at 37&deg; C. for 4 days and thereafter kept at room<lb/>
temperature for 10 days longer, at the end of which time no growth<lb/>
had occurred. It appears, therefore, that the filter used for the<lb/>
filtration of the blood serum in case II was to be relied upon for<lb/>
the delivery of a bacteria-free filtrate.</p>
<p>The production of yellow fever by the injection of blood serum<lb/>
that had previously been passed through a filter capable of removing<lb/>
all test of bacteria, is, we think, a matter of extreme interest and<lb/>
importance. The occurrence of the disease under such circumstances,<lb/>
and within the usual period of incubation, might be explained in<lb/>
one of two ways, viz, first, upon the supposition that the serum<lb/>
filtrate contains a toxin of considerable potency; or, secondly, that</p>
<p><figure entity="S8220167"></figure> CHART IV.--Yellow fever, produced by injection of 1.5 cc. of filtered blood-serum. Incubation, 4 days,<lb/>
4 hours.</p>
<p>the specific agent of yellow fever is of such minute size as to pass<lb/>
readily through the pores of a Berkefeld filter.</p>
<p>In favor of the supposition that in yellow fever an active toxin is<lb/>
present in the blood may be cited the early and well-marked jaun-<lb/>
dice; the free hemorrhage from the mucous membranes of the<lb/>
mouth and stomach, doubtless due to profound changes in capillary<lb/>
vessel walls; the rapid progress of the disease to a fatal termination,<lb/>
the advanced fatty degeneration of the hepatic cells, as well as the<lb/>
marked parenchymatous changes found in the kidneys. If present<lb/>
in the blood this toxin would in all likelihood be found in the serum<lb/>
filtrate obtained from the blood, and if injected in sufficient quantity<lb/>
might induce an attack of yellow fever in a susceptible individual<lb/>
after the usual period of incubation. In this respect it would bear<lb/>
analogy to the production of tetanus in the human being, after the<lb/>
usual period of incubation of this disease by the subcutaneous<lb/>
injection of a very small quantity of tetanus toxin, as reported<lb/>
by Nicolas (7) in 1893, and more recently by Bolton, Fisch, and<lb/>
Walden (8).</p>
<pb n="158" id="S8220168"/>
<p>158<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>Against the view that a toxin is present in the serum filtrate, we<lb/>
invite attention to the innocuousness of the partially defibrinated<lb/>
blood when heated to 55&deg; C. for 10 minutes, as shown by the negative<lb/>
results in cases IV, V, and VI. Here the toxin, which must have<lb/>
been present in just the same quantity as in the serum filtrate obtained<lb/>
from this blood, appears to have been completely destroyed by the<lb/>
temperature above mentioned. Now, although certain bacteria are<lb/>
destroyed by this temperature, as yet we know of no bacterial toxin<lb/>
that is rendered inert by such a low degree of heat continued for so<lb/>
short a time. The tetanus toxin, which has been found to be the<lb/>
most sensitive thus far requires, according to Kitasato, a tempera-<lb/>
ture of 60&deg; C. for 20 minutes, or 55&deg; C. for 1 1&sol;2 hours, in order to destroy<lb/>
its activity. (9)</p>
<p>As a further test and in order to determine whether the serum<lb/>
filtrate contained something more particulate than a soluble toxin,</p>
<p><figure entity="S8220168"></figure> CHART V.--Yellow fever, produced by injection of 1.5 cc. of filtered blood serum. Incubation, 4 days,<lb/>
1 hour.</p>
<p>we availed ourselves of the opportunity of observing the effect that<lb/>
would follow the transference to a third individual of blood drawn<lb/>
from one of the patients whose attack had been occasioned by the<lb/>
injection of 1.5 c. c. of serum filtrate (case VII). If under these<lb/>
circumstances it would be found that the injection of a small quantity<lb/>
of blood was followed by an attack of yellow fever in a third indi-<lb/>
vidual, the evidence would point in the strongest manner to the<lb/>
presence of the specific agent of the disease in such blood, since we<lb/>
can hardly believe that a toxin which had undergone so great a<lb/>
dilution in the body of the second individual would still be capable<lb/>
of producing the disease.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Case X</hi>.--October 22, 1901, 3 p. m., J. <del>M</del><add>R</add>. B., American, nonimmune, who on<lb/>
October 15, 1901, at 2.30 p. m., had been injected with 1.5 c. c. of serum filtrate with<lb/>
negative result (vide case IX), and who still desired to have his immunity further<lb/>
tested, was, at the beginning of this, the eighth day after his former inoculation, given<lb/>
<pb n="159" id="S8220169"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
159<lb/>
a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 c. c. of blood drawn from the venous circulation of<lb/>
case VII early in the fourth day of the disease. At the time of inoculation the subjects'<lb/>
condition was quite normal. October 23, 3 p. m., after an incubation period of just<lb/>
24 hours, he complained of frontal and slight basal headache and some pain between<lb/>
the shoulders. His temperature was 99.6&deg; F. and pulse 100. At 6 p. m., temperature<lb/>
100.4&deg;, pulse 100. Pain in the back quite severe. At 10.15 p. m., he suffered a slight<lb/>
chill. On the following morning the face was flushed and the eyes and gums injected;<lb/>
there was sharp frontal headache and some photophobia. The height of the primary<lb/>
paroxysm was reached at the end of 23 hours. Remission occurred at 9 a. m., October<lb/>
25, and was followed by a second febrile paroxysm of 45 hours' duration. On the<lb/>
third day, during the secondary fever, the patient presented the typical picture of a<lb/>
mild case of yellow fever; the face was deeply flushed, eyes well injected and slightly<lb/>
yellow; there was sharp headache, and epigastric tenderness and pain in the lower<lb/>
extremities. Heller's test showed albumin in the urine drawn on the fourth day.<lb/>
His fever subsided on the later day and he made a prompt recovery. The case was<lb/>
seen by the board of experts and the diagnosis confirmed. (<hi>Chart VI</hi>.)</p>
<p>In considering this individual's attack, his infection must be<lb/>
attributed either to the injection of the serum filtrate derived from<lb/>
case II, in which event the onset of his disease was postponed until the<lb/>
commencement of the ninth day after inoculation, or to the injection</p>
<p><figure entity="S8220169"></figure> CHART <del>IV</del><add>VI</add>.--Yellow fever, produced by injection of 1.5 cc. of blood. Incubation, 24 hours.</p>
<p>of blood obtained from case VII, after a period of incubation of 24<lb/>
hours.</p>
<p>In our own experience (10) and that of Guit&eacute;ras (11) of 22 cases<lb/>
of experimental yellow fever, following the bite of the mosquito,<lb/>
in which the period of incubation was definitely and accurately<lb/>
ascertained, the longest period was 6 days and 1 hour, and the shortest<lb/>
period 2 days and 13 hours. If we take the cases produced by the<lb/>
injection of blood, 7 in number, exclusive of the case under considera-<lb/>
tion, the longest period was 5 days and 2 hours (case III of this<lb/>
report) and the shortest 41 hours.</p>
<p>In view of these data, we believe we are justified in expressing<lb/>
the opinion that the source of infection in case X must be attributed<lb/>
to the injection of blood drawn from case VII, rather than to the<lb/>
injection of the filtered serum derived from the blood in case II; and<lb/>
further, that the blood in case VII contained the specific agent of<lb/>
yellow fever, which had, therefore, passed through the filter along<lb/>
with the filtrate with which this latter individual had been inoculated.</p>
<p>The important questions which naturally arise from the foregoing<lb/>
experiments must be left for the future observations to determine.</p>

<p>[From The Journal of Hygiene, Vol. II, No. 2, April, 1902.]</p>
<p>The efficient control of the spread of yellow fever is a matter of<lb/>
such vast practical importance, both from the hygienic and com-<lb/>
mercial point of view--not only for the countries where this disease<lb/>
prevails as an epidemic, but also for those in which, after importa-<lb/>
tion, it may assume epidemic proportions--that it has seemed appro-<lb/>
priate to bring together in this paper a summary of the work thus<lb/>
far accomplished by the United States Army Commission<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> on the<lb/>
island of Cuba, during the years 1900 and 1901, in order that English<lb/>
and Colonial readers who have not, perhaps, had access to the<lb/>
original contributions published in different American journals, may<lb/>
be able to form an intelligent opinion concerning the permanent value<lb/>
of this work. It will also afford opportunity for recording the more<lb/>
recent confirmatory observations made by others concerning the mode<lb/>
of transmission of yellow fever discovered by the commission, and<lb/>
for calling attention to the results already obtained by the United<lb/>
States Army Medical Department in the suppression of this disease,<lb/>
especially in the city of Habana, through the enforcement of sanitary<lb/>
measures based on these later researches.</p>
<p><hi>The American commission was organized in May, 1900</hi>, and began<lb/>
its investigations during the following month (June), being equipped<lb/>
with suitable laboratory facilities for practical work, both at the<lb/>
military garrison of Columbia Barracks, near Quemados, Cuba, and<lb/>
also in the city of Habana. As yellow fever was already prevailing<lb/>
at the time of our arrival in Cuba suitable material for the scientific<lb/>
study of this disease was immediately available.</p>
<p>THE ETIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>Before giving the results of our investigations it may be well to<lb/>
recall the situation as regards the etiology of yellow fever at that<lb/>
time. Briefly it may be said that the claims of all investigators for<lb/>
the discovery of the specific agent of yellow fever--since modern<lb/>
bacteriological methods had come into use--had been disproved by<lb/>
the exhaustive observations of Sternberg (1), published in 1890, ex-<lb/>
cept that made by Sanarelli (2) for a small, motile bacillus isolated<lb/>
by him from the blood drawn during life in 2 of 6 cases of yellow<lb/>
fever, and from the blood and organs after death in 7 of 12<lb/>
cases of this disease (58 per cent), studied at Montevideo and Rio de</p>

<p>Janeiro, Brazil. The results obtained, however, by those who had<lb/>
promptly undertaken to investigate Sanarelli's claim for the specific<lb/>
character of <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi>, seemed to show a lack of agreement<lb/>
such as has never been reported, as far as the writer can recall, in<lb/>
connection with the supposed specific cause of any of the other acute<lb/>
infections. Thus while <hi>Achinard and Woodson (3) had, during the</hi><lb/>
epidemic of 1897 in New Orleans, La., isolated a bacillus, claimed by<lb/>
them to be identical with <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>, from the venous blood in 4<lb/>
out of 5 cases, and from yellow fever cadavers in 32 out of 39<lb/>
cases (82 per cent), <hi>Portier (4)</hi>, working in the same city and during<lb/>
the same epidemic, could only obtain this bacillus 3 times in<lb/>
51 autopsies, and failed to obtain it at all in cultures made from<lb/>
the venous blood during life in 10 cases. <hi>Again, while Wasdin and<lb/>
Geddings (5), in the city of Habana, were able</hi> to cultivate <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi><lb/>
from blood withdrawn from the lobe of the ear, &ldquo;not earlier than the<lb/>
third day of the disease&rdquo; in 13 of 14 cases (92.8 per cent), and to<lb/>
find it in 85.7 per cent of their necropsies, <hi>Agramonte (6), studying<lb/>
the disease on the island of Cuba</hi>, failed to isolate <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> in a<lb/>
single instance from blood drawn from the lobe of the ear in 37 cases<lb/>
or from the blood drawn from a vein at the bend of the elbow in<lb/>
31 cases at various stages of the disease. The latter observer, how-<lb/>
ever, reported finding this bacillus at autopsy in 11 of 35 cases (31.4<lb/>
per cent). Without going further into detail, we may say that the<lb/>
results obtained by Lutz (7) and de Lacerda and Ramos (8) in Brazil,<lb/>
and by Matienzo (9) in Mexico, were equally conflicting and unsatis-<lb/>
factory.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances it <hi>seemed to the members of the com</hi>-<lb/>
mission <hi>of the first importance to give their entire attention to</hi> the<lb/>
bacteriological study of the blood of those sick with yellow fever and<lb/>
of the blood and organs of yellow-fever cadavers, having especially in<lb/>
view the isolation of <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>. We were thus able during June,<lb/>
July, and August to take repeated <hi>cultures from the blood</hi> during life<lb/>
<hi>in 18 cases of yellow fever</hi>, adopting the usual method employed in<lb/>
withdrawing blood from a vein at the bend of the elbow, and trans-<lb/>
ferring the blood at once, in quantities of 0.5 c. c., to each of several<lb/>
tubes containing 10 c. c. of nutritive bouillon which were afterwards<lb/>
incubated at 37&deg; C. for a period of one week. In 7 cases, 4 of which<lb/>
were designated as &ldquo;mild&rdquo; yellow fever and 3 as &ldquo;well-marked&rdquo;<lb/>
yellow fever, only 1 culture was made from the blood in each<lb/>
case, viz, in 2 cases on the first day; in 1 case on the second<lb/>
day; in 3 cases on the third day; and in 1 case on the fourth day.<lb/>
In the remaining 11 cases, diagnosed as &ldquo;severe&rdquo; yellow fever,<lb/>
of whom 4 died, more frequent cultures were taken from the blood,<lb/>
these varying from 2 to 6 cultures on as many different days of the<lb/>
disease. In 2 of the fatal cases cultures were made each day from the<lb/>
commencement of the attack and including the day on which death<lb/>
occurred.</p>
<p>The negative result of these numerous cultures taken from the<lb/>
blood of cases of yellow fever, as regards the presence of <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>,<lb/>
was reported in a &ldquo;Preliminary note&rdquo; presented at the meeting of the<lb/>
American Public Health Association (10), held in Indianapolis, Ind.,<lb/>
October 22-26, 1900. <hi>To these 18 cases we can now add 6 other<lb/>
cases, or a total of 24, from</hi> which blood cultures have been made<lb/>
during life with negative results.</p>
<pb n="163" id="S8220173"/>
<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
163</p>
<p>The importance of this negative finding as regards the growth of<lb/>
any specific bacterium will be better appreciated when it is seen, as I<lb/>
shall soon have occasion to point out, that yellow fever may be pro-<lb/>
duced in nonimmune human beings by the subcutaneous injection of<lb/>
a small quantity (0.5-2 c. c.) of blood withdrawn from the venous<lb/>
circulation of a patient suffering with this disease.</p>
<p>In addition to the results above recorded, the <hi>careful study of 11</hi><lb/>
autopsies was equally barren as to the presence of any particular<lb/>
micro-organism, although the quantity of material with which our<lb/>
tubes were inoculated was greater than is usually made use of at<lb/>
autopsies.</p>
<p>In a word, then, the careful bacteriological study which the com-<lb/>
mission had made in cases of yellow fever had given no indications<lb/>
as to the presence of the specific agent of this disease. The same may<lb/>
be said concerning the result of <hi>numerous microscopic examinations<lb/>
of fresh and stained specimens of blood which we had in the mean</hi>-<lb/>
while studied with a view of finding possibly some intracellular or<lb/>
extracellular body. Apparently no body, bacterial or protozoan,<lb/>
which could be brought into view <hi>with a one-twelfth Zeiss immersion<lb/>
objective, was present in the blood of these cases</hi>.</p>
<p>Although displaced from the order in which the following observa-<lb/>
tions were made, it will be best to present, at this time, the results of<lb/>
the experiments which were later carried out by the commission on<lb/>
nonimmune human beings by means of the subcutaneous injection of<lb/>
blood, withdrawn during the active stage of the disease, as these results<lb/>
bear so directly upon the subject which we are now considering, viz,<lb/>
the etiology of yellow fever.</p>
<p>The <hi>only reference that I can find in the literature relative to an<lb/>
attempt to convey yellow fever in this way is cited by Sternberg (11),<lb/>
who states that at Veracruz, Mexico, in 1887, he saw Dr. Ruis inject<lb/>
into a nonimmune individual a hypodermic syringeful of blood drawn</hi><lb/>
from a case of yellow fever on the <hi>eighth</hi> day of the disease. The<lb/>
result was negative, as was also the result of two other attempts<lb/>
related to him by Ruis.</p>
<p>Our own observations, undertaken for the purpose of ascertaining<lb/>
whether an attack of yellow fever could be induced in a second indi-<lb/>
vidual by the injection of a small quantity of blood, embrace experi-<lb/>
ments made on 12 American soldiers and Spanish immigrants, all<lb/>
nonimmune individuals.</p>
<p>These observations may be divided into the following classes:</p>
<p>(1) Injection of the fresh blood taken from a vein at the bend of<lb/>
the elbow. (2) Injection of partially defibrinated blood. (3) Injec-<lb/>
tion of partially defibrinated blood heated for 10 minutes at 55&deg; C.<lb/>
(4) Injection of blood serum previously diluted with sterilized water<lb/>
and filtered slowly through a Berkefeld laboratory filter.</p>

</table>
</p>
<p>By an examination of this table it will be seen that of the seven<lb/>
individuals who received subcutaneously the fresh or partially defi-<lb/>
brinated blood in quantities of 0.5-2 c. c., six (85.7 per cent) developed<lb/>
an attack of yellow fever within the usual period of incubation of the<lb/>
disease.</p>
<p>These results are of very great interest as demonstrating that the<lb/>
specific agent of yellow fever is present in the blood, <hi>at least during the<lb/>
first, second, and third days of the attack</hi>.</p>
<p>Another important point brought out by these experiments was<lb/>
that the blood which conveyed the disease did not contain any bac-<lb/>
terium which would grow on our usual laboratory media.</p>
<p>In order to establish this fact, as soon as blood had been injected<lb/>
into the nonimmune subject, additional blood was, at once, withdrawn<lb/>
in considerable quantity and transferred to tubes of nutritive bouillon.<lb/>
In one instance, where 2 c. c. of blood had been drawn into the syringe,<lb/>
0.5 c. c. of this sufficed, when injected, to produce a severe attack of<lb/>
yellow fever, after 73 hours' incubation, while the remaining 1.5 c. c.<lb/>
transferred immediately to four tubes of bouillon gave no growth,<lb/>
except that from one tube we isolated on the fourth day <hi rend="italic">Staphylo-<lb/>
coccus pyogenes citreus</hi>, found by us to be a common skin-contami-<lb/>
nating organism in Cuba.</p>
<p>Table I further shows that the specific agent contained in the blood<lb/>
is destroyed or attenuated by heating the latter at 55&deg; C. for 10 min-<lb/>
utes, so that the injection of 1.5 c. c. of this heated blood was harm-<lb/>
less (cases VII, VIII, and IX), while the injection of 0.75 c. c. of the<lb/>
same blood unheated sufficed to promptly induce an attack of yellow<lb/>
fever in a &ldquo;control&rdquo; individual (case VI).</p>
<p>Of not less interest was the fact brought out by these observations<lb/>
that yellow fever can be produced by the injection of a small quantity<lb/>
of bacteria-free serum filtrate, obtained by passing the diluted serum<lb/>
through a Berkefeld laboratory filter (cases X and XI), and further<lb/>
that the blood of a case of yellow fever, thus produced, when injected<lb/>
into a third nonimmune subject will promptly bring about an attack<lb/>
of this disease (case XII); thus demonstrating that the specific agent<lb/>
of yellow fever can find its way through the pores of a filter which ordi-<lb/>
narily serves to prevent the passage of all known bacteria.</p>
<p>I have elsewhere (12) in conjunction with one of my colleagues<lb/>
(Carroll) discussed the facts here presented more at length and will<lb/>
limit myself, therefore, to the remark that these experiments appear<lb/>
<pb n="165" id="S8220175"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
165<lb/>
to indicate that yellow fever, like the foot-and-mouth disease of<lb/>
cattle, is caused by a <hi>micro-organism so minute in size that it might<lb/>
be designated as ultramicroscopic</hi>.</p>
<p>THE PROPAGATION OF YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>Prior to the time at which the foregoing observations were made<lb/>
the commission had already turned its entire attention to the possible<lb/>
solution of the problem of the propagation of yellow fever, being<lb/>
induced thereto, not only by the fruitlessness of the investigations<lb/>
made thus far along bacteriological lines, but, also, by reason of cer-<lb/>
tain facts which seemed to call for a better interpretation than had<lb/>
hitherto been accorded them.</p>
<p>Without entering into details, I may say that, <hi>in the first place, the<lb/>
commission saw, with some surprise, what had so often been noted</hi> in<lb/>
the literature, that patients in all stages of yellow fever could be cared<lb/>
for by nonimmune nurses without danger of contracting the disease.<lb/>
The noncontagious character of yellow fever was, therefore, hardly to<lb/>
be questioned.</p>
<p>In the second place, it had been observed that patients discharged<lb/>
from the wards during <hi>early convalescence could be brought</hi> into<lb/>
intimate association with nonimmune individuals without thereby<lb/>
establishing fresh foci of the disease. This did not seem to indicate<lb/>
that any specific agent was present in the excreta of the sick.</p>
<p>Again, it has been noted that in certain cases of this disease no<lb/>
growth had been obtained on the ordinary laboratory media, either<lb/>
by frequent cultures from the blood during life or from the blood<lb/>
and organs after death.</p>
<p>Further, in the course of an investigation which the commission<lb/>
were able to make during the <hi>last week of July, 1900, concerning</hi> the<lb/>
origin and spread of a small epidemic of yellow fever that had<lb/>
appeared in a military garrison, numbering about 900 men, <hi>at Pinar<lb/>
del Rio, Cuba</hi>, they had seen that by reason of the false diagnosis of<lb/>
&ldquo;pernicious malarial fever&rdquo; which had been given to these cases no<lb/>
disinfection of bedding or clothing had been carried out; <hi>and yet<lb/>
there was no indication that this neglect had contributed in the<lb/>
least to the spread of the disease; nor had any harm come to those<lb/>
nonimmunes who had slept in the beds vacated by the sick, or<lb/>
washed the supposedly infected garments of those who had recovered<lb/>
or died of this disease</hi>.</p>
<p>Putting these various data together, it seemed probable that more<lb/>
<hi>progress might be made if attention should be turned to the mode</hi> of<lb/>
transmission of yellow fever, especially as our own observations had<lb/>
caused us to seriously doubt the usually accepted belief of the con-<lb/>
veyance of this disease by means of fomites.</p>
<p>Then, too, the endemic curve of yellow fever in the city of Habana,<lb/>
and its well-known epidemic curve in the United States, appeared to<lb/>
be more intimately associated with and more affected by the rise and<lb/>
fall of the annual temperature curve than was to be seen in any of<lb/>
the acute infections, except malarial fever. The peculiar behavior<lb/>
of this disease (if I may use the expression) in rapidly spreading in<lb/>
certain localities, when introduced, as contrasted with its failure to<lb/>
propagate itself in other places, where the conditions for its increase<lb/>
were apparently just as favorable, seemed to point in the strongest<lb/>
<pb n="166" id="S8220176"/>
166<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
manner to the necessity for some special agent or intermediate host<lb/>
in the dissemination of its specific cause. If malarial fever--a dis-<lb/>
ease so much affected by temperature conditions--required the<lb/>
agency of a special genus of mosquito for its propagation, as had in<lb/>
recent years been so brilliantly worked out by <hi>Ross, Grassi, Bas-<lb/>
tianelli, Bignami, and others</hi>, it did not seem unreasonable to sup-<lb/>
pose that yellow fever--a disease so plainly controlled by seasonal<lb/>
conditions--might also depend on some such agent for its spread.<lb/>
Influenced by this line of reasoning, the commission began, during<lb/>
the second week of August, 1900, its observations relative to the<lb/>
propagation of yellow fever by means of the bite of a certain species<lb/>
of mosquito--<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi>.</p>
<p><hi>The work along this line was carried forward so rapidly that, within<lb/>
30 days, 11 individuals had been bitten by infected Stegomyia</hi>,<lb/>
of whom two <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> developed well-marked attacks of yellow fever within<lb/>
the usual period of incubation, and under such circumstances as to<lb/>
positively <hi>exclude in one case any</hi> other possible source of infection.</p>
<p>Appreciating fully the importance of this discovery and in order to<lb/>
exclude all other possible sources of infection in our future observa-<lb/>
tions, it was now determined to establish a special experimental<lb/>
station where further observations could be made on nonimmune<lb/>
human beings, both as to the propagation of yellow fever by means<lb/>
of the bite of the mosquito as well as by exposure to the most inti-<lb/>
mate contact with infected clothing and bedding, and this under the<lb/>
strictest enforcement of military quarantine. With the approval<lb/>
and assistance of the military governor of the Island of Cuba, this<lb/>
experimental station was ready for occupancy on November 20, 1900,<lb/>
<hi>and was continuously occupied until March 1, 1901</hi>.</p>
<p>As the results obtained at this station have already been published<lb/>
(13) in full elsewhere, I will here only present a brief account, first of<lb/>
the experiments with fomites and afterwards of those made with in-<lb/>
fected mosquitoes.</p>
<p>ATTEMPTS AT INFECTION BY FOMITES.</p>
<p>I quote from a paper which the writer presented for the commission<lb/>
at the meeting of the Pan-American Medical Congress,<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> held in<lb/>
Habana, Cuba, February 4-7, 1901:</p>
<p>For this purpose there was erected at Camp Lazear a small frame house consisting<lb/>
of one room, 14 by 20 feet, and known as &ldquo;building No. 1,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;infected clothing<lb/>
and bedding building.&rdquo; The cubic capacity of this house was 2,800 feet. It was<lb/>
tightly sealed within with &ldquo;tongued and grooved&rdquo; boards, and was well battened on<lb/>
the outside. <hi>It faced the south</hi> and was provided with <hi>two small windows</hi>, each 26 by<lb/>
34 inches in size. These windows were both placed <hi>on the south side</hi> of the building,<lb/>
the purpose being to prevent, as much as possible, any thorough circulation of the<lb/>
air within the house. They were closed by permanent wire-screens of 0.5 mm. mesh.<lb/>
In addition a sliding glass sash was provided within and heavy wooden shutters with-<lb/>
out; the latter intended to prevent the entrance of sunlight into the building, as it<lb/>
was not deemed desirable that the disinfecting qualities of sunlight, direct or diffused,<lb/>
should at any time be exerted on the articles of clothing contained within this room.<lb/>
Entrance was effected through a small vestibule, 3 by 5 feet, <hi>also placed on the southern<lb/>
side of the house</hi>. This vestibule was protected without by a solid door and was<lb/>
divided in its middle by a wire-screen door, swung on spring hinges. The inner<lb/>
entrance was also closed by a second wire-screen door. In this way the passage of</p>

<p>mosquitoes into this room was effectually excluded. During the day and until after<lb/>
sunset the house was kept securely closed, while by means of <hi>a suitable heating<lb/>
apparatus the</hi> temperature was raised to 92&deg;-95&deg; F. Precaution was taken at the same<lb/>
time to maintain a sufficient humidity of the atmosphere. The average temperature<lb/>
of this house was thus kept up at 76.2&deg; F. for a period of sixty-three days.</p>
<p>November 30, 1900, the building now being ready for occupancy, three large boxes<lb/>
filled with sheets, pillowcases, blankets, etc., contaminated by contact with cases of<lb/>
yellow fever and their discharges were received and placed therein. The majority<lb/>
of the articles had been taken from the beds of patients sick with yellow fever at Las<lb/>
Animas Hospital, Habana, or at Columbia Barracks. Many of them had been pur-<lb/>
posely soiled with a liberal quantity of black vomit, urine, and fecal matter. A dirty<lb/>
&ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; and a much-soiled pair of blankets, removed from the bed of a patient<lb/>
sick with yellow fever in the town of Quemados were contained in one of these boxes.<lb/>
The same day, at 6 p. m., Dr. R. P. Cooke, acting assistant surgeon, United States<lb/>
Army, and two privates of the Hospital Corps, all nonimmune young Americans,<lb/>
entered this building and deliberately unpacked these boxes, which had been tightly<lb/>
closed and locked for a period of two weeks. They were careful at the same time to<lb/>
give each article a thorough handling and shaking, in order to disseminate through the<lb/>
air of the room the specific agent of yellow fever, if contained in these fomites. These<lb/>
soiled sheets, pillowcases, and blankets were used in preparing the beds in which the<lb/>
members of the Hospital Corps slept. Various soiled articles were hung around the<lb/>
room and placed about the bed occupied by Dr. Cooke.</p>
<p>From this date until December 19, 1900, a period of 20 days, this room was occupied<lb/>
each night by these three nonimmunes. Each morning the various soiled articles<lb/>
were carefully repacked in the aforesaid boxes, and at night again unpacked and dis-<lb/>
tributed about the room. During the day the residents of this house were permitted<lb/>
to occupy a tent pitched in the immediate vicinity, but were kept in strict quarantine.</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>December 19 these three nonimmunes were placed in quarantine for five days and<lb/>
then given the liberty of the camp. All had remained in perfect health, notwith-<lb/>
standing their stay of 20 nights amid such unwholesome surroundings.</p>
<p>During the week December 20-27 the following articles were also placed in this<lb/>
house, viz, pajamas suit, 1; undershirts, 2; nightshirts, 4; pillow slips, 4; sheets, 6;<lb/>
blankets, 5; pillows, 2; mattress, 1. These articles had been removed from the per-<lb/>
sons and beds of four patients sick with yellow fever and were very much soiled, as<lb/>
any change of clothing or bed linen during their attacks had been purposely avoided,<lb/>
the object being to obtain articles as thoroughly contaminated as possible.</p>
<p>From December 21, 1900, till January 10, 1901, this building was again occupied<lb/>
by two nonimmune young Americans under the same conditions as the preceding<lb/>
occupants, except that these men slept every night in the very garments worn by<lb/>
yellow fever patients throughout their entire attacks, besides making use exclusively<lb/>
of their much-soiled pillow slips, sheets, and blankets. At the end of <hi>21 nights</hi> of<lb/>
such intimate contact with these fomites, they also went into quarantine, from which<lb/>
<hi>they were released five days later in perfect health</hi>.</p>
<p>From January 11 till January 31, a period of 20 days, &ldquo;building No. 1&rdquo; continued<lb/>
to be occupied by two other nonimmune Americans, who, like those who preceded<lb/>
them, have slept every night in the beds formerly occupied by yellow fever patients,<lb/>
and in the nightshirts used by these patients throughout the attack without change.<lb/>
In addition, during the last 14 nights of their occupancy of this house they had slept<lb/>
each night with their pillows covered with towels that had been thoroughly soiled<lb/>
with the blood drawn from both the general and capillary circulation on the first day<lb/>
of the disease, in the case of a well-marked attack of yellow fever. Notwithstanding<lb/>
this trying ordeal these men have continued to remain in perfect health.</p>
<p>The attempt which we have therefore made to infect &ldquo;building No. 1&rdquo; and its seven<lb/>
nonimmune occupants during a period of 63 nights has proved an absolute failure.</p>

<p>While the experiments with fomites were being carried out in<lb/>
&ldquo;Building No. 1,&rdquo; certain nonimmune individuals who were lodged<lb/>
in tents, in a separate part of the camp, were being subjected, with<lb/>
their full consent, to the bites of mosquitoes which had previously fed<lb/>
on the blood of cases of yellow fever occurring in the city of Havana.<lb/>
Thus during the period from December 5, 1900, to February 7, 1901,<lb/>
we had subjected to this method of infection 12 nonimmune subjects,<lb/>

<p>The positive results obtained, therefore, by this mode of infection<lb/>
stand in striking contrast to the negative experiments made with<lb/>
fomites. Indeed, cases VIII and XI of Table II had each slept 21<lb/>
nights in the garments of yellow fever patients while occupants of<lb/>
&ldquo;building No. 1.&rdquo; As they had remained in perfect health at Camp<lb/>
Lazear for yet 30 days longer, they were at the expiration of this<lb/>
time bitten by infected mosquitoes solely for the purpose of testing<lb/>
their immunity and with the result that an attack of yellow fever<lb/>
promptly followed in each case.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind, also, that of the nonimmune residents<lb/>
at Camp Lazear, while all lived under the same hygienic conditions,<lb/>
only those individuals developed yellow fever who were purposely<lb/>
bitten by contaminated mosquitoes, or injected with the blood of<lb/>
those sick with this disease. Moreover, the precision with which the<lb/>
infection of the individual followed the bite of the mosquito left<lb/>
nothing to be desired in order to fulfil the requirements of a scientific<lb/>
experiment.</p>
<p>Case V of Table II is of especial interest, when taken in connection<lb/>
with the failure to induce the disease by contact with fomites.</p>
<p>This individual, having been quarantined for 32 days at Camp<lb/>
Lazear, volunteered to enter a newly erected building in which<lb/>
15 contaminated mosquitoes had just been freed. His first visit<lb/>
was at noon, December 21, 1900, and the length of his <hi>stay 30 min</hi>-<lb/>
utes. At 4.30 p. m. the same day he again entered this building and<lb/>
remained <hi>20 minutes</hi>. The following day at 4.30 p. m. he for the<lb/>
third time visited this room and <hi>remained 20 minutes</hi>. During<lb/>
each of these visits he was bitten by mosquitoes. He did not enter<lb/>
the building again, nor was he exposed to any other source of infec-<lb/>
tion. Nevertheless at the expiration of 3 days and 23 hours, or<lb/>
at 6 a. m. December 25, 1900, he was suddenly seized with an attack<lb/>
of yellow fever, which proved to be severe in character. That the<lb/>
infection was occasioned by the bites of contaminated mosquitoes was<lb/>
plainly shown by the immunity from the disease enjoyed by two<lb/>
<pb n="169" id="S220179"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
169<lb/>
nonimmune &ldquo;controls,&rdquo; who, protected only by a wire-screen parti-<lb/>
tion, had been present at each of the subject's visits and who under<lb/>
the same conditions of security against the bites of the infected mos-<lb/>
quitoes continued to sleep in and breathe the common atmosphere<lb/>
of this room <hi>for yet 18 nights</hi>.</p>
<p>To the positive cases contained in Table II, which were produced at<lb/>
Camp Lazear, we are now able to add 4 other cases of yellow fever<lb/>
occasioned by the bites of infected mosquitoes, thus making a total of<lb/>
14 cases, in each of which happily recovery followed.</p>
<p>A very important point brought out by these observations is that<lb/>
an interval of about 12 days or more after contamination appears to<lb/>
be necessary before the infected <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi> is capable of conveying<lb/>
the disease to a susceptible individual. Repeated experiments made<lb/>
with insects which had bitten yellow fever patients 2 to 10 days pre-<lb/>
viously were always negative, although these same insects were<lb/>
proven capable of conveying the disease after having been kept until<lb/>
17 to 24 days had elapsed. Our observations (14) further demonstrate<lb/>
that mosquitoes that have been kept for period varying from 39 to<lb/>
57 days after contamination are still capable of conveying the disease,<lb/>
and further that infected <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi> may <hi>survive for a period of at<lb/>
least 71 days</hi>. This will explain how the contagion of yellow fever<lb/>
may cling to a building, although it has been vacated for a period of<lb/>
two or more months.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that the observations made by means of blood<lb/>
injections (Table I) were only undertaken after we had succeeded in<lb/>
demonstrating that the disease could be conveyed by the bites of<lb/>
infected <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi>, it will be seen that our study of the method of<lb/>
propagation of yellow fever, at Camp Lazear, sufficed to prove very<lb/>
definitely that, while the natural mode of transmission of this disease<lb/>
is through the bites of infected mosquitoes, yellow fever may also be<lb/>
conveyed, like malarial fever, by the injection of a small quantity of<lb/>
blood taken from the veins of an individual suffering with this disease.</p>
<p>Per contra, our observations show that, notwithstanding the com-<lb/>
mon belief in this mode of transmission, yellow fever can not be<lb/>
induced in the nonimmune individual even by the most intimate con-<lb/>
tact with contaminated articles of clothing and bedding.</p>
<p>Although the investigations made at Camp Lazear were only con-<lb/>
cluded one year ago, already confirmatory evidence of the strongest<lb/>
character has been furnished in a series of experiments carried out by<lb/>
Guit&eacute;ras (15) at the inoculation station of the sanitary department<lb/>
of Habana.</p>
<p>I may be pardoned for quoting the paragraph with which Guit&eacute;ras<lb/>
begins his contribution. He says: &ldquo;The favorable results obtained by<lb/>
the United States Army commission in their experiments with yellow<lb/>
fever, the continued series of mild cases resulting from these experi-<lb/>
ments without a death, suggested very naturally the continuation of<lb/>
their work on a larger scale; not with a view to control or confirm the<lb/>
conclusions of the commission, for anyone who had followed their<lb/>
work with unprejudiced attention must have concluded that their<lb/>
solution of the problem of the etiology of yellow fever was final; but<lb/>
rather in the hope of propagating the disease in a controllable form,<lb/>
and securing amongst the recently arrived immigrants immuniza-<lb/>
tion, with the minimum amount of danger to themselves and the<lb/>
community.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="170" id="S220180"/>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>Of a total of <hi>42 individuals inoculated by Guit&eacute;ras 25 were rejected<lb/>
by him by reason of having been bitten by insects that had been<lb/>
applied to cases of fever about which the diagnosis was in doubt</hi>. The<lb/>
following table, therefore, only includes <hi>17 persons who were bitten</hi><lb/>
by <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi> that had previously <hi>fed on unmistakable cases of yellow</hi><lb/>
fever at intervals of 14 to 36 days before being applied to the non-<lb/>
immune subject.</p>

</p>
<p>A more complete confirmation of the results obtained by the<lb/>
American commission could not be furnished than the data contained<lb/>
in the foregoing table, since they show that <hi>of 17 individuals who<lb/>
were bitten by infected <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi>, 8 (47 per cent) developed<lb/>
the disease. Most unfortunately, in three of these cases very grave<lb/>
symptoms ensued, such as black vomit and suppression of the urine,<lb/>
which eventuated in the death of the patients</hi>. I may add that in the<lb/>
hands of Guit&eacute;ras <hi>fomites failed</hi> to exert any effect on nonimmunes.</p>
<p><hi>Whether other species of mosquitoes than <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi> are capable of</hi><lb/>
conveying the parasite of yellow fever <hi>has not as yet been determined<lb/>
by the commission; nor have we</hi> been able to ascertain whether the<lb/>
parasite passes from the mother insect to daughter insects. The<lb/>
experiments which we have thus far been able to make for the purpose<lb/>
of determining these important points, although negative, have been<lb/>
too few in number to warrant any definite expression of opinion.</p>
<p>THE PREVENTION OF YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>The definite determination of the way in which yellow fever is<lb/>
transmitted from the sick to the well furnishes a solution at last of<lb/>
that much vexed problem of how to prevent the spread of the disease.<lb/>
Even in the absence of more definite knowledge concerning its specific<lb/>
agent--knowledge greatly to be desired from the scientific stand-<lb/>
point--we are now able, as sanitarians, to direct our efforts along cer-<lb/>
tain well-defined lines, with a feeling of security heretofore unknown.</p>
<p>From the point of view of prevention the situation may be briefly<lb/>
summed up in the following conclusion, which was presented by the<lb/>
American Army commission to the Pan-American Congress of 1900,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
171<lb/>
viz, &ldquo;The spread of yellow fever can be most effectually controlled by<lb/>
measures directed to the destruction of mosquitoes and the protection<lb/>
of the sick against the bites of these insects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This conclusion was the logical outcome of the observations that<lb/>
had been made by the commission at its experimental station near<lb/>
Quemados, Cuba.</p>
<p>The importance of the discovery that yellow fever is transmitted by<lb/>
the bite of a certain species of mosquito did not fail to attract the<lb/>
prompt attention of the military governor of the island of Cuba,<lb/>
himself a physician and formerly a distinguished member of the<lb/>
Medical Department of the United States Army. By his direction<lb/>
the theory was at once subjected to a practical test in the city of<lb/>
Habana, in which city yellow fever had not failed to make its yearly<lb/>
appearance during the past 140 years.</p>
<p>Under the efficient management of the chief sanitary officer,<lb/>
Surg. Maj. Wm. C. Gorgas, United States Army, the sanitary regula-<lb/>
tions were so far modified as to require that every patient having yel-<lb/>
low fever should not only be quarantined, but that his room should be<lb/>
<hi>promptly protected with wire screens, so as to prevent the possibility</hi><lb/>
of mosquitoes becoming infected by sucking the blood of the patient.<lb/>
As a <hi>second important measure, a systematic destruction of all mos-<lb/>
quitoes in other rooms of the patient's house, as well</hi> as in adjoining<lb/>
houses, was at once begun, the fumes of <hi rend="italic">pyrethrum</hi> being relied upon<lb/>
to stupify the insects, after which they were carefully swept up and<lb/>
burned. In other words, Surg. Maj. Gorgas relying upon the well-<lb/>
known slow progress of yellow fever sought to destroy all mosquitoes,<lb/>
infected or noninfected, within a given radius of each case, while at the<lb/>
same time he effectually excluded all mosquitoes from access to the<lb/>
sick. If a secondary case occurred, the same hygienic measures<lb/>
were vigorously enforced along the lines above indicated.</p>
<p>As an illustration of what has been accomplished by these newer<lb/>
sanitary regulations, I may state that counting from the date when<lb/>
they were put into force--<hi>viz, February 15, 1901</hi>--Habana was freed<lb/>
from yellow fever within 90 days; so that from May 7 to July 1--<lb/>
a period of 54 days--no cases occurred. Notwithstanding the fact<lb/>
that on the latter date, and during the months of July, August, and<lb/>
September, the disease was repeatedly reintroduced into Habana<lb/>
from an inland town, no difficulty was encountered in promptly<lb/>
stamping it out by the same measures of sanitation intelligently<lb/>
applied both in the city of Habana as well as in the town of Santiago<lb/>
de las Vegas, whence the disease was being brought into Havana.</p>
<p>As a further illustration of the remarkable sanitary victory accom-<lb/>
plished over a disease whose progress we had heretofore been powerless<lb/>
to arrest, I will close this paper by inviting the reader's attention, first<lb/>
to the accompanying Chart I, which shows the average monthly<lb/>
mortality from yellow fever in Habana for the 20 years 1880-1899,<lb/>
inclusive, and also the mortality by month for the years 1900 and<lb/>
1901. I will then ask him to examine Chart II, which shows the<lb/>
progress of yellow fever in Habana during the epidemic year, ending<lb/>
March 1, 1901, when the sanitary authorities were putting forth every<lb/>
effort known at that time to sanitary science in order to control the<lb/>
march of the disease; and when he has satisfied himself that no effect<lb/>
whatever was produced upon the epidemic of that year, I will invite<lb/>
his attention to Chart III, which shows the occurrence of this disease</p>

<p>in Habana for the epidemic year March 1, 1901, to March 1, 1902,<lb/>
during which year yellow fever was fought on the theory that the<lb/>
specific agent of this disease is transmitted solely by means of the<lb/>
bites of infected mosquitoes. By carefully comparing the figures<lb/>
both as to deaths and cases in these two charts, and recalling that<lb/>
between the years 1853 and 1900 there have been recorded in the city<lb/>
of Habana 35,952 deaths from yellow fever, he will then be able to<lb/>
more clearly appreciate the value of the work accomplished by the<lb/>
American Army commission.</p>

<p>[Read at the forty-fourth session of the American Medical Association, in the section on practice of medi-<lb/>
cine, and approved for publication by the executive committee: Drs. J. M. Anders, Frank A. Jones, and<lb/>
W. S. Thayer.]</p>
<p>Several American observers have noted that during the yellow<lb/>
fever outbreaks mosquitoes were very numerous, among them<lb/>
Rush (1), at Philadelphia in 1797; Dr. Weightman (2), of the United<lb/>
States Army, at St. Augustine, Fla., in 1839; Dr. Wood (3), at Center-<lb/>
ville, Miss., in 1853. Dr. E. H. Barton (3) states &ldquo;that at Clinton,<lb/>
La., in 1853, mosquitoes were uncommonly numerous night and day.&rdquo;<lb/>
At Trinity, La., in the same year, when sawdust was used to fill<lb/>
up low places in the streets, the disease was not propagated, though<lb/>
many cases were brought there and no precautions were used(3).<lb/>
It is hardly necessary to note what the effect of this obliteration of<lb/>
puddles would be on the development of mosquitoes. Dr. Beyren-<lb/>
heidt (3), of Biloxi, Miss., in reporting a severe epidemic at that place<lb/>
in 1853, during which 533 cases and 111 deaths occurred in a popula-<lb/>
tion of 5,520, makes the interesting statement that &ldquo;mosquitoes<lb/>
and fleas were very abundant.&rdquo; Dr. Bennett Dowler strongly<lb/>
urged drainage of the city of New Orleans, and spoke of the city and<lb/>
its environs as &ldquo;mosquito lands&rdquo; (4). La Roche (5) states that in<lb/>
1793, during the epidemic in Philadelphia, &ldquo;the narrow streets and<lb/>
alleys near the wharves, as, indeed, in many other parts, were in a<lb/>
foul state, and the gutters almost everywhere sadly neglected.&rdquo; In<lb/>
1794 Rush and others ascribed the fever to exhalations from wharves,<lb/>
neglected gutters, and stagnant ponds(5). In 1797, during another<lb/>
outbreak in Philadelphia, the condition was practically the same;<lb/>
the Academy of Medicine called the attention of the governor to<lb/>
the putrid exhalations from the gutters, streets, ponds, and marshy<lb/>
grounds of the neighborhood of the city (5). While high temperature,<lb/>
low altitude, and the presence of standing water are the conditions <lb/>
most favorable to the development of a yellow fever epidemic, there<lb/>
are numerous instances on record where the disease after introduc-<lb/>
tion spread from house to house throughout the town in places<lb/>
where the general conditions of sanitation and drainage were good.<lb/>
This is now explained by the habits of the mosquito (<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia<lb/>
fasciata</hi>), which breeds in standing water, in houses as well as out of</p>

doors. As a general rule, in ports where yellow fever epidemics first<lb/>
appear, the conditions are known to be favorable for the develop-<lb/>
ment of enormous numbers of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>A very interesting observation was made in 1839 in South Africa<lb/>
by William Ferguson, then a surgeon in the South African corps, in<lb/>
regard to the extension of yellow fever from Sierra Leone (where it<lb/>
had been brought on vessels from the West Indies) to Gambia,<lb/>
Goree, and Ascension, the subsequent ports of arrival of some of<lb/>
these infected vessels. After mentioning an unusually heavy accu-<lb/>
mulation of mud and filth in a pit at Ascension, which was said to<lb/>
have been the cause of the fever occurring after an unusually heavy<lb/>
fall of rain, he makes the following statement:</p>
<p>(6) It will be observed that at Ascension, at Goree, and at Gambia a period of three<lb/>
or four weeks always elapsed betwixt the landing of the sick and the epidemic out-<lb/>
breaking of the disease among the population, a degree of uniformity worthy of remark<lb/>
whether the conclusions at which I have arrived (that the disease was carried to these<lb/>
places on infected vessels) be mistaken or not.</p>
<p>These outbreaks were accompanied by black vomit and were<lb/>
undoubtedly yellow fever of imported origin.</p>
<p>Just 60 years <hi>later Carter (7) made a</hi> similar observation in the<lb/>
United States, shortening the period slightly and giving cases and<lb/>
data. In a later paper (8) he designates the interval between pri-<lb/>
mary and secondary cases the period of &ldquo;extrinsic incubation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The known facts regarding the apparent noncontagiousness of the<lb/>
disease, the peculiar manner in which it has been seen to pass from<lb/>
one house to another without intercommunication of the inhabitants,<lb/>
and the numerous points of resemblance between yellow fever and<lb/>
malaria, <hi>led us to expect results from</hi> mosquito inoculations in yellow<lb/>
fever. After satisfying ourselves that <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi> (Sanarelli) was<lb/>
not to be considered, <hi>Drs. Reed, Lazear, and myself, in consultation</hi>,<lb/>
decided that the mosquito theory had many facts to support it and<lb/>
could be promptly decided one way or the other. This leads us to a<lb/>
consideration of the mosquito theory of Finlay.</p>
<p>At the session of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Habana, August<lb/>
14, 1881, Finlay first gave to the world his memorable theory of the<lb/>
transmission of yellow fever by the mosquito, and reported five<lb/>
experiments, which are included in the accompanying table, <hi>compris-<lb/>
ing all of Finlay's and Delgado's positive cases published in 1891</hi>. (9)</p>
<p><hi>Finlay</hi> believed (10) that the transfer of the specific agent of the<lb/>
disease from patient to nonimmune was effected mechanically by the<lb/>
insect's proboscis (14) and that the infection would be conveyed<lb/>
immediately if the insect chanced to bite a susceptible person a few<lb/>
moments after feeding on a patient in the proper stage of the dis-<lb/>
ease. (11) He also thought that the graver forms of yellow fever<lb/>
might be produced by the bite <hi>of <hi rend="italic">Culex pungens</hi></hi>, because the insect<lb/>
ingested a larger amount of blood than stegomyia, and consequently<lb/>
a greater quantity of the virus would be retained on its proboscis<lb/>
(stylet). (11) He ventured the opinion that yellow fever was a sort<lb/>
of eruptive fever, and that the seat of the eruption was the endothelial<lb/>
lining of the blood vessels, and that the mosquito picked up the inocu-<lb/>
lable material from the interior of the blood vessels on its biting appa-<lb/>
ratus and transferred the same to the interior of the vessels of the per-<lb/>
son subsequently bitten.</p>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p><hi>In a later paper</hi> he assumes that the picking up of these germs by the<lb/>
proboscis of the mosquito <hi>is selective</hi>, because there is nothing to prove<lb/>
that other inoculable diseases have ever been so transmitted. From<lb/>
four culture experiments, in each of which the head and the pro-<lb/>
boscis of a mosquito were dropped into a bouillon tube, he infers that<lb/>
the <hi>head and the proboscis of the day mosquito possess bactericidal<lb/>
properties for ordinary bacteria and fungi with the exception of a<lb/>
coccus, which</hi> was subsequently (12) claimed to be the specific agent<lb/>
of the disease. (13) The sting of the mosquito is suggested as the<lb/>
&ldquo;intermediate host&rdquo; necessary for some phase of development of<lb/>
disease germs. (14)</p>
<p>As late as 1899 Finlay mentions the isolation of the tetracoccus from<lb/>
culture media into which the heads and proboscides of contaminated<lb/>
mosquitoes had been dropped, as one of the three results of his experi-<lb/>
ments on yellow fever mosquitoes.</p>
<p>In a paper (13) published in 1895 he announced some very interest-<lb/>
ing results obtained with <hi>the &ldquo;tetracoccus.&rdquo;</hi> A number of rabbits<lb/>
were inoculated intraperitoneally with cultures in bouillon; one of<lb/>
these cultures had been obtained from the head and the proboscis of a<lb/>
mosquito by placing them in a tube of bouillon five days after the<lb/>
insect had bitten a yellow-fever patient; the others came from the<lb/>
finger blood and milk of yellow-fever patients. All of the rabbits<lb/>
died; some of them showed infarcts of the kidneys, lungs, and liver.<lb/>
A rabbit obtained from the country was placed in the stable where<lb/>
some of the other rabbits had been kept, and at the end of eight days<lb/>
it was found dead. The tetracoccus was obtained from its heart's<lb/>
blood.</p>
<p>Eleven days after the rabbits had been removed from the house<lb/>
(the stable is usually a part of the house in Habana) a Spanish wet<lb/>
nurse came to spend some time there and on the third day following<lb/>
her arrival she was attacked with yellow fever. Mosquitoes had been<lb/>
unusually abundant in the house during the whole time the inocu-<lb/>
lated rabbits had been kept in it, and we are asked to keep this in<lb/>
mind in view of the possible transmission of the disease from animals<lb/>
to man. We are told that the blood from the finger of this woman on<lb/>
the third day of her illness gave the &ldquo;pale yellow tetracoccus,&rdquo; and<lb/>
the milk from her breast gave a &ldquo;white tetracoccus,&rdquo; which proved<lb/>
fatal to a rabbit in 15 days. (13)</p>
<p>While reading the accounts of these experiments one is constantly<lb/>
reminded of the pathogenic staphylococci. It is strongly suggested<lb/>
(13) <hi>that the rabbits died of yellow fever</hi>, and it is asserted that the<lb/>
experiments justified the assumption that the tetracoccus was the<lb/>
&ldquo;specific germ of yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The statement is also made in this paper that of 100 presumably<lb/>
susceptible persons who had received the mosquito inoculation during<lb/>
the 14 years previous, only 3 had subsequently died of yellow fever.<lb/>
(13)</p>
<p>I have been unable to find records of these 100 cases in the library<lb/>
of the Surgeon General's Office, and submit those of which the data<lb/>
are accessible to me. As these include the cases on which Dr. Finlay's<lb/>
claim is based they will suffice for the purpose. The 54 negative cases<lb/>
are omitted.</p>
<pb n="179" id="S8220191"/>
<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
179</p>
<p>Case 3 was bitten by a mosquito that had been fed on bloody<lb/>
excrement from another mosquito that had been found inside the<lb/>
mosquito net of a fatal case. The material was allowed to dry for<lb/>
27 days in the test tube and was then moistened with a little sugar<lb/>
and water to prepare it for feeding. (15) There is a marked difference<lb/>
between the method of procedure herein described and that given in<lb/>
1901, (16) when Dr. Finlay said:</p>
<p>I applied a nocturnal mosquito and allowed it to fill itself from a case of yellow fever.<lb/>
After pricking the side of the insect's abdomen I mixed the blood which escaped<lb/>
with a drop of sterilized sirup and fed with it a fresh culex mosquito, and finally<lb/>
applied the latter to a third soldier (July 29). Two days later, July 31, the soldier<lb/>
went to the hospital with a fever which was also recorded as &ldquo;abortive yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This case (L. G. P.) was omitted from the paper published in 1881,<lb/>
as stated, but was included in 1891 in the report from which the cases<lb/>
here recorded are taken.</p>
<p>Case 4 is further discussed in English in a footnote on page 368 of<lb/>
the Revista de la Asociacion Medico-Farmaceutica, Habana, Feb-<lb/>
ruary, 1902. (History of illness vague. Did not go to bed or report<lb/>
himself sick.) The first 5 cases were newly arrived soldiers, stationed<lb/>
at Cabanas and who were brought to the city of Habana for exami-<lb/>
nation once in every 5 days.</p>
<p>Case 9 is cited by Finlay (17) in refutation of our conclusion (18)<lb/>
that the mosquito is not capable of infecting until about 12 days or<lb/>
more have elapsed after it has bitten the patient.</p>
<p>Case 55 was a Spaniard, newly arrived, who lived at a country<lb/>
residence. At both attempts to inoculate him the mosquitoes failed<lb/>
to bite; nevertheless he was taken sick August 26. Another non-<lb/>
immune who occupied an adjoining room was taken sick with similar<lb/>
symptoms, a few days later. <hi>No further comment is</hi> necessary,<lb/>
except that the cases of the Army commission and of Dr. Guit&eacute;ras<lb/>
<hi>were kept under close observation and strict control. Nearly all of<lb/>
Dr. Finlay's cases were exposed to infection in the city of Habana.<lb/>
Only four of them come within the recognized periods of incubation</hi>,<lb/>
viz, Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 66. The first three of these were inoculated in<lb/>
Habana in July, 1881, during which month there were 90 deaths<lb/>
from yellow fever in that city alone. The last was inoculated in<lb/>
August, 1890. In that month 60 deaths from yellow fever are<lb/>
recorded for the city of Habana.</p>
<p>Finlay has published a great many conjectures and speculations<lb/>
in regard to yellow-fever transmission. <hi>Some of these, such as the</hi><lb/>
belief that the disease was transmitted by the mosquito, have been<lb/>
<hi>proven by our work, but not in accordance with his ideas. I can<lb/>
find no evidence that he has produced a single case of yellow fever<lb/>
by his inoculations</hi>. In the first place the mosquito is <hi>incapable</hi> of<lb/>
transmitting the disease in so short a period as 2 to 5 days after<lb/>
biting the patient. In the second place <hi>7 days must be placed as the<lb/>
extreme limit of incubation in the human being. Our</hi> longest period<lb/>
was between 5 and 6 days. Finlay conveniently puts the ordinary<lb/>
limit of yellow-fever incubation between 5 and 22 days. (14) The<lb/>
efficiency of the 5-day quarantine regulation proves that incubation<lb/>
in man certainly does not extend over 6 days, or 7 at the extreme,<lb/>
and in the 30 experimental cases recorded by ourselves and Guit&eacute;ras<lb/>
the former period has never been exceeded.</p>

mosquito to the patient, and subsequently to the nonimmune, would<lb/>
develop a severe attack, such as he was anxious to avoid. One can<lb/>
sympathize with the humane feeling that prompted him to forego<lb/>
positive proof of his theory rather than run the risk of producing a<lb/>
severe attack, but it is a fact that on August 22, 1901, two days later<lb/>
than the date of that letter, <hi>I saw Dr. Finlay apply to a nonimmune<lb/>
two mosquitoes that had been kept 34 days after contamination</hi>. (20)</p>
<p>I have been impelled to look up the literature of this subject<lb/>
because <hi>I have seen several times of late the statement of Dr. Finlay<lb/>
that the Army Yellow Fever Commission has tacitly ignored his right<lb/>
of priority. (21)</hi> It is too late, after facts have been proved and<lb/>
recorded by others, to claim priority unless one can point to unmis-<lb/>
takable evidence, in print, as proof that the facts have been demon-<lb/>
strated and duly reported. In our preliminary report (22) <hi>Dr.<lb/>
Finlay has been given due credit for priority in advancing and advo-<lb/>
cating the mosquito theory. Nothing more is due to him</hi>. He<lb/>
states (21) that he had &ldquo;many years ago discovered that yellow<lb/>
fever was transmitted by mosquitoes,&rdquo; when in reality he simply<lb/>
<pb n="181" id="S8220193"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
181<lb/>
assumes that to be the case, and the facts recorded by him do not<lb/>
sustain his claim. (23) He further states (21) that his own work had<lb/>
been singularly misrepresented before the American public, and<lb/>
that &ldquo;among the facts and conjectures which are attributed to the<lb/>
recent investigators there is scarcely one which had <hi>not been asserted,<lb/>
demonstrated, or suggested</hi> by me, as the result of my personal experi-<lb/>
ments and observations.&rdquo; One can only express admiration for this<lb/>
eminent scientist's persistent adherence to his theory, but the unbiased<lb/>
observer, after a perusal of his numerous writings, must agree with<lb/>
us that <hi>while he asserted and suggested everything</hi> that intelligent<lb/>
<hi>reasoning and profound knowledge could suggest, he failed to pro-<lb/>
duce a single case of the disease</hi>. Our results have been confirmed<lb/>
by Guit&eacute;ras with eight cases and three deaths; (24) <hi>Dr. Finlay's<lb/>
assumed results have never been confirmed by a single investigator</hi>.<lb/>
In our &ldquo;Additional note&rdquo; (25) we report among other instances one<lb/>
in which the bites of 14 insects, applied 4 days after contamination,<lb/>
failed to infect, and the 7 remaining alive failed also to infect 11 days<lb/>
after contamination, but on the seventeenth day following contamina-<lb/>
tion the bites of 4 of the same insects produced an attack of yellow<lb/>
fever in &ldquo;the same individual.&rdquo; During the whole of this time these<lb/>
insects had been kept in a heated room at an average temperature of<lb/>
82&deg; F. <hi>If, as is claimed by Finlay, (26) protection is conferred</hi> by<lb/>
one or two bites of &ldquo;recently contaminated&rdquo;--two to five days (19)--<lb/>
mosquitoes, this individual, who had received 21 bites from recently<lb/>
contaminated insects, <hi>should have been able to resist the bites of</hi> 4<lb/>
of the same insects 6 and 13 days later. Should one accept Finlay's<lb/>
extension of the incubation period to 22 days infection might then<lb/>
be erroneously attributed to the bites inflicted 13 days before the<lb/>
onset of fever.</p>
<p>The Army board worked on an entirely different hypothesis from<lb/>
<hi>Finlay, who believed that the infecting agent was retained on the<lb/>
biting parts of the mosquito, that infection was direct, and no interval<lb/>
was necessary</hi>. The board worked on the hypothesis that the specific<lb/>
agent of yellow fever was probably one of that group of strict parasites<lb/>
that in nature necessarily pass through two distinct and alternating<lb/>
cycles of development, one within the body of a vertebrate, the other<lb/>
within a blood-sucking invertebrate host. <hi>Finlay believed that the<lb/>
bite of a single insect would confer a mild infection and multiple<lb/>
bites a severe one. In my own case, produced by the bite of a single<lb/>
insect, a fatal result was looked for during several days. Dr. Lazear<lb/>
was bitten by a single insect and died.(27) I became so firmly con-<lb/>
vinced that the severity of an attack depended on the susceptibility<lb/>
of an individual rather than on the number of bites sustained, that<lb/>
on October 9, 1901</hi>, at Habana, <hi>I purposely applied to a nonimmune<lb/>
8 mosquitoes (all I had) that had been contaminated 18 days before</hi>.<lb/>
The attack that followed was a mild one; the temperature never<lb/>
reached 103&deg; F., and dropped to normal on the evening of the fourth<lb/>
day.(27)</p>
<p><hi>The original theory of Finlay has been variously modified by him<lb/>
from time to time to meet possible contingencies</hi>. He now evidently<lb/>
inclines to the belief that development of the germ takes place in the<lb/>
salivary glands of the infected mosquito.(21)</p>

<p><hi>It is unfortunate that Dr. Finlay in his numerous contributions to</hi><lb/>
this subject <hi>very seldom gives exact references that would enable one<lb/>
to compare his more recent assertions with his former statements</hi>.<lb/>
In regard to his expressed opinion that the great merit of our work<lb/>
consists in our having accurately defined the danger line, beyond<lb/>
which there is a risk of producing severe or fatal experimental cases<lb/>
when nonimmunes are inoculated with mosquitoes whose contamina-<lb/>
tion is more than 10 days old (21), I desire to record my belief, based<lb/>
on experimental observation and on the results obtained by Guit&eacute;ras,<lb/>
that it is <hi>impossible to confer protection or to produce infection of</hi><lb/>
any grade, with an insect that has been contaminated less than a<lb/>
week, and that inoculations with a mosquito contaminated for a<lb/>
shorter period will be absolutely devoid of result. The accompany-<lb/>
ing tables, compiled from our and Guit&eacute;ras's cases, afford a substantial<lb/>
basis for the assertion. <hi>I deem it a duty to the service to which I<lb/>
belong, to my dead colleagues (Reed and Lazear) and to the profes-<lb/>
sion, to state the facts plainly and clearly. I do not expect that this<lb/>
paper will remain unanswered; nevertheless, I shall decline to engage<lb/>
in controversy and leave the final determination to those who are<lb/>
competent to judge, after they have carefully perused the publica-<lb/>
tions herein referred to</hi>.</p>
<p>The mosquito theory has been practically demonstrated by the<lb/>
Army commission and Dr. Guit&eacute;ras in two series comprising 22 cases<lb/>
in all. The noncommunicability of the disease by means of fomites<lb/>
has been a matter of common observation in certain localities, and<lb/>
has also been demonstrated practically by our own experiments and<lb/>
<hi>those of Havard and his associates</hi>. Yellow fever, therefore, is not<lb/>
a filth disease, in the strict sense of the term, and filthy accumula-<lb/>
tions are dangerous in this connection only when accompanied by<lb/>
sufficient moisture to breed mosquitoes under favorable conditions<lb/>
of temperature. Under such conditions standing water is a source<lb/>
of danger, within dwellings or without, and whether dirty or clean,<lb/>
unless it be kept covered or is changed every few days. Yellow fever<lb/>
is a preventable disease; quarantine, if effective, will exclude it, but<lb/>
if the quarantine be evaded and cases gain entrance to a city the<lb/>
disease can be absolutely controlled and finally exterminated by<lb/>
measures directed against the mosquito alone.</p>
<p>Carter (7) has well shown (8) that first cases are not dangerous<lb/>
until after the lapse of a number of days, for, in his experience, persons<lb/>
in direct contact with them for a few days only never developed the<lb/>
disease after being placed in quarantine. This applies only to the<lb/>
first cases occurring in a town or neighborhood. He found that<lb/>
secondary cases did not appear until the expiration of a number of<lb/>
days, varying from 11 1&sol;2 to 29, the average being 18. This interval<lb/>
represents the time necessary for the mosquito, after biting a<lb/>
patient, to become capable of infecting, plus the period of incubation<lb/>
in the person bitten.</p>
<p><hi>The greatest obstacle to the control of this disease is the failure to<lb/>
recognize the first cases when they are</hi> not accompanied by black<lb/>
vomit. Some of these cases are so mild in character that no physi-<lb/>
cian would dare to pronounce them yellow fever unless he knew the<lb/>
disease to be prevailing at the time. Susceptible persons visiting<lb/>
the house or living in adjoining houses would be bitten and develop<lb/>
the disease in near or distant localities several weeks later, forming<lb/>
<pb n="184" id="S8220196"/>
184<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
secondary foci of infection. From these secondary foci tertiary foci<lb/>
would in time develop. The diagnosis of bilious remittent fever,<lb/>
dengue, etc., would serve to cover the earlier cases until the appear-<lb/>
ance of black vomit, by which time the infection would have become<lb/>
more or less widely disseminated. Such is the history of many<lb/>
outbreaks.</p>
<p>The number of mosquitoes in infested districts can always be<lb/>
appreciably diminished by giving attention to surface drainage and<lb/>
the removal of standing water, no matter how small the quantity or<lb/>
how pure the quality may be. Rain gutters and conduits on build-<lb/>
ings should be kept clear and free; cisterns, wells, flush tanks, and<lb/>
other permanent receptacles for water should be kept tightly cov-<lb/>
ered or securely screened; privies and cesspools should be cared for;<lb/>
air vents to cisterns and wells protected by screens, and water should<lb/>
never be permitted to stand in any vessel or receptacle within a<lb/>
building longer than three or four days. Ditches and open drains<lb/>
containing water should be frequently flushed; old cans, crockery,<lb/>
etc., should be removed from the vicinity of dwellings; pools or<lb/>
ponds should be stocked with fish and deepened at the margins or<lb/>
treated with petroleum. As the stegomyia is largely a house-dwelling<lb/>
and a house-breeding insect, these and other similar measures will<lb/>
surely diminish their number and add to the general comfort and<lb/>
protection. In places exposed to yellow-fever infection all fever<lb/>
patients should be protected, night and day, from the bites of mos-<lb/>
quitoes by the use of netting and wire screens. Strict quarantine<lb/>
measures, local and general, with the isolation of patients and exten-<lb/>
sive and thorough fumigation of the localities where they are found<lb/>
will insure suppression of the disease wherever it may appear.</p>
<p>In the suppression or control of yellow fever disinfection, apart from<lb/>
fumigation, is a waste of time and money. <hi>Natural yellow fever is<lb/>
transmitted by the mosquito, and always and only by the mosquito</hi>.<lb/>
The harmlessness of fomites has been fully demonstrated by our<lb/>
experiments in 1900 and 1901, in which three young Americans slept<lb/>
<hi>for 20 consecutive nights</hi> in a room <hi>garnished with</hi> articles soiled with<lb/>
black vomit, bloody fecal discharges and urine from fatal and other<lb/>
cases of yellow fever. Three and four large boxes were packed and<lb/>
unpacked with these articles night and morning by these nonimmunes,<lb/>
who suffered no disturbance of health from these exposures. The<lb/>
room was 20 feet by 14 feet, double walled, tightly ceiled, heated to<lb/>
above 90&deg; F. and dark. <hi>Water was always present to keep the</hi> atmos-<lb/>
phere moist. Two other nonimmunes then occupied the room for <hi>20<lb/>
nights</hi> while additional articles of bedding and clothing were added.<lb/>
They slept in the garments and between the sheets that had covered<lb/>
cases of yellow fever, some of which were fatal. The result of this<lb/>
second exposure was nil. A third attempt was then made with two<lb/>
additional nonimmunes equally without success. Not the slightest<lb/>
indisposition followed close and intimate contact with this repulsive<lb/>
material in any case. Temperatures and pulse rates were recorded<lb/>
at regular and frequent intervals. Four of these seven nonimmunes<lb/>
were subsequently infected by blood injections and by means of<lb/>
infected mosquitoes. A fifth resisted the mosquito once (28) and<lb/>
<hi>declined further attempts at inoculation</hi>.</p>
<p>Yellow fever has been eradicated from Habana, one of its endemic<lb/>
homes, by the institution of measures directed against the mosquito,<lb/>

after extreme cleanliness and energetic disinfection had proved a<lb/>
dismal failure. Several cases subsequently imported into that city<lb/>
have been handled with impunity by guarding the patients against<lb/>
the bites of those insects. A small outbreak in Santiago de las Vegas<lb/>
in 1901 was promptly suppressed by Col. Gorgas by the use of mean<lb/>
directed only against the mosquito. On those who decline to accept<lb/>
such evidence must rest the burden of proving that the disease is<lb/>
transmitted in some other way before their position can be sustained.</p>

<head>REMARKS ON EPIDEMIC OF YELLOW FEVER IN BALTIMORE.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></head>
<byline>By <docAuthor>JAMES CARROLL</docAuthor>, M. D., surgeon United States Army, Washington, D. C.</byline>
<p>MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION:<lb/>
Instead of a strictly technical theme, I have chosen one that may<lb/>
be of more general interest, and which formerly demanded the atten-<lb/>
tion of two of the most brilliant minds among the early teachers of<lb/>
the university.</p>
<p><hi>Dr. Nathaniel Potter</hi>, a former pupil of Dr. Benjamin Rush, and<lb/>
afterwards the first professor of theory and practice of medicine in<lb/>
the university, <hi>held in 1793 that yellow fever was not contagious</hi>,<lb/>
and he communicated this opinion to Dr. Rush in writing. According<lb/>
to <hi>his own statement, he believed that he was the only person in<lb/>
America who held that opinion, and in 1795 he</hi> prepared to defend<lb/>
his belief in an inaugural thesis to be read at the next commence-<lb/>
ment of the University of Pennsylvania, of which he was a student.<lb/>
<hi>He was dissuaded by Dr. Wistar on the grounds of propriety and<lb/>
expediency</hi>. Dr. Potter states that in <hi>1797 Rush's contention</hi> that<lb/>
the disease was contagious was first publicly attacked by Dr. John<lb/>
B. Davidge, one of the founders and the first professor of surgery<lb/>
and obstetrics in this school, whose paper was published in the<lb/>
<hi>Federal Gazette, of Baltimore, on the 30th day of November, 1797</hi>.<lb/>
Dr. Davidge subsequently enlarged his paper and embodied it in a<lb/>
volume entitled &ldquo;Physical Sketches,&rdquo; published in <hi>Baltimore in 1814</hi>.<lb/>
On account of the importance of this city as a seaport, in almost<lb/>
constant intercourse with the West Indies, yellow fever must have<lb/>
been introduced a great many times, yet the only important epi-<lb/>
demic outbreaks of the disease took place in 1794, 1797, 1800, and<lb/>
1819. It is notable that all the outbreaks began at Locust Point,<lb/>
or about the docks and wharves, and they can be traced directly or<lb/>
indirectly to the shipping. The relatively high ground upon which<lb/>
the city stood, and the distance from the city proper to the wharves<lb/>
and shipping, explain why the interurban residents suffered but little,<lb/>
while those living upon the poorly drained, low-lying districts near<lb/>
the river were compelled on such occasions to flee for safety.</p>
<p>It can be easily shown that yellow fever was frequently confounded<lb/>
with malaria; indeed, it was strongly contended that the two dis-<lb/>
eases were one and the same, the difference being only in the degree<lb/>
of intensity. Then, while many contended that the disease was<lb/>
imported, and though their contentions could be supported by sworn<lb/>
testimony, there were others among the leaders and teachers in the<lb/>
profession who held, with Rush, that since the infection was most<lb/>
prevalent in poorly drained localities, the water and decomposing<lb/>
vegetable matter must be necessary for the generation of the poison,<lb/>
which was manifestly conveyed through the atmosphere. The</p>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>

<p>general restriction of the disease to the localities described, the<lb/>
observation that many persons who visited those localities for only a<lb/>
few hours became infected, while in other localities no infection took<lb/>
place, even among those who were intimately associated with the<lb/>
patients, proved the disease to be one of locality. <hi>With the observa-<lb/>
tion that if the wind blew strongly from the direction of the infected<lb/>
locality toward the city, that within a few days the disease also ex-<lb/>
tended toward the city, it was concluded, with reason, that the poison<lb/>
must exist in the atmosphere, that</hi> it was transported by the winds,<lb/>
and that infection could only result from the inhalation of this poison,<lb/>
which was believed to be gaseous in nature. This agreed with Syd-<lb/>
enham's theory of the epidemic constitution of the atmosphere, which<lb/>
was supported by Rush and his pupils, and which then seemed to<lb/>
offer the only explanation of the recorded observations of centuries.<lb/>
If we admit the mosquito as the sole carrier of the disease, we will<lb/>
be prepared to acknowledge that <hi>their observations were, in</hi> the<lb/>
<hi>main points, strictly accurate; that</hi> their reasoning was logical, and<lb/>
the deductions fully justified by the premises. It then becomes very<lb/>
easy to understand how the disease became one of lowly situated<lb/>
and poorly drained localities; how it was transmitted by the atmos-<lb/>
phere; how it failed to spread in certain locations; and how it dis-<lb/>
appeared upon the appearance of a heavy frost. The observation<lb/>
was actually recorded by <hi>a Baltimore physician</hi> that during the<lb/>
epidemic mosquitoes became an intolerable pest, while but a short<lb/>
time before no mosquitoes were observed.</p>
<p>How beautifully this observation agrees with our present knowl-<lb/>
edge that the yellow-fever-carrying mosquitoes can be conveyed on<lb/>
vessels; that in the warmer season of the year they will multiply on<lb/>
shore, gradually extending from house to house, breeding in and<lb/>
about the dwellings (for they are domesticated insects), and that<lb/>
they become infected only after feeding upon a patient. The impor-<lb/>
tation of the mosquito explains the appearance of this insect in places<lb/>
where it usually does not exist; it explains the occurrence of the<lb/>
earlier cases among persons who either visited the vessels or wharves<lb/>
or docks, or who lived in the vicinity of them. It also explains why<lb/>
favorable localities were visited by the infection only, as a rule, when<lb/>
they received shipping; while localities equally favorable to the<lb/>
infection, but far from the shipping, remained free from it. Of course,<lb/>
the absence of the proper mosquito explains the failure of the disease<lb/>
to spread to any extent in the city proper. This stood upon ground<lb/>
that was high and dry, and it was at that time some distance from<lb/>
Fell's Point, the location of Sugar House Wharf where many of the<lb/>
vessels from the West Indies probably made their landing. Assum-<lb/>
ing that at the Sugar House Wharf cargoes of sugar were unloaded,<lb/>
we are reminded that sugar is a favorite food for the yellow-fever<lb/>
mosquito, and that it can subsist on this and water alone for months.<lb/>
Now Sugar House Wharf was at Fell's Point, and most of the out-<lb/>
breaks began at Fell's Point, where, presumably, the largest number<lb/>
of mosquitoes was imported.</p>
<p>During the epidemic of 1794, 360 deaths were recorded. Dr.<lb/>
Drysdale reported<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> that he saw his first case just before death on the<lb/>
7th of August, at Bowley's Wharf, in the town, and on the 14th,</p>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>20th, 22d, and 23d of the same month he saw five additional cases<lb/>
at the same part of the wharf. There were also at the same place<lb/>
some other cases which did not come under his care. Dr. Drysdale<lb/>
states that there was considerable sickness at Fell's Point after the<lb/>
death of his first case, and many deaths had occurred suddenly,<lb/>
or after a short indisposition. An investigation was made by three<lb/>
of the most respectable physicians, who reported that the prevailing<lb/>
fever was the common epidemic of the season which visited the<lb/>
Southern and Middle States annually, viz, the bilious remittent<lb/>
fever. The number of cases now rapidly increased, so that by Sep-<lb/>
tember 25, in about seven weeks, five physicians were attacked and<lb/>
two of them died. The cases had become so numerous that Dr.<lb/>
Coulter visited and prescribed for more than 120 persons daily. By<lb/>
the end of the month many families had sought refuge in the country.<lb/>
During this time the city remained unusually healthy, and although<lb/>
some persons infected at the Point died in the city proper, in that<lb/>
location the disease failed to spread.</p>
<p>In his ninth letter of a series to Dr. Rush he states that yellow<lb/>
fever was first discovered at two points, remote from each other, viz,<lb/>
at Bowleys Wharf in the town, and at Fells Point. Many cases<lb/>
occurred throughout the town, but these originated either from com-<lb/>
munication with Bowleys Wharf or the Point, and the infection<lb/>
could be distinctly traced to one of those two places. Being puzzled<lb/>
to explain why the infection was confined to those two places, he<lb/>
found that the first cases on the Point were confined to houses<lb/>
whose cellars were filled with stagnant, putrid water, and he also<lb/>
found black, putrid, and offensive water beneath the stores in which<lb/>
the sick resided at Bowleys Wharf. Almost all those who were<lb/>
first affected were newcomers. Dr. Drysdale describes the Point<lb/>
as being low and flat; its streets generally not paved; its alleys<lb/>
filthy, and the ground around it marshy in many places. The<lb/>
frequent warm rains kept the noxious places constantly moist under<lb/>
a hot sun. We can easily recognize these as conditions favorable<lb/>
to the multiplication of mosquitoes, and the domestic habits of the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">stegomyia</hi> mosquito would tend to keep the infection rather closely<lb/>
confined to these localities. He further makes the significant<lb/>
statement that remittents were present from a very early period.<lb/>
It is more than probable that many of these remittents were true<lb/>
yellow fever, because under the belief then prevailing, that these<lb/>
were simply the prevailing types of summer fever, they would not<lb/>
be reported. It is also probable that if occasional cases were known<lb/>
to have been yellow fever, some physicians would have concealed<lb/>
them from the same motives that prevail to-day. He could discover<lb/>
no satisfactory evidence of the importation of the disease, though he<lb/>
states that the <hi rend="italic">Triumph</hi> arrived at the wharf about the last of June,<lb/>
with almost all the crew indisposed, and previous to this there lay<lb/>
at the wharf a schooner whose captain had died on the voyage from<lb/>
the West Indies. The fact alone, however, that vessels from the<lb/>
West Indies came up to the wharf is sufficient to indicate to us<lb/>
the source from which the infection was received. The following<lb/>
sentence toward the end of the ninth letter is of extreme interest:<lb/>
&ldquo;Locusts were not more numerous in the reign of Pharaoh than<lb/>
<hi>mosquitoes</hi> through the last few months; yet these insects were very<lb/>
rare only a few years past, when a far greater portion of Baltimore<lb/>
<pb n="189" id="S8220201"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
189<lb/>
was a marsh.&rdquo; With wonderful acuteness of observation he remarks<lb/>
that some families at the Point avoided yellow fever by carefully<lb/>
precluding all communication with the sick, and that vessels also<lb/>
preserved their crews in health by removing to a distance from the<lb/>
wharf and preventing the sailors from going ashore. As soon as one<lb/>
infected person came on board he quickly infected all or most of the<lb/>
crew. He instances one man who contracted the disease on shore<lb/>
and carried it on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Phoenix</hi>, whose crew was healthy.<lb/>
These all became infected and 5 out of 12 died. As the result of<lb/>
these observations he very naturally concluded that in some instances<lb/>
the fever proved contagious. These, and other cases cited, are<lb/>
now so easily explained by the mosquito theory that we can not<lb/>
appreciate the perplexity of the problem as it formerly presented<lb/>
itself for solution. <hi>The most accurate and careful observation<lb/>
yielded results that were apparently contradictory. All honor to<lb/>
Dr. Drysdale, whose tenth and last letter of the series was written<lb/>
to Dr. Rush in December, 1794</hi>.</p>
<p>Some further interesting references to this epidemic were published<lb/>
by Dr. John B. Davidge in 1798 and subsequently rewritten by him<lb/>
in a treatise on yellow fever, published in 1813. He makes the inter-<lb/>
esting statement that the yellow fever first appeared in the last of<lb/>
August, but the common bilious fever prevailed at Fells Point from<lb/>
June. A lady from Philadelphia was attacked with yellow fever,<lb/>
on Charles Street, and she had black vomit, but no other person in<lb/>
the family or neighborhood was attacked during the whole season.<lb/>
He noted that the <hi>disease extended in the direction of the prevailing<lb/>
winds, and</hi> that it was conveyed by a northeast wind all along<lb/>
Federal Hill and the west end of the basin. A considerable number<lb/>
of cases occurred in the city and many who had attended the launch-<lb/>
ing of a frigate (near the water, of course), subsequently suffered<lb/>
from yellow fever, and several of them died, but no single person in<lb/>
the city contracted the disease from them.</p>
<p>Concerning the prevalence of yellow fever in Baltimore at that<lb/>
time (1798), Dr. Davidge writes:</p>
<p>A physician in conversation the other day told me that he had met with the yellow<lb/>
fever in Baltimore ever since he had lived there, which is 15 or 20 years. It is vio-<lb/>
lating all obligations of decency and truth to say that it is of recent date.</p>
<p>This statement was probably correct, for every importation of the<lb/>
disease is not necessarily followed by an epidemic. In Baltimore<lb/>
and other places where the mosquito, <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi>, is not<lb/>
normally present, an epidemic is not possible, after the introduction<lb/>
of any number of cases, provided the mosquito be absent. For the<lb/>
production of an epidemic the introduction of infected mosquitoes<lb/>
alone during the hot season may suffice, because the mosquitoes<lb/>
deposit their eggs, and in a week or 10 days another brood will have<lb/>
become mature. The insects of this new brood must bite a patient<lb/>
in the first three or four days of the attack in order that they may<lb/>
become infected. Should only one or two infected insects be brought<lb/>
in and should they die (as frequently happens) immediately after<lb/>
depositing their eggs, then the disease would appear only in the<lb/>
persons first bitten by them, and these would have passed beyond<lb/>
the infective period by the time the new brood had matured. Should<lb/>
the infected insects, however, have remained alive, and should they<lb/>
have bitten other persons, at intervals of a few days in succession,<lb/>
<pb n="190" id="S8220202"/>
190<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
these persons would be in the proper stage of the disease at the<lb/>
maturing of the new brood to enable them to become infected.<lb/>
When the proper mosquito has been previously introduced into a<lb/>
favorable locality in the proper season, or when the mosquito,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi>, is naturally present, the introduction subsequently<lb/>
of a single case may produce an epidemic. The facts above stated<lb/>
will readily explain the frequently reported appearance of sporadic<lb/>
cases without the occurrence of secondary ones.</p>
<p>We can now see that the immunity against the disease enjoyed by<lb/>
the city proper <hi>evidently depended upon its high and dry location,<lb/>
which rendered the conditions unfavorable</hi> for the multiplication of<lb/>
the mosquitos that were imported. In this <hi>regard Baltimore was<lb/>
more fortunate than Philadelphia, which was lower and contained</hi><lb/>
more standing water. Hence, the mosquitos were more abundant<lb/>
and the disease spread uniformly. <hi>This led Dr. Rush to contend that<lb/>
the disease must be contagious, while Dr. Davidge held that the con-<lb/>
tagion was local, and existed only in the air of certain spots</hi>, from<lb/>
where it might be wafted by the winds in any direction. Dr. Davidge<lb/>
asserted (p. 84) that they had the most stubborn and irrefragable<lb/>
proofs, in those cases occurring about the wharves and at Fells Point,<lb/>
that the disease was incapable of supporting itself. When these cases<lb/>
were removed up into the city their virulence died with them, those<lb/>
who died; and, he writes, &ldquo;from those who recovered, all mischief and<lb/>
supposed contagion evanesced into empty air, which bore it to the<lb/>
pages of medical writers, and not to the bodies of healthy attendants.<lb/>
This was the result in 1794 and 1797.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The importance of this observation can hardly be overestimated;<lb/>
it shows the sagacity and care with which the epidemic was studied<lb/>
by these devoted men. <hi>Dr. Davidge learned the truth, and that<lb/>
truth unfortunately still remains to-day</hi> a hidden mystery to many<lb/>
of our practitioners, notwithstanding the recent absolute demonstra-<lb/>
tion of it beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>
<p>In connection with the now known mosquito propagation of the<lb/>
disease, an observation recorded by <hi>Dr. Nathaniel Potter</hi><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> in this<lb/>
outbreak of 1797 deserves mention. He tells us that previous to the<lb/>
17th of September the fever had been confined to certain places and<lb/>
to such as had breathed the air evolved from them; on that day a<lb/>
strong southeast wind wafted the effluvia in a northwest direction<lb/>
and diffused it among the inhabitants of the upper parts of Fred-<lb/>
erick, Gay, South, and Calvert Streets, who became immediately<lb/>
implicated in all the horrors of the fever.</p>
<p>In 1800 there appeared the severest outbreak the city has known.<lb/>
The mortality from yellow fever is recorded to have been 1,197, or<lb/>
about 1 in 50 of the population of 60,000. Again the disease began<lb/>
at Fells Point, on the borders of the cove, which extended from<lb/>
Jones Falls to the interior. The faculty of medicine of the city, after<lb/>
investigation, reported to the mayor that in their belief the disease<lb/>
was not imported, but originated in the cove from the stagnation and<lb/>
putrefaction of filth under a summer's sun. The first two cases ap-<lb/>
peared on the 2d of May,<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> another on the 8th of June, one on the<lb/>
9th, 10th, and 13th; then from the 22d they became more numerous.</p>

It is unfortunate that we have no detailed description of this epi-<lb/>
demic, the most disastrous the city has ever experienced.</p>
<p>A few cases are reported for the years 1802-1805.</p>
<p>The next important outbreak took place in 1819 following the<lb/>
arrival of an infected ship from Habana.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> In a letter to the editors<lb/>
of the Medical Repository, Dr. Pierre Chatard,<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> of Baltimore, writing<lb/>
October 19, cites the first cases as follows: The fever commenced<lb/>
raging at Fells Point in the beginning of July, and never ceased there<lb/>
until the end of October. It appeared also at Smith's Dock toward<lb/>
the end of July, carrying off five persons whose names are given, and<lb/>
others. The persons named had countinghouses on the dock or in<lb/>
the vicinity. No other cases appeared at the dock for two months,<lb/>
at the end of which time two more appeared. Dr. Chatard attributes<lb/>
the absence of cases during this time to the great quantity of lime<lb/>
that had been strewn on the ground by order of the mayor. The lime<lb/>
was again applied and the cases ceased. At Fells Point the disease<lb/>
raged for three months before it subsided. The greater part of the<lb/>
population retired to the healthier portions of the city, and many of<lb/>
them sickened and died there, but none of their friends or relatives<lb/>
suffered in consequence. We are told by Dr. Chatard that the<lb/>
epidemic focus on the Point never exceeded seven or eight thousand<lb/>
square feet. This information he regarded as precious because it<lb/>
demonstrated the noncontagiousness of the disease and the value of a<lb/>
local quarantine.</p>
<p>Among the most interesting records of this epidemic are the letters<lb/>
and other documents published by authority of the mayor in 1820.<lb/>
These contain the actual opinion and experiences of the physicians,<lb/>
and they show a remarkable unanimity in the belief among the Balti-<lb/>
more physicians that the disease was noncontagious. The persist-<lb/>
ency with which the infection originated and remained in the vicinity<lb/>
of shipping, wharves, etc., is generally commented on. Dr. Clendinen<lb/>
reports that his first cases were located at the southeast corner of<lb/>
Fells Point, and several of them appeared among foreigners on board<lb/>
the shipping, persons who had been healthy previous to their arrival.<lb/>
This invasion by the disease of healthy ships tied up to the wharves<lb/>
appeared to be indisputable evidence of the poisoned condition of the<lb/>
atmosphere. Of course it is hardly necessary to say here that these<lb/>
vessels were simply invaded by infected mosquitoes. Dr. Clendinen<lb/>
was a resident of the Point, and he states that his family had suffered<lb/>
from the disease and he had lost a student, an assistant physician,<lb/>
and some of his best friends. Dr. Samuel B. Martin, after enumerat-<lb/>
ing 34 of his earlier cases, with their location about the wharves and<lb/>
shipyards, states:</p>
<p>These will suffice, I think, to show the course the disease took in its commencement,<lb/>
traveling regularly along the course of the water and infecting the streets in the vicinity<lb/>
thereof. My most violent cases were near the water's edge or contracted there.</p>
<p>No mention of this epidemic would be complete without a reference<lb/>
to the little book by Dr. David M. Reese, entitled &ldquo;Observations on<lb/>
the Epidemic of 1819,&rdquo; a book which every one interested in the<lb/>
subject should read. According to him, some persons attributed the<lb/>
epidemic to the arrival of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Adventure</hi> from the West</p>

Indies, laden with coffee, while others looked with suspicious eyes<lb/>
upon the schooner<hi rend="italic">Proserpine</hi> laden with hides and coffee. Both<lb/>
vessels were ordered to the quarantine ground, but were soon per-<lb/>
mitted to return because, after a reexamination by the health officer,<lb/>
their cargoes were found to be in a sound condition.</p>
<p>Referring to the time when 1,016 cases had been reported by the<lb/>
physicians, Dr. Reese states that of all of these only 12 were supposed to<lb/>
have originated in the city. <hi>He calls attention to the remarkable<lb/>
fact that, in almost every instance where a person visited the Point<lb/>
at night the contracted they disease, while those who were there only<lb/>
in the daytime escaped with impunity</hi>. He further remarks that<lb/>
those of the Baltimore physicians who became infected suffered in<lb/>
consequence of paying a visit by night to the source of infection, or<lb/>
to the vicinity where the cause existed. Several physicians who had<lb/>
attended patients in the daytime in the very center of the infection,<lb/>
and through the whole course of the fever remained exempt until by<lb/>
visiting the district once in the night they contracted the disease.<lb/>
<hi>This accords perfectly with the mosquito theory and with the twilight<lb/>
habits of <hi rend="italic">stegomyia fasciata</hi>, the particular</hi> mosquito now known to be<lb/>
concerned in the transmission of the disease. It is also in accord with<lb/>
the <hi>experience of the American troops near Habana. Soldiers who<lb/>
visited the city only between the hours of 9 a. m. and 4 p. m. remained<lb/>
free from the disease, while among those who became infected there<lb/>
were but few who did not acknowledge having spent a night or a part of<lb/>
a night out of the barrack</hi>. Let us now consider what evidence, if any,<lb/>
collected by these closely observant Baltimore physicians could be<lb/>
used to support the mosquito theory to-day. Firstly, they recorded<lb/>
the presence of an unusually large number of mosquitoes; secondly,<lb/>
they observed that the infection was localized in the low, wet districts<lb/>
near the river and shipping; thirdly, they noted that the infection was<lb/>
contracted mostly at night; fourthly, they showed that in the higher<lb/>
and drier ground of the city proper the disease was absolutely non-<lb/>
contagious; fifthly, they reported that the disease traveled in the<lb/>
direction of the prevailing winds, when these were strong and blew in<lb/>
one direction; and, sixthly, they were familiar with the fact that yel-<lb/>
low fever was most apt to prevail when the mean temperature was<lb/>
high, and they knew perfectly well that the disease was stamped out<lb/>
by the frost. To this we can add nothing more than the direct<lb/>
implication of the mosquito.</p>
<p>Of course, a mistake was made in the failure to recognize the<lb/>
imported nature of the disease, and strong protests were written<lb/>
against the quarantine methods then in force against Baltimore by<lb/>
Philadelphia, Wilmington, and other places. These quarantines<lb/>
were established in the belief that the disease was contagious. The<lb/>
Baltimore physicians, having the strongest proofs that it was not,<lb/>
felt that they were treated with undue severity. In a low-lying city<lb/>
like Philadelphia, where mosquitoes were numerous, there was justi-<lb/>
fication for the belief in contagion, so that, while both were partly<lb/>
wrong in their opinions, under the circumstances the method of<lb/>
quarantine was a justifiable and proper one to adopt for their safety.<lb/>
On the other hand, the lax quarantine system at Baltimore was a<lb/>
source of danger; still it was justifiable on the ground of the availa-<lb/>
ble evidence to show that yellow fever was not contagious and upon<lb/>
the belief then prevailing that all infectious fevers were the result<lb/>
<pb n="193" id="S8220205"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
193<lb/>
of putrefaction. Hence, if a vessel were clean and her cargo in good<lb/>
condition, it was assumed that she could not harbor the seeds of the<lb/>
disease and she was permitted to come into dock and unload.</p>
<p>In the management of the epidemic the wise policy was adopted of<lb/>
advising all persons to flee the infected location and seek a residence<lb/>
upon high ground without the range of the infection. This the major-<lb/>
ity did, many going to the country or remaining nearby, while some<lb/>
refused to leave their habitations, and these latter furnished the fuel<lb/>
for the continuance of the pestilence. This epidemic is said to have<lb/>
cost the city 350 lives.</p>
<p>The kindly concern shown for the welfare of the destitute poor<lb/>
stands out brightly in the history of this outbreak. It became nec-<lb/>
essary to remove the healthy poor from Fell's Point and provide<lb/>
means of shelter and sustenance for them until it was safe for them<lb/>
to return. A committee was appointed who visited a Mr. Owen Dor-<lb/>
sey to solicit the use of a ropewalk owned by him. This was granted<lb/>
free of charge and the removal began. More room was soon needed,<lb/>
and a Mr. Christopher Chapman gave up another adjacent <hi>ropewalk</hi>,<lb/>
1,000 feet long, for the purpose. This was not sufficient and more<lb/>
than 100 tents and marquees were then pitched and filled. Over<lb/>
1,000 persons were received, made comfortable, and supplied with<lb/>
provisions and every necessity. The corporation appropriated<lb/>
$1,000, but this was returned, the donations of money and supplies<lb/>
being ample for all purposes. Notwithstanding the partial depopu-<lb/>
lation, business depression, failure of some of the leading commer-<lb/>
cial houses and one of the banks, over $4,000 in cash were contrib-<lb/>
uted and liberal donations of food, clothing, etc., poured into the<lb/>
warehouses designated to receive them. The neighboring farmers<lb/>
contributed flour, fruit, and vegetables as well as money, and George-<lb/>
town, D. C., contributed $700. A soup house was established at<lb/>
the encampment, and this supplied over 100 gallons of rich, whole-<lb/>
some soup daily. This enterprise was undertaken by three energetic<lb/>
gentlemen--Messrs. Stewart, Mosher, and Coale--and through vol-<lb/>
untary contributions of material and labor the total outlay required<lb/>
was only $10. The camp was maintained for 53 days, and when it<lb/>
was broken up, on the 25th day of October, each person was sup-<lb/>
plied with provisions for three days. There were only six deaths<lb/>
in the encampment and five additional in the hospital of persons<lb/>
who contracted the fever at the Point and were carried from the<lb/>
camp to the hospital for treatment. The sick among the poor were<lb/>
cared for at the hospital at the expense of the city. Food, luxuries,<lb/>
and stimulants were provided for distribution upon the order of any<lb/>
practicing physician. It is estimated that by these means several<lb/>
hundred lives were saved, and the record is one of which Baltimore<lb/>
should be proud. The mayor, Edward Johnson, was a man of<lb/>
Christian character, high courage, and strong determination. Dis-<lb/>
regarding protests, the mayor and many of the board of health visited<lb/>
the hospitals during the height of the epidemic, and by their example<lb/>
inspired others with confidence in the noncontagious nature of the<lb/>
disease. Dr. Reese wrote of him:</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson is one of the few individuals with whom, when interest and duty are<lb/>
in opposite scales, the latter will ever predominate.</p>
<p>After this disastrous epidemic a few cases occurred annually until<lb/>
1805, and perhaps later.</p>

<p><hi>Yellow fever, or yellow jack, as it</hi> is more familiarly called, is so<lb/>
far as our knowledge goes, strictly an American plague or pestilence,<lb/>
and our earliest authentic accounts of this disease <hi>record its occur-<lb/>
rence in the West Indies at the middle of the seventeenth century</hi>.<lb/>
By one or two of the older writers it is reported to have been trans-<lb/>
ported there from Siam, but this seems unlikely, because yellow<lb/>
fever has never been shown to be an oriental disease. Before the<lb/>
time of Sydenham, oriental plague, typhus fever, smallpox, cholera,<lb/>
pernicious malaria, and yellow fever were all called putrid or pestilen-<lb/>
tial fevers; it was believed they were due to the same cause and<lb/>
that they were transmitted through the atmosphere as visitations<lb/>
from God. At that time the science of medicine stood upon such a<lb/>
low plane that the best English physicians were just beginning to<lb/>
learn that there were differences between measles and smallpox,<lb/>
typhoid fever or typhus fever, and malaria, etc. Harvey had only<lb/>
recently announced the circulation of the blood and Malpighi had<lb/>
followed him with a demonstration of the blood corpuscles in the<lb/>
smaller vessels (capillaries) uniting the arteries and veins. Peruvian<lb/>
bark, that blessing in malarial fevers, was barely known at the time<lb/>
when <hi>yellow fever first prevailed at Barbados, Jamaica, Santo<lb/>
Domingo, and Martinique, and later at Vera Cruz. In</hi> 1761 the<lb/>
disease was carried from Vera Cruz to Habana by the Spaniards, who<lb/>
lost 3,000 persons from it in that year alone, and in 1780, out of an<lb/>
army of 8,000, about 2,000 died of yellow fever within two months<lb/>
after landing at Habana. It is further reported that in 1794 there<lb/>
were over 1,600 victims to yellow fever in the Spanish garrison and<lb/>
Squadron at Habana. More recently, for the 10 years from 1870 to<lb/>
1879, inclusive, <hi>11,746 deaths are recorded for the city of Habana<lb/>
from yellow fever alone</hi>. Spain paid dearly for the Pearl of the<lb/>
Antilles in both men and treasure, for, besides decimating her troops<lb/>
in Cuba, the disease followed them across the Atlantic and appeared<lb/>
in epidemic from in various cities of the Peninsula from time to time.</p>
<p>The fearful mortality attendant upon this disease is well brought<lb/>
out in the accounts of some of these epidemics. For instance we are<lb/>
told by an English physician, Dr. O'Halloran,<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> who studied the epi-<lb/>
demic in Barcelona in 1821, that the general hospital received 830<lb/>
patients suffering from yellow fever, and of these no less than 749, or<lb/>
90 per cent, died. This keen observer contends the disease can not be<lb/>
contagious, but is due to some local infection of the atmosphere, and<lb/>
in support of his contention he cites numerous instances during the out-</p>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
break referred to, showing the disease was not and could not be di-<lb/>
rectly contagious, because during the epidemic thousands of persons<lb/>
fled from the city to the country, including those who had slept with,<lb/>
nursed, and been intimately associated with the sick, traveling in many<lb/>
instances in the same carts or carriages that had been used for the<lb/>
transportation of patients, and even the dead, and after carrying with<lb/>
them the personal effects of those who had died of the disease. <hi>Still,<lb/>
no other cases followed in the districts to which these people fled and</hi><lb/>
the evidence appeared to be indisputable that the disease spread by<lb/>
contagion in certain localities within the city or its environs, and the<lb/>
conclusion was arrived at that the contagion could not exist in the<lb/>
country, but originated de novo in certain localities in the cities, as a<lb/>
result of peculiar atmospheric and local conditions. It was observed<lb/>
that the nuns of the general hospital who were thrown into frequent<lb/>
and direct contact with the sick escaped the disease, while in the con-<lb/>
valescent hospital the president, the head apothecary and the superin-<lb/>
tendent, none of whom had ever entered the rooms of the sick, and<lb/>
who had taken every precaution not to communicate with the sick<lb/>
nor with anything belonging to them, all fell ill. Of course, now<lb/>
that we know that natural or nonexperimental yellow fever can only<lb/>
be contracted through the bite of a contaminated mosquito, it is<lb/>
quite clear that the presence or absence of the disease in certain locali-<lb/>
ties means simply the presence or absence of contaminated mos-<lb/>
quitos. <hi>As we view the subject now, the yellow fever mosquito was<lb/>
brought to Spanish ports by vessels coming from Habana</hi>, and being<lb/>
a house mosquito, it multiplied in those cities during the warm season.<lb/>
It was then at hand to receive and transmit the infectious agent when-<lb/>
ever it encountered cases of the disease, and these were frequently im-<lb/>
ported. <hi>Upon the appearance of frost the mosquito went into hiber-<lb/>
nation and the epidemic promptly ceased</hi>. As the insect was an im-<lb/>
ported one it was not present in the country districts, consequently<lb/>
there was no extension of the disease from patients treated there, and<lb/>
in the cities the epidemic could only spread where the proper mos-<lb/>
quito chanced to be present. The introduction of the mosquito alone<lb/>
can have no ill effect unless it has previously bitten yellow fever pa-<lb/>
tients, and in like manner, sufferers from yellow fever are absolutely<lb/>
harmless to others unless they are bitten by the proper mosquito.</p>
<p><hi>As Dr. Howard, no doubt, told you last year</hi>, the female mosquito<lb/>
at certain periods in her existence experiences a physiologic need<lb/>
for blood. <hi>The hemoglobin of the blood seems necessary for the<lb/>
maturation of her ovums, and she will not deposit her eggs until she<lb/>
has obtained a meal of blood. The male insect can not transmit<lb/>
yellow fever, because, having no need for it, he never sucks blood,<lb/>
and while his proboscis will provide him with fruit juices, it will not<lb/>
penetrate the animal skin</hi>. The mysterious movements of the disease,<lb/>
passing from house to house, even at times when there had been no<lb/>
communication between the inhabitants; the remarkable immunity<lb/>
enjoyed by some groups of persons who were equally and fully as<lb/>
much exposed as others who were decimated by its ravages; these,<lb/>
as well as the peculiar way in which the infection clung to dwellings<lb/>
and ships, invested it with a mystery that puzzled physicians for<lb/>
centuries, and remained totally unexplained until the demonstration<lb/>
of the mosquito theory within the past five years. <hi>Even to-day, in<lb/>
our own country</hi>, where the results upon which it is based were first<lb/>
<pb n="197" id="S8220209"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
197<lb/>
published, the <hi>mosquito theory of the transmission of</hi> yellow fever<lb/>
<hi>still has many opponents, and some of its supposed friends are very<lb/>
weak-kneed and seem still to be looking for evidence that would<lb/>
justify them in deserting it</hi>. It is painful to read, in one of our most<lb/>
prominent and influential daily newspapers, the letters <hi>emanating<lb/>
from a well-known writer upon</hi> the subject of yellow fever, who a<lb/>
few years ago was looked up to as an authority and wrote for<lb/>
standard professional works, but who is now damaging his own<lb/>
reputation and retarding progress by asserting that the mosquito is<lb/>
not the sole medium for the transmission of this disease. It does not<lb/>
seem to have occurred to this widely known and most interesting<lb/>
writer that the burden of proof rests upon him, and that he should<lb/>
either remain silent or be prepared to prove by actual demonstration<lb/>
that there is some foundation for his claim. I take the liberty here<lb/>
to suggest to the paper in whose interest this writer was sent to Cuba,<lb/>
that it could hardly invest a few hundred dollars more profitably than<lb/>
to enable <hi>this gentleman</hi> to furnish the necessary evidence in support<lb/>
of his statements, if such evidence is obtainable, as it certainly should<lb/>
be if his assertions are well founded. Who would think to-day of<lb/>
advancing the old theory that malarial infection is contracted in any<lb/>
other way than through the bite of the mosquito? No one who is<lb/>
familiar with modern ideas on parasitology would entertain the idea<lb/>
for a moment, and there is no more ground for assuming that yellow<lb/>
fever is transmitted in any other way than there was formerly for<lb/>
entertaining that opinion in regard to malaria. In your own State<lb/>
during the last two years you have had abundant evidence of the<lb/>
power of measures, based upon the mosquito theory alone, to suppress<lb/>
this disease, even when that theory met only half-hearted acceptance.<lb/>
<hi>Do not understand me as intending to reproach those hesitating<lb/>
nonbelievers who were so slow to move; on the</hi> contrary, I sympathize<lb/>
with them and <hi>with their refusal to conform their ideas to all the</hi><lb/>
new theories that were being constantly advanced, then denied, con-<lb/>
tested, and recontested with every reappearance of the disease.</p>
<p>But let us return again to the scenes enacted, and the conditions<lb/>
found, where the disease has prevailed in the past. <hi>Dr. O'Halloran</hi>,<lb/>
in summing up after studying the epidemic at Barcelona, calls atten-<lb/>
tion to the House of Charity, a clean, well-ventilated building in the<lb/>
noninfected part of the city, and which was occupied by more than<lb/>
1,100 persons during the height of the epidemic. These persons, men,<lb/>
women, and children, went out daily into various parts of the city,<lb/>
some visited the sick and entered the houses of the dying and the<lb/>
dead. Among all this number, only 2 contracted the disease. These<lb/>
were treated in the Seminario Hospital, where 1 recovered and the other<lb/>
died. The one that recovered was at once returned to the House of<lb/>
Charity, where she mingled with the other inmates; still none of them<lb/>
was affected. He then says:</p>
<p>The foregoing is a true report, and may be regarded as an important one. Had the<lb/>
House of Charity been situated in the eastern extremity of Barcelona, or in Barceloneta,<lb/>
where the epidemic cause existed to a high degree, the destruction would have been<lb/>
in all probability great; but as the cause did not extend, or only in a very inferior<lb/>
degree, to that part of the city in which the House of Charity stands, the cause of the<lb/>
nonpropagation of the malady is easily accounted for. This case strongly tends to<lb/>
prove that the yellow fever will not multiply except where an epidemic cause exists<lb/>
in force; and it moreover <hi>proved that the disease is not contagious</hi>.</p>
<pb n="198" id="S8220210"/>
<p>198<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>Further on, in speaking of the Casa Miserecordia, or House of Pity,<lb/>
he states:</p>
<p>The building is low, but the apartments are spacious and well ventilated. It con-<lb/>
tained 150 girls during the rage of the epidemic. The nuns who teach them are 24 in<lb/>
number. They maintain themselves by washing, ironing, and other similar modes<lb/>
of occupation. They employ women to traverse the city from house to house to pro-<lb/>
cure needlework, etc. These women went to all parts of the city; they communicated<lb/>
indiscriminately with the inhabitants, and they were not affected by the disease, nor<lb/>
did the nuns or girls suffer by communicating with them. This is a singular fact, and<lb/>
a strong one. It appears strange that a disease which was said to have been imported<lb/>
from Habana into Barcelona, from Barcelona to Intosa, and from thence to Asco,<lb/>
Mequinenza, Malaga, etc., could not be introduced into the House of Pity through<lb/>
numerous channels of communication.</p>
<p>Again, speaking of the House of Correction, a three-story stone<lb/>
building, in which were located 100 females during the epidemic<lb/>
season, he asserts:</p>
<p>Nine of them were attacked with the reigning malady; 4 of them had been recently<lb/>
admitted as having committed some irregularity in sickly Barceloneta. They were<lb/>
all removed to the Seminario Hospital, where 4 died; the remaining 5, when cured,<lb/>
returned to the House of Correction; they communicated freely with the others, but<lb/>
no disease ensued. This house was visited daily by some of the female inhabitants of<lb/>
the city, who, through charity, brought eatables, etc., but without detriment to the<lb/>
inmates.</p>
<p>Had this been a contagious malady, the persons who returned to<lb/>
the House of Correction after being cured in the Seminario Hospital,<lb/>
which was then the seat of pestilence and of death, and to which<lb/>
hundreds were sent to die, could scarcely have failed of communi-<lb/>
cating the disease to the numerous females who had intercourse with<lb/>
them at all hours of the day.</p>
<p>Of 50 persons who were constantly employed burying the dead,<lb/>
only 2 died, although they communicated freely with the inhabitants<lb/>
of the city in the nighttime.</p>
<p>Later he mentions the lazaretto called Marine, a mile to the east of<lb/>
Barcelona and within 150 yards of the sea. It was opened for the<lb/>
sick on August 7; 79 sick were admitted, of whom 58 died; 32 persons<lb/>
were employed in various duties of the establishment as doctors,<lb/>
friars, servants, and washerwomen, and not one of them took the<lb/>
disease. Of the above number, 6 were employed in burying the<lb/>
dead, and 3 in washing the bedding. After this establishment was<lb/>
broken up, 5 women remained in it, employed in washing the bedding<lb/>
of the Seminario Hospital, but without being affected by the disease.</p>
<p>In his conclusions, he finally observes in discussing the epidemic:</p>
<p>Its fatal and malignant nature in unventilated places; the exemption of parts of the<lb/>
city from its influence, when no precautions were taken; the sickening of persons<lb/>
who observed the strictest seclusion; the sudden impression of contaminated air on<lb/>
persons recently from the country, without communication with the inhabitants of<lb/>
the city; the greater exemption of nurses and other attendants on the sick from the<lb/>
disease, than those who were simply exposed to the contaminated air of sickly houses;<lb/>
the almost absolute exemption of washers of bedding, clothes, etc., which had recently<lb/>
been used by the sick; the circumstance of the attendants in the hospitals and laza-<lb/>
rettos having generally escaped the impression of the malady; the impossibility of<lb/>
diffusing the disease in the country, where no epidemic cause existed; and, finally,<lb/>
the death of some hundreds of persons who communicated with Barcelona, and who<lb/>
sickened in the neighboring villages and country houses without a solitary instance<lb/>
of its affecting the most assiduous of its attendants, however circumstanced, are ascer-<lb/>
tained facts and convincing proofs of the noncontagious nature of the yellow fever.</p>
<p>The evidence that <hi>Dr. O'Halloran offers</hi> in support of his conten-<lb/>
tion that yellow fever is <hi>not contagious is most conclusive</hi>. After<lb/>
<pb n="199" id="S8220211"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
199<lb/>
reciting the appearances found upon dissecting the bodies of those<lb/>
who had died of the disease, he publishes a letter written by Dr.<lb/>
Salvador Campmany during the following year. Dr. Campmany was<lb/>
in charge of the Virreina Hospital at Barcelona during the outbreak<lb/>
of 1821, when, between September 1 and December 20, this hospital<lb/>
handled the bodies of no less than 8,649 persons dead of yellow fever.<lb/>
O'Halloran states that Dr. Campmany was at first of the belief that<lb/>
the disease was contagious, and when he began to take care of the<lb/>
sick he wore an oilcloth dress. The letter is so interesting that I<lb/>
shall give you the last paragraph verbatim.</p>
<p>The above sketch does not afford grounds for argument as to the contagious or non-<lb/>
contagious nature of the disease. I shall only state that out of 30 persons of all descrip-<lb/>
tions who were destined to assist the sick not one took the disorder. The nurses con-<lb/>
tinually communicated with the sick. When delirious patients escaped from their<lb/>
beds the assistants had to take them on their shoulders and replace them in their<lb/>
respective quarters. On the opening of the bodies the anatomists, in my presence,<lb/>
involuntarily cut their fingers and hands, and not one was inoculated with the yellow<lb/>
fever. When the gravediggers carried the dead bodies to the church yard they had to<lb/>
handle them a great deal before throwing them into the pit, and not one suffered in<lb/>
his health. In short, not an individual employed in the lazaretto either took the<lb/>
disorder or was infected by those who were sick of the yellow fever.</p>
<p>One could scarcely desire more complete confirmation than this of<lb/>
the subsequent demonstration, almost 60 years later, by the army<lb/>
board, of the noninfectiousness of the clothing, bedding, and dejecta<lb/>
of yellow fever patients.</p>
<p><hi>These were the opinions in 1823 of</hi> an observer who had seen and<lb/>
himself suffered from yellow fever in the West Indies some years<lb/>
before. Others, however, who were equally qualified to observe,<lb/>
insisted, and advanced evidence to show, that the disease was<lb/>
imported and that it was contagious. In short, the same differences<lb/>
of opinion and the same dissensions among the highest authorities in<lb/>
regard to this disease prevailed then as before and since, even to the<lb/>
present day. O'Halloran states that the disease was not declared to<lb/>
be the American yellow fever until August 14, 1821; that in April a<lb/>
fleet of 52 vessels sailed from Habana for various Spanish ports, 20 of<lb/>
them for Barcelona. Cases of yellow fever occurred on some of these<lb/>
vessels after their arrival in Spain, but for commercial reasons every<lb/>
effort was made to conceal them and deny their real nature. Many<lb/>
of the sailors on the infected vessels were, of course, immune, and of<lb/>
those who were susceptible the larger number had suffered attacks<lb/>
during the voyage, so that while they were lying in the Spanish har-<lb/>
bors the first persons to become infected were those who visited the<lb/>
ships for the purpose of unloading, making repairs, etc. Some of<lb/>
these vessels lay at Barcelona early in June, and we are told that<lb/>
during this month &ldquo;the bilious remittent or gastric fever was common,<lb/>
and ultimately predominated in so high a degree as in a manner to<lb/>
supersede all other diseases; and that during the month of July the<lb/>
bilious remittent fever, with hemorrhagic affection, was common and<lb/>
obstinate.&rdquo; The following sentence, quoted verbatim, is of much<lb/>
interest to us at present:</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that during this month (July) the flies and mosquitoes were<lb/>
infinitely multiplied.</p>
<p>How well this reminds us that the same unusual prevalence of<lb/>
mosquitoes during an epidemic of yellow fever has been noted by a<lb/>
number of American physicians, including Dr. Rush, at Philadelphia,<lb/>
<pb n="200" id="S8220212"/>
200<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
in 1797 and 1805; Dr. Vaughan, at Wilmington, Del., in 1802; Dr.<lb/>
Weightmann, at St. Augustine, Fla., in 1839; Dr. Wood, at Center-<lb/>
ville, and Dr. Beyrenheidt, at Biloxi, Miss., as well as Dr. Barton, at<lb/>
Clinton, La., and Dr. Dowler, at New Orleans, all in 1853. What<lb/>
interest these observations add to the now well-known mosquito<lb/>
theory of the transmission of the disease, and how well do modern<lb/>
experiences and knowledge add confirmation to Sydenham's theory<lb/>
that certain diseases resulted from an &ldquo;epidemic constitution of the<lb/>
atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would like here to call your attention to some statements made<lb/>
by a well-known Galveston physician in 1876. Dr. Greensville<lb/>
Dowell, at that time a member of the Galveston Medical Society and<lb/>
professor of surgery in the Texas Medical College, wrote of yellow<lb/>
fever, of which he was a wonderfully close student, as follows:</p>
<p>Its history shows that no ship, however filthy, can develop it while it remains out<lb/>
of its endemic or epidemic influence. No heat or moisture can alone produce it, or<lb/>
we would have it as often in the East Indies as in the West Indies and if the conditions<lb/>
in the East Indies were the same as in the West Indies it would be introduced there,<lb/>
as well as in the West Indies, by ships. Hence there must be some cause, specific<lb/>
and sui generis, that produces it. This cause, I have assumed, is animalcular or fun-<lb/>
gotic, and partakes of the nature of the grasshoppers of Egypt and the western prai-<lb/>
ries, or the smut in cereals; but these are too small to be observed with any instruments<lb/>
we now have, and have so far eluded demonstration; but if we compare the effects of<lb/>
heat and cold on gnats and mosquitos with yellow fever, it will not be difficult to<lb/>
believe it is of the same nature, as it is controlled by the same natural laws.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>
<p><hi>So far as I know, Dr. Greensville Dowell was the first even indi-<lb/>
rectly to incriminate the mosquito</hi> by pointing out the fact that it<lb/>
is governed by the same natural laws as yellow fever. And five<lb/>
years after, in 1881, Dr. Finlay enunciated his theory that the dis-<lb/>
ease was transmitted by the mosquito, but his theory was not proved<lb/>
until 19 years later.</p>
<p>O'Halloran's observation that <hi>bilious remittent fevers</hi> prevailed for<lb/>
two months prior to the appearance of yellow fever has been dupli-<lb/>
cated in the United States hundreds of times, and we are forced to the<lb/>
conclusion that there must be some relationship between bilious remit-<lb/>
tent and yellow fever. O'Halloran thought that these bilious remit-<lb/>
tent fevers were of local origin and that they gradually merged into<lb/>
yellow fever. The same opinion has been held by many in our own<lb/>
country, but this has been offset by evidence, on the other hand, that<lb/>
bilious remittent fever was undoubtedly imported from the Tropics,<lb/>
and was simply a milder form of yellow fever. <hi>The truth is that<lb/>
practically all such cases were genuine yellow fever that were not<lb/>
recognized because of the absence of black</hi> vomit, which has been<lb/>
erroneously regarded as a necessary symptom. In the work of the<lb/>
Army commission 14 cases of experimental yellow fever were pro-<lb/>
duced by means of the mosquito, and some of them were severe, but<lb/>
black vomit was not present in a single instance. This led some<lb/>
persons to the conclusion that cases produced by only one or two<lb/>
mosquitos were necessarily mild, but the experience of Dr. Guit&eacute;ras<lb/>
in August, 1901, proved the contrary. Out of seven cases that he<lb/>
produced by the bites of one or two mosquitoes, three died with<lb/>
black vomit.</p>
<p>I have purposely cited from Dr. O'Halloran's account of the epi-<lb/>
demic at Barcelona in order to show that other careful observers,</p>

<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
201<lb/>
working in other fields, have recorded the same observations and the<lb/>
same opinions as the older American physicians.</p>
<p>The literature of yellow fever in the United States shows that in<lb/>
nearly every outbreak a number of cases, usually the first ones to<lb/>
occur, have escaped recognition. This has happened from the time<lb/>
of Rush until to-day, and has been due to (1) the comparative mild-<lb/>
ness of the cases, which led to the diagnosis of &ldquo;bilious remittent<lb/>
fever;&rdquo; (2) <hi>the dread on the part of the physician attending these<lb/>
cases to assume the responsibility for diagnosing the first case of<lb/>
yellow fever, because, in the event that black vomit did not super</hi>-<lb/>
vene, the correctness of the diagnosis would be called into question,<lb/>
and the physician would <hi>be branded an enemy to the community</hi>.<lb/>
The Eleventh Annual Report of the Florida State Board of Health,<lb/>
published in 1900, furnishes an admirable illustration wherein it is<lb/>
shown that in the outbreak at Key West in August, 1899, there were<lb/>
already 11 cases unrecognized in the town before a single one was<lb/>
correctly diagnosed. Is it any wonder, then, that under such cir-<lb/>
cumstances the disease was able to gain a firm foothold? The occur-<lb/>
rence of a number of cases of the so-called &ldquo;bilious remittent fever,&rdquo;<lb/>
of short duration, should always excite suspicion, for such cases,<lb/>
when found in groups, are almost invariably cases of genuine yellow<lb/>
fever. At the present day nothing less than the absolute demonstra-<lb/>
tion by an experienced observer of the presence in the blood of<lb/>
malarial parasites or spirillums would justify any other diagnosis<lb/>
than yellow fever; and even if they were shown to be cases of malarial<lb/>
or relapsing fever, modern scientific medicine requires that, in the<lb/>
case of the former at least, the patients should be rigidly protected<lb/>
against the bites of mosquitoes, since we know that malaria, like<lb/>
yellow fever, can be transmitted in no other way than through the<lb/>
bite of that insect, if we except experimental inoculation. In the case<lb/>
of relapsing fever, of the manner of transmission of which we know<lb/>
absolutely nothing, it would be wise to take the same precaution.</p>
<p><hi>The epidemics that have ravaged the city of Philadelphia</hi> have<lb/>
been <hi>so graphically described by Rush and later by La Roche</hi> that<lb/>
one is apt to conclude that the only serious outbreaks this country<lb/>
<hi>has experienced were those occurring at Philadelphia, New Orleans,<lb/>
and one or two other seaports</hi>. It is only when we search the litera-<lb/>
ture of this disease, that we can appreciate the general devastation<lb/>
and terror created by it, and the enormous losses sustained by the<lb/>
communities it has visited. In a treatise on yellow fever by Dr.<lb/>
Samuel Brown, of Boston, which was published in 1800, he says in<lb/>
speaking of the disease: &ldquo;This is a foe against which neither ramparts<lb/>
nor intrenchments afford any security: &lsquo;It wasteth at noonday;&rsquo; and<lb/>
every principal town throughout the United States exhibits recent<lb/>
and mournful testimonials of its ravages. We will not enter upon a<lb/>
particular detail of the distresses which Philadelphia, New York,<lb/>
Boston, and other commercial places have experienced; the tale of<lb/>
woe would be too affictive for even the dullest sensibility to bear<lb/>
and the feelings of humanity would be agonized to overexcitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to show the manner in which yellow fever invades a sea-<lb/>
port town, and the mystery attendant upon its appearance and<lb/>
spread, I will quote from the report of the committee of medical men<lb/>
appointed to investigate the outbreak that occurred at <hi>Mobile, Ala.,<lb/>
in 1819</hi>. After giving in detail the condition of the wharves and<lb/>
<pb n="202" id="S8220214"/>
202<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
docks, the direction of the prevailing winds, and the degree of tem-<lb/>
perature and moisture, they state that during the previous winter,<lb/>
spring, and summer up to July 1, the city was healthy. &ldquo;In the<lb/>
latter part of July a number of violent cases of bilious fever occurred<lb/>
among persons unaccustomed to the climate, and some of a more<lb/>
questionable character; several persons employed as workmen in<lb/>
filling up one of the new wharves were taken violently ill, and died<lb/>
after a short illness of two or three days. About the same time two<lb/>
persons usually employed about Dauphin Street Wharf were taken<lb/>
in like manner, and died after a short illness. A number of carpenters<lb/>
and sailors employed about the wharf, and who were much on board<lb/>
the schooner <hi rend="italic">Sally</hi>, filled with stagnant water, and about the steam<lb/>
sawmill, where there was a pond of like offensive water, were taken<lb/>
with violent fevers, and several of them died. The physicians who<lb/>
attended these persons died, but it is stated that one of them, Dr.<lb/>
Lawton, spoke of them as cases of malignant fever. An engineer<lb/>
at work on a steamboat at the same wharf died soon after, his illness<lb/>
lasting 5 days. A man who attended him, and a servant boy living<lb/>
in the same house, were taken down with a similar fever, and died<lb/>
on the third and fourth days. All these persons died with black<lb/>
vomit, and were declared by the attending physicians to be cases of<lb/>
yellow fever. At about the same time other fatal cases occurred<lb/>
among persons whose time was spent about the river and wharves or<lb/>
stores in that neighborhood. Within a few days after the prevalence<lb/>
of yellow fever was known an exodus took place, and the population<lb/>
became reduced from 1,300 in July to 500. Of these, 133, or over<lb/>
25 per cent, died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report states that the suburbs of the town, at no greater dis-<lb/>
tance than a mile from the river, were as healthy during the prevalence<lb/>
of the fever as more distant parts of the country; and the disease was<lb/>
not known to be communicated, in any instance, to persons out of the<lb/>
town by the removal of and attendance upon the sick. Hence, it was<lb/>
concluded that the disease was only communicable in the atmosphere<lb/>
in which it originated, and even then some other cause, not under-<lb/>
stood, appeared to be necessary, because &ldquo;a number of persons fre-<lb/>
quently in the room with the sick, dying, and dead, in circumstances<lb/>
of the greatest exposure, never took the fever.&rdquo; It is further remarked<lb/>
that Natchez and other ports on the Mississippi below suffered heavily,<lb/>
and practically every seaport on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts appeared<lb/>
to have suffered more or less that summer from yellow fever. It is<lb/>
very interesting to note how the disease almost invariably first made<lb/>
its appearance in the vicinity of wharves and shipping, in parts of the<lb/>
town where surface drainage is usually more or less defective, and<lb/>
decaying wood and vegetable refuse are necessarily present. As these<lb/>
were the only special conditions found to prevail in these localities, it<lb/>
was quite generally conceded that to them the disease owed its origin.<lb/>
When vessels with yellow fever on board arrived in port, efforts were<lb/>
made to conceal the nature of the disease, and by false entries when<lb/>
patients were buried at sea, or by burial at night where death occurred<lb/>
in port, many cases are known to have been concealed. Again, a<lb/>
vessel with an immune crew, but infected mosquitoes on board, would<lb/>
infect persons from shore who visited the ship for various purposes,<lb/>
yet, there being no sickness on the vessel, she was relieved of suspicion<lb/>
and the disease was assumed to be of local origin. Cases resembling<lb/>
<pb n="203" id="S8220215"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
203<lb/>
yellow fever, but without black vomit, were called bilious fever, and<lb/>
under this guise, aided by the occasional concealment of an undoubted<lb/>
case, the disease frequently escaped detection for weeks and months.</p>
<p>In the description of the epidemic at Baltimore, also in 1819, as<lb/>
observed by various practicing physicians, we find many statements<lb/>
that must now be regarded with special interest. For instance, it was<lb/>
conceded by all that the first cases appeared at Fell's Point, where the<lb/>
principal docks and wharves were located. One observer states that<lb/>
the disease never originated more than two or three hundred yards<lb/>
from the water, and it was six weeks from the commencement before<lb/>
the disease had spread much more than 100 yards from the place of<lb/>
origin. The transmission of the contagion was rightfully attributed<lb/>
to some unknown agent present in the atmosphere, for in speaking of<lb/>
the infection it is said, &ldquo;upon this ground, then, it may be asserted that<lb/>
some matter which was foreign to the natural composition in the air<lb/>
of this place floated about with it at this time. Some portion of<lb/>
whatever this air contained was therefore of necessity breathed or<lb/>
swallowed by the people who came within its limits. And the<lb/>
properties of the foreign matter in this air must be decided upon by<lb/>
the effects which it has had on those who receive it into their habits.&rdquo;<lb/>
We have only to add the mosquito now, and the general truth of the<lb/>
above statements becomes manifest. And with the mosquito we<lb/>
necessarily include the insect's bite as an additional and at that time<lb/>
unknown avenue of entrance for disease. Conceding this, how easily<lb/>
one can explain the first appearance and prevalence of the disease in<lb/>
the localities where the conditions are favorable for the multiplication<lb/>
of mosquitoes, viz, in the low-lying and generally poorly drained<lb/>
districts in the vicinity of the wharves and shipping. When we con-<lb/>
sider further that the mosquito that transmits yellow fever is a tropic<lb/>
and subtropic insect and that, <hi>practically speaking, it is not found<lb/>
north of Mason and Dixon's</hi> line, it then becomes absolutely clear that<lb/>
yellow fever in epidemic form can be introduced into that section<lb/>
only when the presence of high atmospheric temperature and moisture<lb/>
afford conditions favorable for the propagation of this insect. But<lb/>
the yellow-fever mosquito is a tropic insect, and yellow fever is a tropic<lb/>
disease; it follows, therefore, that, given the proper conditions as to<lb/>
temperature and moisture, there must have been introduced at that<lb/>
time both the proper insect and cases of the disease. These must<lb/>
necessarily have come originally from infected localities within or near<lb/>
the Tropics.</p>
<p>In the days when yellow fever prevailed in our northern seaports<lb/>
outbreaks invariably followed the arrival of one or more vessels<lb/>
from Habana or some other infected port, but the interval elapsing<lb/>
between the entry of the vessel and the recognition of the disease<lb/>
was so long and the manner of extension of the disease was so mys-<lb/>
terious that it became impossible to trace the connection between the<lb/>
one and the other. Let us suppose, for example, in the month of<lb/>
July, at a time when yellow fever prevailed and before the days of<lb/>
rigid quarantine, a sailing vessel lying at Habana and bound for<lb/>
Baltimore. She is tied up at a dock, and numbers of the yellow-<lb/>
fever mosquitoes, which are the prevailing house mosquito at Habana,<lb/>
fly aboard. <hi>They deposit their eggs in open casks, pitchers</hi>, or other<lb/>
receptacles containing fresh water exposed to the air. The crew are<lb/>
immune with one exception, and this man is taken sick three or four<lb/>
<pb n="204" id="S8220216"/>
204<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
days out from Habana on the journey northward. He has yellow<lb/>
fever, but his temperature is only moderately high, and although<lb/>
he is deeply jaundiced there is no black vomit. The captain insists<lb/>
the case is one of bilious remittent fever and not yellow fever. No<lb/>
one could question his statement, because even the best physicians were<lb/>
unable at that time to draw the line between yellow fever and malarial<lb/>
fever, and it is not always easy to do it to-day. The hypothetic case of<lb/>
genuine though unrecognized yellow fever is bitten by a number of mos-<lb/>
quitoes during the first three days of his fever, but no one is aware of it,<lb/>
or would attach any importance to it if they knew. In two weeks<lb/>
the patient is practically well, and in another week or two the vessel<lb/>
arrives in port with a clean bill of health. There is no sickness on<lb/>
board, she is in fairly good condition, and ties up to the dock in<lb/>
Baltimore--say 25 or 30 days after leaving Habana, and with several<lb/> infected mosquitoes on board.</p>
<p>Perhaps these mosquitoes are disturbed by the unloading of<lb/>
the ship or cleaning of the cabins, and they may fly onto another<lb/>
ship tied up at the same wharf or travel along the wharf to a watch-<lb/>
man's house or some other dwelling in the immediate vicinity. The<lb/>
first cases of the outbreak may appear on the other ship tied up at<lb/>
the dock, and this latter vessel may have come from Europe and<lb/>
be in rather foul condition. The infection in that case would be<lb/>
attributed to the foul air generated by the action of a hot atmosphere<lb/>
upon the decomposing matter present in her hold. The next case<lb/>
may appear in some one sleeping or employed on the dock or on a<lb/>
neighboring vessel. In the month of August conditions would be<lb/> favorable for the propagation of mosquitoes, and in addition to those<lb/>
hatched out on the trip from Habana another brood will soon have<lb/>
appeared on shore. The mosquito may also have been introduced<lb/>
by other vessels earlier in the season, and the conditions will then<lb/>
be suitable for a further extension. The continuance of the out-<lb/>
break necessarily depends on the coming together of the imported<lb/>
mosquitoes and cases of yellow fever in the first three days of the<lb/>
disease; consequently in numerous instances only one or two cases<lb/>
occur, and none follows unless fresh cases are introduced by other<lb/>
vessels from infected ports. The frequency of the occurrence of<lb/>
cases of bilious remittent fever in American ports during the last<lb/>
century shows that during the early part at least yellow fever was<lb/>
being constantly imported, though it only occasionally assumed<lb/>
epidemic proportions. Let us suppose that the vessel leaving Habana<lb/>
sailed for New Orleans, Mobile, or Galveston, instead of Baltimore.<lb/>
Here the case will be different, because in these places the conditions<lb/>
are favorable for the propagation of the yellow-fever mosquito<lb/>
throughout the greater part of the year, and the introduction of a<lb/>
single case might prove sufficient to light up an epidemic, because the<lb/>
proper mosquito is at nearly all times present in the houses in abun-<lb/>
dance. Frequent severe outbreaks have occurred at New Orleans<lb/>
until a large part of the population had become immune, and those<lb/>
who were nonimmunes and could afford it habitually left the city<lb/>
during the warm season. Among the few who remained and chanced<lb/>
to be bitten by the proper infected mosquitoes, cases would occur<lb/>
from time to time as bilious fever, often suspected to be yellow<lb/>
fever, but for reasons of policy they were not so reported. Finally,<lb/>
after a few years had passed, confidence would be restored, and a<lb/>
<pb n="205" id="S8220217"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
205<lb/>
larger proportion of nonimmunes would supply the material for a<lb/>
fresh outbreak, which was certain to appear sooner or later. Then<lb/>
came a sudden exodus, with the wrecking of commercial interests,<lb/>
neglect of the sick, and the untold suffering known only to those who<lb/>
have passed through a severe epidemic. Here let me remark with<lb/>
emphasis that for the production of an outbreak of yellow fever<lb/>
three factors are necessary: (1) Preexisting cases of the disease,<lb/>
(2) mosquitoes of the genus Stegomyia, and (3) nonimmunes or per-<lb/>
sons who are susceptible to the disease. I would impress upon you<lb/>
the fact that the absence of any one of these factors will render it<lb/>
absolutely impossible for an outbreak to occur. An epidemic of<lb/>
yellow fever is impossible in the absence of preexisting cases, for the<lb/>
disease can not be generated by any amount of filth, heat, moisture,<lb/>
or decomposition without the intervention of the three factors<lb/>
named. Excluding experimental inoculation, the occurrence of<lb/>
cases of yellow fever is not possible under any conditions without the<lb/>
presence of the proper mosquito to transmit the infection from the<lb/>
sick to the well. And, finally, given any possible local conditions,<lb/>
any number of cases of yellow fever and any number of infected<lb/>
mosquitoes, in the absence of susceptible persons, cases of the disease<lb/>
must disappear.</p>
<p>But I am going faster than I ought. Here in Galveston you<lb/>
are in the epidemic zone of the disease; you have had your epi-<lb/>
demics, and you have reason to guard against them in the future.<lb/>
Your city was described 30 years ago as being built upon an island<lb/>
composed of shingle, and this shingle so saturated with water that<lb/>
the latter could be found at a depth of a few inches. The mean<lb/>
temperature is about 74&deg;, and the rainfalls are usually heavy in<lb/>
April, May, and June. Owing to the saturation of the deeper layers<lb/>
of the soil, the rain water lay upon the surface in pools until it disap-<lb/>
peared by evaporation in the dryer months of the late summer and<lb/>
autumn. The surface pools of fresh water were ideal breeding places<lb/>
for mosquitoes, as also were the receptacles for rain water, which the<lb/>
early inhabitants collected and used after the custom at New Orleans.<lb/>
Yellow fever paid its first notable visit here in 1839, only a few years<lb/>
after the establishment of the first settlement. The population was<lb/>
about 1,000, and the people were located mostly along the Strand,<lb/>
in close proximity to the wharves and vessels. The first case reported<lb/>
occurred late in September on a steamer recently arrived from New<lb/>
Orleans. At about the same time another case occurred on a vessel<lb/>
anchored only a few yards from her. Both cases were fatal. As<lb/>
others were reported on land at the same time, it is more than likely<lb/>
that these were not the first cases, but as they were the first in which<lb/>
black vomit appeared they were probably the first in which a diag-<lb/>
nosis of yellow fever could no longer be withheld. In this epidemic,<lb/>
which lasted less than two months, we are told that there were 250<lb/>
deaths, which means the occurrence of at least twice as many cases<lb/>
among the population of 1,000 persons. It is further stated that the<lb/>
epidemic died out because &ldquo;every unacclimated person had either<lb/>
fled from the town or suffered an attack. This was proved by the<lb/>
fact that when the refugees began to return the disease broke out<lb/>
again among the newly arrived, and there were a number of deaths.&rdquo;<lb/>
How beautifully this all fits in with the mosquito theory, now that<lb/>
we know that the bite of the mosquito can convey the disease as long<lb/>
<pb n="206" id="S8220218"/>
206<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
as two months after it has bitten a yellow fever patient. I have<lb/>
good reason to be a firm believer in the theory of the transmission of<lb/>
the disease by the mosquito, <hi>for I have seen 16 cases of experimental<lb/>
yellow fever produced by the application of infected insects, and it<lb/>
was my good fortune to be the first case among them</hi>. Among other<lb/>
experiments it was my privilege to apply two mosquitoes of the<lb/>
proper genus (Stegomyia) to a patient suffering with yellow fever,<lb/>
and 57 days later I applied the same mosquitoes to a soldier volun-<lb/>
teer, who had been kept in strict quarantine for 78 days. In four days<lb/>
he was taken ill with a typic attack of yellow fever, from which he<lb/>
made a good recovery.</p>
<p>Returning to the subject of Galveston, a few cases are said to<lb/>
have appeared in 1842, but in 1844 a violent outbreak raged for<lb/>
about six weeks, and then ceased suddenly from the absence of sus-<lb/>
ceptible persons. Here it was again noticed, however, that non-<lb/>
immunes who visited the town but once for the purpose of shopping,<lb/>
etc., occasionally returned home to be taken ill with yellow fever a<lb/>
few days later. This continued until the appearance of a white frost,<lb/>
which we know benumbs the mosquito and forces it to go into hiber-<lb/>
nation. This, therefore, affords a rational explanation of the effect<lb/>
of the first sharp frost, which has so long been welcomed as the<lb/>
savior of districts afflicted with yellow fever. During the epidemic<lb/>
just mentioned nearly 400 deaths occurred in a population of about<lb/>
4,000.</p>
<p>Three years later, in 1847, an epidemic was declared to be present<lb/>
in the month of October and there were about 200 deaths in a popu-<lb/>
lation of 4,800. In 1853, after an immunity of six years, the deaths<lb/>
from yellow fever were 535; in 1854, 404; in 1858, 873; and in 1859,<lb/>
183 in a population of about 10,000.</p>
<p>In September, 1864, the disease was again epidemic, the deaths<lb/>
being 259 and the population 5,500. Three years of exemption fol-<lb/>
lowed, and in 1867 a severe epidemic is estimated to have produced<lb/>
8,000 cases and 1,150 deaths in Galveston in a population of 15,000.<lb/>
From Galveston it was carried to a number of smaller towns, among<lb/>
which Alleytown on the Colorado River was afflicted with 200 deaths<lb/>
and about 800 cases in a population of 1,500.</p>
<p>During the same season Indianola is said to have received the<lb/> infection from Vera Cruz, and we are told that &ldquo;in less than a week<lb/>
the whole business part of the town was struck down as by lighting,<lb/>
there being no less than 125 to 150 cases taken during that time out<lb/>
of a population of less than 1,000.&rdquo; The extension of the disease<lb/>
was checked by a rapid depopulation of the town. The number<lb/>
of deaths among the citizens was about 75. From Indianola the<lb/>
disease is said to have been carried to various points throughout<lb/>
the State and even beyond. In 1870 and 1873 a few cases occurred,<lb/>
but the disease did not assume epidemic form. There is reason to<lb/>
believe, also, from the report of Dr. H. A. West, of this city (Galveston),<lb/>
that there were a few mild cases in 1897. I can find no record of<lb/>
any outbreak in Galveston since that time, although two cases were<lb/>
introduced on December 31 last, but as you well know there were<lb/>
in the State of Texas in 1903 over 1,200 cases of yellow fever, with<lb/>
nearly 140 deaths. Over 1,000 cases and 107 deaths are recorded<lb/>
for Laredo alone, and if it were not for the energetic measures insti-<lb/>
tuted against the mosquito there would undoubtedly have been<lb/>
<pb n="207" id="S8220219"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
207<lb/>
another fearful epidemic to record for the United States similar<lb/>
to that of 1878, during which, according to the Board of Experts<lb/>
appointed by Congress, more than 100,000 persons were stricken<lb/>
in their homes, and 20,000 lives were sacrificed in a single season.<lb/>
In Memphis alone, according to Keating, there were in 1878, 17,600<lb/>
cases of yellow fever, with 5,150 deaths, a mortality rate of about<lb/>
1 in 4 of the reduced population. Scenes were enacted there similar<lb/>
to those <hi>described by Rush</hi> in his account of the epidemic at Phila-<lb/>
delphia almost a century before, when <hi>the streets became deserted,<lb/>
bodies remained unburied, friends no longer shook hands upon<lb/>
meeting, husbands deserted their wives, wives their husbands, and<lb/>
parents their children</hi>. So, in Memphis, we are told of a prominent<lb/>
man who fled the city and refused to return when his wife and chil-<lb/>
dren were stricken and who still remained 50 miles away when notified<lb/>
of their death. These deplorable incidents, however, were more<lb/>
than offset by <hi>numberless instances of heroic devotion</hi> on the part<lb/>
of Sisters of Charity, nurses, and physicians who died at their posts<lb/>
of duty. As one illustration I might cite from the little book on<lb/>
yellow fever published in 1898 by Dr. W. L. Coleman, of Houston.<lb/>
Dr. Coleman was present during the Memphis epidemic and took<lb/>
down the names of 45 volunteer physicians immediately after their<lb/>
arrival. Most of them came from the Northwest, and one did not<lb/>
remain. The others all contracted yellow fever and 30 of them were<lb/>
dead within a month.</p>
<p>At that time no one could say how the disease was contracted;<lb/>
some held that it was of local origin and contagious, others that it<lb/>
was not contagious; many believed it was imported, that it was<lb/>
infectious but not contagious, and was carried in some mysterious<lb/>
way by the atmosphere. We are told by Keating that &ldquo;Dr. Dowell,<lb/>
of Galveston, says that in 19 cases out of 20 it will be found to have<lb/>
been introduced or imported,&rdquo; which was wonderfully near to the<lb/>
truth as we know it to-day.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn that <hi>yellow fever experimental<lb/>
inoculations began in the United States in Philadelphia, during the<lb/>
yellow-fever epidemics in the years 1802 and 1803. It is a fact that<lb/>
in those years Stubbins Firth, a medical student of the University<lb/>
of Pennsylvania, deliberately experimented upon himself by placing<lb/>
fresh black vomit and blood serum obtained from yellow-fever<lb/>
patients into wounds made in his arms and legs. Failing</hi> in this,<lb/>
he inhaled the fumes from black vomit, which he heated over a sand<lb/>
bath in a small room, and then, making the residue into pills, he<lb/>
swallowed them. He administered black vomit to animals, injected<lb/>
it into their circulation, and deposited it in their tissues. As the<lb/>
results of these and other experiments were negative, he concluded<lb/>
that yellow fever was neither infectious nor contagious, and reported<lb/>
his work and <hi>conclusions in a graduation thesis in 1804</hi>.</p>
<p>But little more was done or could be done until the advent of the<lb/>
new science of bateriology encouraged the belief that this mysterious<lb/>
malady might be caused by a bacterium. <hi>The first to claim the</hi><lb/>
discovery of the <hi>specific cause of yellow fever was Dr. Domingo Freire</hi>,<lb/>
of Brazil, who went further than this, and claimed also that he had<lb/>
<hi>conferred protection against the disease by inoculations with specially<lb/>
treated cultures</hi>. He was followed by Dr. Carmone y Valle, of Mexico;<lb/>
Dr. Babes, of Brazil; Dr. Gibier, of Paris; and <hi>Dr. Finlay</hi>, of Habana,<lb/>
<pb n="208" id="S8220220"/>
208<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
<hi>each of whom believed that he had found the cause of yellow fever<lb/>
in a different organism</hi>. It remained for <hi>Dr. Sternberg to show that<lb/>
these investigators were all mistaken, and that the</hi> bacteria found<lb/>
by them were not in any way related to the disease. Dr. Sternberg,<lb/>
himself, subsequently exhausted the field so far as the search for<lb/>
bacteria was concerned; he also made extremely careful and thor-<lb/>
ough examinations of the blood and tissues obtained from patients<lb/>
with yellow fever. <hi>He announced finally that his search had proved<lb/>
unsuccessful</hi>, and <hi>his work stands as the best that has ever been done<lb/>
in the study of the bacteriology of the disease</hi>.</p>
<p><hi>In 1897 the</hi> sensational announcement was made that Dr. Guiseppe<lb/>
<hi>Sanarelli</hi>, an Italian bacteriologist, working upon the island of Flores,<lb/>
in Montevideo, had discovered the cause of yellow fever in <hi>a bacillus</hi><lb/>
that he had <hi>found in about 50 per cent of the</hi> patients examined by<lb/>
him. He reported also that the injection of pure cultures of this<lb/>
bacillus into the circulation of dogs brought about an infection<lb/>
similar to yellow fever in the human being, with the vomiting and<lb/>
other symptoms of that disease, and a similar condition of the organs<lb/>
after death. <hi>This announcement naturally interested Dr. Sternberg,<lb/>
who at this time had become Surgeon General of the Army, and he<lb/>
immediately turned to an organism that he had obtained from about<lb/>
50 per cent of the patients examined by him, that he had found to be</hi><lb/>
exceedingly virulent for the small laboratory animals, and which he<lb/>
<hi>had called Bacillus X</hi>, because he had been unable positively to iden-<lb/>
tify it. He obtained a culture that had been preserved by one of his<lb/>
former assistants, and <hi>directed Dr. Reed and myself to undertake<lb/>
certain experiments with it</hi>. As Dr. Sternberg had never injected it<lb/>
into dogs, one of the first steps in our work was a duplication of some<lb/>
of Dr. Sanarelli's experiments, viz, to inject it into the circulation<lb/>
of dogs. We obtained the same effects as Sanarelli had recorded for<lb/>
his yellow-fever bacillus, and <hi>this seemed to indicate that the organ-<lb/>
isms must be identical</hi>. Dr. Sternberg then procured a culture of<lb/>
Sanarelli's bacillus from Prof. Roux, of Paris, and handed it to us for<lb/>
comparative study. <hi>It is amusing now to think of the fearful respect<lb/>
with which we handled the culture from Dr. Sanarelli's laboratory,<lb/>
because we were fully prepared to accept it as the cause of yellow fever<lb/>
from what we knew of Dr. Sanarelli's reputation as a bacteriologist</hi>.<lb/>
After several months it became apparent that this supposed yellow-<lb/>
fever <hi>bacillus of Sanarelli was nothing more nor less than the common<lb/>
hog-cholera bacillus, an organism that was much better known in<lb/>
America than abroad</hi>. Sanarelli was evidently at that time not<lb/>
familiar with the bacillus of hog cholera, for he pronounced the germ<lb/>
obtained by <hi>him &ldquo;the strangest of all microbes that are known</hi>.&rdquo; A<lb/>
bitter controversy arose upon the publication of our reports of the work<lb/>
in which we had found that Dr. Sanarelli's bacillus when fed to young<lb/>
hogs would produce the symptoms and lesions of hog cholera. Indeed,<lb/>
<hi>Sanarelli still contends in his own country that he found the bacillus<lb/>
of yellow fever</hi>, a contention that finds no support to-day among repu-<lb/>
table bacteriologists in this country or in Europe.</p>
<p>It is a <hi>remarkable fact that</hi> upon his own demonstrations alone, Dr.<lb/>
<hi>Sanarelli was awarded large pecuniary prizes and honors as the dis</hi>-<lb/>
coverer of the causative agent of yellow fever. Unfortunately,<lb/>
<hi>Archinard and Woodson</hi>, and a commission from the Marine-Hospital<lb/>
Service, working in the United States, reported that their results con-<lb/>
<pb n="209" id="S8220221"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
209<lb/>
firmed the claims of Dr. Sanarelli. <hi>In 1897 and 1898</hi>, the latter com-<lb/>
mission, consisting of <hi>Drs. Wasdin and Geddings</hi>, continued their<lb/>
investigations in Habana, <hi>and in 1899 an elaborate report was</hi> issued,<lb/>
in which it was claimed that dogs, rabbits, mice, and other animals<lb/>
could be given yellow fever by infecting them with Sanarelli's bacil-<lb/>
lus, that infection took place through the lungs, and that a diagnosis<lb/>
of yellow fever could be made by isolating the bacillus from the blood<lb/>
of the patient. This made matters rather interesting for us, but did<lb/>
not shake our confidence in our results. <hi>Bacillus X (Sternberg) was<lb/>
found to belong to the group of colon bacilli</hi>.</p>
<p>Finally, in 1900, during the American occupation of Cuba, yellow<lb/>
fever became epidemic in Habana. To take advantage of the oppor-<lb/>
tunity thus offered, <hi>Gen. Sternberg designated a board to</hi> meet at<lb/>
Habana, for the purpose of continuing the study of that disease. The<lb/>
members of that board were Drs. Walter Reed, James Carroll, Aris-<lb/>
tides Agramonte (a Cuban immune), and Jesse W. Lazear. Drs.<lb/>
Lazear and Agramonte were already at Habana, and <hi>we joined them<lb/>
there in June. Our first aim was to confirm or disprove the claim for</hi><lb/>
Sanarelli's bacillus, which he had called <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>, and after a most<lb/>
painstaking and careful investigation of the blood obtained during<lb/>
life from <hi>18 undoubted cases</hi> of yellow fever, and of the blood and<lb/>
tissues of 11 fatal cases after death, we were compelled to report that<lb/>
we had failed to find <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> in a single instance.</p>
<p>Having thus disposed of <hi rend="italic">B. icteroides</hi>, <hi>two lines of work now</hi> pre-<lb/>
sented, <hi>one an investigation of the mosquito theory, so long advo-<lb/>
cated by Dr. Carlos Finlay, of</hi> Habana, the <hi>other a study of the micro-<lb/>
organisms present in the intestinal canal of yellow fever patients</hi>. The<lb/>
former was chosen, because of the numerous points of resemblance<lb/>
between yellow fever and malaria, which was known to be conveyed<lb/>
by the mosquito. Both diseases are airborne; both are contracted<lb/>
mostly at night; both jump from house to house in a mysterious way;<lb/>
both are noncontagious; both prevail in the season when mosquitoes<lb/>
are numerous, and infections cease to occur upon the appearance of<lb/>
a sharp frost; the interval of time elapsing between the occurrence<lb/>
of the first case and secondary ones in primarily infected dwellings<lb/>
suggested the necessity for an intermediate host in the conveyance of<lb/>
yellow fever; it <hi>was noted that in a large military command at Colum-<lb/>
bia Barracks, near Habana, the only persons who contracted yellow fever<lb/>
were those who left the camp after sundown, and these, after</hi> recov-<lb/>
ery, although they mingled freely with their comrades, never infected<lb/>
them. This latter observation seemed to show that the cause of the<lb/>
disease was not present on the body, in the clothing, or the dejecta.<lb/>
<hi>A consideration of all these points led us to decide that the next step<lb/>
should be to test the mosquito theory. In the early consideration<lb/>
of this line of work the members of the board paid a visit to Dr. Finlay,<lb/>
who received them most courteously, showed them the common house<lb/>
mosquito that he believed to be responsible for the disease, narrated<lb/>
the work that he had done, and kindly supplied them with some dried</hi><lb/>
mosquito eggs for the purpose of hatching them out for study. The<lb/>
moral responsibility was <hi>next considered, and in a later conference</hi> it<lb/>
was agreed that the members of the board would themselves be bitten,<lb/>
and subject themselves to the same risk that necessity compelled<lb/>
them to impose on others.</p>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear was given charge of the mosquito work, because he<lb/>
already had had experience with other mosquitoes. I was to con-<lb/>
tinue my work with the cultures, and Dr. Reed returned to the United<lb/>
States. Dr. Lazear made a <hi>number of unsuccessful attempts</hi> with<lb/>
mosquitoes, applied one or several days after biting a patient as Dr.<lb/>
Finlay had done, and <hi>he himself was bitten by a mosquito that he<lb/>
had applied to a mild case of yellow fever 10 days before. I reminded<lb/>
Dr. Lazear that I was ready</hi>, and he <hi>at last</hi> applied to my arm <hi>an</hi><lb/>
insect that had bitten a patient with a severe attack 12 days pre-<lb/>
viously. Four days later I had fever, and on the day following I was<lb/>
<hi>carried to the isolation camp as a</hi> patient with yellow fever. On the<lb/>
day that my fever appeared, <hi>Dr. Lazear</hi> applied the same mosquito,<lb/>
with three others, to a soldier, X. Y., who was taken sick on the fifth<lb/>
day following, and passed through a comparatively mild attack.<lb/>
Scarcely more than a week later, <hi>Dr. Lazear was applying mosquitoes,<lb/>
as usual, late in the afternoon, to patients in the yellow fever hospital</hi>,<lb/>
known as Las Animas, and while thus engaged a mosquito alighted<lb/>
upon his hand. He <hi>allowed it to take its fill, and concluded</hi> it was<lb/>
one of the <hi>common culex mosquitoes</hi> which were present in the hos-<lb/>
pital in large numbers. <hi>So little importance did he attach to the<lb/>
incident that he made no note of it, and related the circumstance to<lb/>
me when he was first taken sick, five days afterward</hi>. A week from<lb/>
that date he died, having been delirious and affected with black vomit<lb/>
for several days. Thus ended the first set of experiments, with the<lb/>
death of our esteemed and unfortunate colleague.</p>
<p>Two months later a new series of experiments was instituted for<lb/>
the purpose of confirming the results already obtained, to see, also,<lb/>
whether the disease could be contracted from exposure to soiled or<lb/>
contaminated articles of bedding, clothing, etc., and to determine<lb/>
whether or not the infectious agent was present in the blood.</p>
<p>For the first-mentioned experiments an isolation camp, called<lb/>
after our deceased comrade &ldquo;Camp Lazear,&rdquo; was <hi>established in a<lb/>
secluded spot about a mile from Columbia Barracks and apart from<lb/>
any habitation</hi>. In this camp there were placed <hi>three immunes and<lb/>
nine nonimmunes, including one immune and one nonimmune</hi> phy-<lb/>
sician. A strict quarantine was maintained and only the immunes<lb/>
were permitted to leave the camp. If a nonimmune left, he was not<lb/>
permitted to return. As newly arrived nonimmune Spanish immi-<lb/>
grants could be obtained from the immigrant station at Habana they<lb/>
were brought out and <hi>added</hi> to the command in quarantine. <hi>The<lb/>
camp consisted of seven large hospital tents, separated by a wide<lb/>
interval and pitched in the arc of a circle</hi>. The nonimmunes dis-<lb/>
tributed through the <hi>tents were required to sleep beneath mosquito<lb/>
bars</hi>, and the rule was rigidly enforced. The plan was to pick out<lb/>
men <hi>here and there in the line of tents, bring</hi> them down with infected<lb/>
mosquitoes, and in that way establish the fact that cases could be<lb/>
produced at will by the application of infected mosquitoes. It was<lb/>
further desired to show that an infected house was simply one that<lb/>
contained active infected mosquitoes, and that nothing more was<lb/>
necessary for the production of an epidemic in a susceptible commu-<lb/>
nity. A new, tightly ceiled frame building was constructed, 20 feet<lb/>
by 14 feet, provided with <hi>two small windows</hi>, tightly closed with<lb/>
fine-mesh wire screens; also with two vestibules protected by an<lb/>
outer door, and an outer and an inner tightly fitting screen door, so as<lb/>
<pb n="211" id="S8220223"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
211<lb/>
to guard against the ingress of mosquitoes from without or their egress<lb/>
from within. Upon entering the vestibule the screen door through<lb/>
which one passed was closed, and the other was not opened until it<lb/>
was made certain that no mosquitoes were passing in or out. The<lb/>
lumber used in the building <hi>was tongued and grooved; the walls were<lb/>
battened on the outside and lined with white cotton cloth within.<lb/>
The walls and floor were double</hi>, and all crevices were stopped; the<lb/>
ceiling was covered with cloth and <hi>made so low that mosquitoes resting<lb/>
upon it could be captured with ease</hi>. Across the <hi>middle of this</hi> room<lb/>
there was built a wire-screen partition extending from floor to ceiling<lb/>
and dividing it into two compartments, each with a separate entrance.<lb/>
Beds were placed in each of these rooms, and one of them was<lb/>
occupied by two nonimmunes for 18 consecutive nights. The bed-<lb/>
ding and other articles admitted to the room were all disinfected.<lb/>
On December 21, 1900, the date of the first occupation, 15 contam-<lb/>
inated mosquitoes were turned loose in the unoccupied compartment,<lb/>
and then a nonimmune entered and lay upon one of the beds, with his<lb/>
chest and limbs exposed for 30 minutes. During this time he was<lb/>
bitten by several insects and others bit him again later in the day,<lb/>
when he lay there for <hi>20 minutes</hi>. This procedure was <hi>repeated</hi><lb/>
again on the following day, the last of exposure. On December 25,<lb/>
four days after his first exposure, this man who had remained in<lb/>
strict quarantine, was taken ill with a severe attack of yellow fever,<lb/>
from which he recovered. The other two men, who slept in the<lb/>
same room but in another compartment, separated from the mos-<lb/>
quitoes only by the screen partition, remained in their usual health.</p>
<p>Another building had been constructed <hi>similar</hi> to the above, but<lb/>
provided with only a single vestibuled entrance. It was equally<lb/>
protected against the entrance of mosquitoes and had <hi>two small<lb/>
screen-protected windows provided with shutters</hi>, so as to exclude<lb/>
sunlight as well as mosquitoes. It contained a <hi>coal-oil stove</hi>, by<lb/>
means of which the temperature was kept above 90&deg; during the day,<lb/>
and <hi>the atmosphere was provided with moisture</hi>. Into this room,<lb/>
which was warm, dark, and moist, like the hold of a ship in the Tropics,<lb/>
several boxes containing sheets, blankets, pillow slips, and garments<lb/>
direct from the yellow-fever hospital were placed. These had been<lb/>
soiled intentionally with black vomit and other repulsive material<lb/>
from cases of yellow fever. This room was then entered each evening<lb/>
at sundown by two nonimmune Americans, <hi>one of them a physician</hi>,<lb/>
who unpacked the boxes, handled and shook the articles, then hung<lb/>
them up on nails in the walls, and retired for the night. Upon rising<lb/>
in the morning they removed the articles from the walls, handled<lb/>
them freely, and repacked them in the boxes, where they remained<lb/>
until evening. This procedure of unpacking and repacking, handling,<lb/>
and sleeping in the presence of the soiled materials <hi>was kept up for<lb/>
20 consecutive nights</hi>, and in the meantime fresh supplies were added<lb/>
as fast as they could be obtained. <hi>On one or two occasions the<lb/>
stench drove the occupants out, but they returned again and slept<lb/>
there. They spent the daytime in a tent nearby, but were strictly<lb/>
quarantined</hi>. The pulse rate and temperature of all nonimmunes in<lb/>
the camp were recorded three times daily, and showed that the health<lb/>
of these men was not affected in the slightest degree; on the contrary,<lb/>
they gained in weight.</p>
<pb n="212" id="S8220224"/>
<p>212<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>These were succeeded by two other nonimmunes after the addition<lb/>
of more soiled garments, etc., and they in turn were followed by<lb/>
another two <hi>for the same period</hi>. Some of these men slept between<lb/>
the sheets and in the garments used and soiled by yellow-fever<lb/>
patients at the time of their death, and <hi>they even slept with their<lb/>
faces upon towels soiled with blood that had been shown by<lb/>
inoculation to be capable of infecting with yellow fever</hi>. In no<lb/>
single instance did any disturbance of health follow these exposures;<lb/>
the conclusion was therefore arrived at that yellow fever can not<lb/>
be contracted through exposure to fomites. If one stops to reflect<lb/>
that the mosquito is not able to infect until 12 days or more after<lb/>
contamination, one is forced to the conclusion that the yellow-fever<lb/>
<hi>parasite, which</hi> has never been seen, <hi>must, in all probability, pass<lb/>
through a distinct cycle of development in the mosquito before the<lb/>
insect becomes dangerous</hi>. As Dr. Howard has told you, a corre-<lb/>
sponding but slightly shorter interval is seen with the mosquito that<lb/>
transmits malaria. The developmental phases of the malarial<lb/>
parasite in the mosquito are well known and have been demonstrated.<lb/>
Judging by analogy, therefore, it seems justifiable to assume that<lb/>
the parasite of yellow fever appears also to belong to that group of<lb/>
obligate parasites whose whole existence is passed within the bodies<lb/>
of two living hosts, one of which, man, is a vertebrate, and the other,<lb/>
the mosquito, an invertebrate. This affords an explanation of the<lb/>
uselessness of disinfection against yellow fever as well as malaria,<lb/>
and it also explains the instances occasionally noted in the literature,<lb/>
where a prompt suppression of the disease followed the use of fumiga-<lb/>
tion as well as disinfection.</p>
<p>Returning to the subject of the experiments at Camp Lazear, the<lb/>
susceptibility of the men exposed to the fomites or soiled articles,<lb/>
was shown by the fact that four of them were subsequently infected<lb/>
by means of mosquitoes and blood injections. Four nonimmunes in<lb/>
all were infected by the subcutaneous injection of small quantities<lb/>
of blood drawn in the first and second days of the disease. This<lb/>
established another point of analogy between yellow fever and mala-<lb/>
ria, and demonstrated the presence of the infectious agent in the<lb/>
blood, notwithstanding that we had failed to discover anything upon<lb/>
careful microscopic examination of the blood from many patients,<lb/>
including those in whom the blood, drawn at the same time, produced<lb/>
yellow fever in persons into whom it was injected.</p>
<p>Nine additional cases were produced in Camp Lazear by the appli-<lb/>
cation of infected mosquitoes, making in all 10 cases of yellow fever<lb/>
brought about at will. All were taken sick within the usual period<lb/>
of incubation, never more than six days. <hi>They were selected here<lb/>
and there in the different tents, and</hi> no other cases occurred than<lb/>
those purposely inoculated. As soon as a case appeared the patient<lb/>
was immediately removed to <hi>the yellow fever isolation camp, a mile</hi><lb/>
distant, to avoid the possibility of any stray mosquitoes becoming<lb/>
infected from him. In no instance was the mosquito found to be<lb/>
capable of infecting in a shorter period than 12 days after biting the<lb/>
patient, and one patient was infected with two mosquitoes kept as<lb/>
long as 57 days.</p>
<p>This work was <hi>concluded by the end of February, 1901</hi>, when<lb/>
confirmatory experiments were taken up by Dr. John Guiteras, of<lb/>
Habana. His first patient was infected in <hi>February with a mosquito</hi><lb/>
<pb n="213" id="S8220225"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
213<lb/>
<hi>obtained from the Army commission</hi>, and his subsequent inoculations<lb/>
were unsuccessful <hi>until August</hi>, when he succeeded in infecting seven<lb/>
persons with mosquitoes. Of these cases, three, unfortunately,<lb/>
proved fatal. Among the latter was a young American nurse, Miss<lb/>
Maas, of Baltimore, who voluntarily submitted herself to the experi-<lb/>
ment.</p>
<p><hi>In August, 1901</hi>, I returned to Habana, and obtaining some of<lb/>
<hi>Dr. Guiteras's mosquitoes</hi>, infected two Spanish nonimmunes.<lb/>
Drawing blood from one of them and separating the serum, I passed<lb/>
the latter through a filter, which was shown to be capable of holding<lb/>
back the ordinary bacteria. Injection of the filtered serum into two<lb/>
Americans infected them with yellow fever. In this way it was<lb/>
shown that bodies smaller than ordinary bacteria were capable of<lb/>
producing yellow fever upon injection, and our failure to discover<lb/>
anything upon microscopic examination of the blood of yellow fever<lb/>
patients was thus satisfactorily explained. It was further shown, as<lb/>
a point of great scientific interest, that blood that was known to be<lb/>
capable of producing the disease was found to be absolutely harmless<lb/>
after it had been heated to 131&deg; F. for 10 minutes. <hi>At this time I<lb/>
produced six additional yellow fever cases, all of whom recovered</hi>.</p>
<p>Such were the results obtained by the Army board, and they can<lb/>
be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. <hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> of Sanarelli was shown to be practically<lb/>
identical with the bacillus of hog cholera, from which it differs only<lb/>
in the source from which it is obtained.</item>
<item>2. Yellow fever is transmitted by a mosquito of the genus Stego-<lb/>
myia, and all attempts to bring about the infection through contact<lb/>
with bedding, clothing, and dejecta of yellow fever patients have<lb/>
resulted in failure. Hence it follows that disinfection against yellow<lb/>
fever is valueless.</item>
<item>3. Yellow fever can be produced experimentally, by the injection<lb/>
of blood drawn in the first and second days of the disease, but this has<lb/>
no direct bearing upon the transmission or prevention of the disease<lb/>
in its epidemic form.</item>
<item>4. The specific germ of yellow fever is sufficiently minute to pass<lb/>
through the pores of a bacteria-proof filter, and it is destroyed by a<lb/>
temperature of 131&deg; F.</item>
</list></p>
<p><hi>Confirmation of the mosquito</hi> inoculations has been furnished by<lb/>
Dr. Guiteras, in Habana; Drs. Ribas and Lutz, as well as the French<lb/>
commission, in Brazil, and by a commission of the United States<lb/>
Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service, at Veracruz. It is espe-<lb/>
cially gratifying that a French commission from the Pasteur Institute,<lb/>
working recently in Brazil, has confirmed practically all the results of<lb/>
the American Army commission.</p>
<p>The following, therefore, may be safely assumed:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. Disinfection in the prophylaxis against yellow fever is effective<lb/>
only when it takes the form of fumigation and destroys mosquitoes.</item>
<item>2. Yellow-fever patients can be the source from which other cases<lb/>
spring only when they have been bitten by the proper mosquitoes;<lb/>
consequently, in the yellow-fever zone all acute febrile cases not<lb/>
diagnosed should be handled as though they were yellow fever, and<lb/>
should be kept rigidly behind safe mosquito screens and netting.<lb/>
So far as has been shown the yellow-fever patient is dangerous when<lb/>
bitten by mosquitoes <hi>during the first three or four days</hi> of the fever<lb/>
<pb n="214" id="S8220226"/>
214<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
only, but since relapses may occur, every precaution should be<lb/>
maintained as long as the temperature remains elevated.</item>
<item>3. The hospitals intended for the treatment of suspected cases of<lb/>
yellow fever should be located upon ground that is high, well drained,<lb/>
away from creeks, pools, or standing water of any kind, free from<lb/>
mosquitos, and not surrounded by grass or shrubbery. All entrances<lb/>
and exits to such hospitals should be provided with close-meshed<lb/>
wire screen spring doors, and similar screens should be fixed immov-<lb/>
ably over every window and other opening communicating with the<lb/>
exterior. Standing water should not be permitted in barrels or<lb/>
vessels of any kind, and broken crockery, tin cans, or other possible<lb/>
retainers of rain water should be systematically searched for within<lb/>
a radius of several hundred yards, and removed.</item>
<item>4. In general sanitation, all surface pools should be promptly<lb/>
drained and filled in with gravel, or covered with petroleum. Petro-<lb/>
leum should be applied systematically to standing water in all ditches,<lb/>
pools, rain-water gutters, etc., that can not be filled up or emptied.<lb/>
The margins of ponds should be deepened, to enable the fish to reach<lb/>
mosquito larv&aelig;.</item>
<item>5. Water should not be permitted to stand uncovered in houses;<lb/>
and rain water in cisterns or barrels, when not used for drinking<lb/>
purposes, should be treated with petroleum; if the water is used for<lb/>
drinking, all openings, vents, etc., should be closed with wire screens<lb/>
or tightly fitting covers. Periodic examinations should then be<lb/>
made for wigglers (larv&aelig;) or mosquitoes, because the female mosquito<lb/>
may pass through a very minute opening when seeking water on<lb/>
which to deposit her eggs. By means of these and other similar<lb/>
measures, the number of mosquitoes may be greatly reduced, and the<lb/>
chances for the conveyance of the infection, should it happen to be<lb/>
present, will be thereby greatly diminished.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia fasciata</hi>, the yellow-fever mosquito, is a house-dwelling<lb/>
and house-breeding insect; particular attention should therefore be<lb/>
paid to the smallest as well as the larger collections of standing water<lb/>
within and about habitations.</item>
<item>6. After the removal of a patient, his room and the adjoining ones<lb/>
should be at once tightly closed by pasting paper over all cracks and<lb/>
openings, and then fumigated with insect powder, tobacco, or sulphur,<lb/>
to destroy mosquitoes. When the room is opened after a few hours<lb/>
these should be swept up and burned.</item>
<item>7. Experience at Habana has shown that patients suffering from<lb/>
yellow fever upon their arrival at a port can be carried through a<lb/>
thickly populated city to a properly screened hospital, and there<lb/>
treated without the slightest danger to the community, so long as<lb/>
they are rigidly protected against mosquitoes. Money spent for the<lb/>
purpose of disinfection against yellow fever is wasted, for yellow<lb/>
fever in epidemic form can only be contracted <hi>through the bites of<lb/>
mosquitoes of a single genus</hi>.</item>
<item>8. The noncontagiousness of yellow fever was clearly shown in<lb/>
certain localities years ago before the use of disinfectants, in places<lb/>
where the yellow-fever mosquito did not exist. The belief in the<lb/>
supposed contagiousness of this disease arose from its transmission<lb/>
through the atmosphere by the mosquito at a time when this insect<lb/>
was not suspected or known to be concerned in the transmission of<lb/>
any disease.<lb/>
<pb n="215" id="S8220227"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
215</item>
<item>9. When a house is infected with yellow fever, it simply contains<lb/>
infected mosquitoes; in the absence of this insect, no amount of<lb/>
filth, heat, or moisture is capable of generating the disease.</item>
<item>10. Vessels from infected localities should be compelled, upon<lb/>
entering port, to anchor at least a fourth of a mile from shore; they<lb/>
should never be permitted to tie up to a wharf or dock in the city,<lb/>
except in northern latitudes during the cold season of the year. In<lb/>
this way, the chances for contaminated mosquitoes reaching the city<lb/>
can be reduced to a minimum.</item>
<item>11. <hi>As the yellow-fever mosquito does not bite, as a rule, between</hi><lb/>
the <hi>hours of 9 a. m. and 3 p. m.</hi>, it is practically safe for nonimmunes<lb/>
to visit infected localities between these hours for the transaction of<lb/>
business. Before 9 a. m. and after 3 p. m. they will run a greater<lb/>
or lesser risk of being infected.</item>
<item>12. It is now <hi>certain that before the lapse of many years</hi>, the dis-<lb/>
ease, yellow fever, <hi>will have become extinct</hi>. The length of time<lb/>
necessary for its complete eradication will depend upon the readiness<lb/>
of our southern neighbors to accept the mosquito theory in toto,<lb/>
and institute in their infected seaports vigorous and energetic meas-<lb/>
ures based upon it.</item>
<item>13. Another epidemic of yellow fever should never be seen in the<lb/>
United States. An example has been shown in Cuba, and the meas-<lb/>
ures necessary to prevent the extension of the disease are so simple,<lb/>
so plain and practicable for persons in authority, that the existence<lb/>
of an epidemic of yellow fever in our country should alone be regarded<lb/>
as prima facie evidence of the culpability of some responsible person.</item>
</list></p>
<p>In conclusion, I can not refrain from asking you to pay no atten-<lb/>
tion to the <hi>sensational letters, already referred to, as recently pub-<lb/>
lished from a well-known American physician on the island of Cuba</hi>.<lb/>
This gentleman was at one time regarded as an authority upon yellow<lb/>
fever, of which he has seen a great deal, but he is <hi>now five years</hi><lb/>
behind the time. His insinuation that cases of yellow fever are still<lb/>
frequent in Cuba, and that they are called typhoid fever, is a scan-<lb/>
dalous misrepresentation of the actual truth, and an unjustifiable<lb/>
reflection upon the intelligence and zeal of Cuban physicians, like<lb/>
Drs. Finlay, Guiteras, Agramonte, Albertini, and others, who realize<lb/>
fully the responsibility that rests upon them, who have suppressed<lb/>
yellow fever on the island for three years, and who are fully compe-<lb/>
tent to deal with the situation there, now and in the future.</p>

<head>LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM THE PRESENT OUTBREAK OF<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER IN LOUISIANA.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></head>
<byline>By <docAuthor>JAMES CARROLL</docAuthor>, M. D., Assistant Surgeon, United States Army, Washington, D. C.</byline>
<p>The present seems to be a suitable occasion to invite attention to<lb/>
several points in connection with the epidemic occurrence of yellow<lb/>
fever in the United States at the present as well as at other times.<lb/>
In the discussion of the symposium on yellow fever at the meeting of<lb/>
the American Public Health Association in Washington in 1903, I<lb/>
called attention <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> to the necessity during the epidemic season for<lb/>
requiring physicians, in cities where yellow fever is prevailing or<lb/>
likely to prevail, to report promptly to the authorities all cases of<lb/>
fever of any kind coming to their notice. This is necessary in order<lb/>
that there may be no delay in the institution of proper measures to<lb/>
protect the community against extension of the disease if it be yellow<lb/>
fever, for this extension will almost surely take place in the more<lb/>
southern latitudes if the patients are not protected from mosquitoes<lb/>
at the outset. If all cases of undetermined fever were promptly<lb/>
reported and at once protected from mosquitoes <hi rend="superscript">3</hi> it would hardly<lb/>
be possible for the disease to spread if it were yellow fever; on the<lb/>
other hand, where the physician waits for the appearance of black<lb/>
vomit, the golden opportunity passes by, for it has been shown that<lb/>
in practically all cases the disease can not be communicated after<lb/>
the fourth day of the fever. For this reason the diagnosis should be<lb/>
anticipated, and all febrile patients should be immediately protected<lb/>
from mosquitoes until it is shown by actual demonstration that they<lb/>
are not suffering from this disease. Epidemics do not follow every<lb/>
introduction of yellow fever; mosquitoes becoming infected may<lb/>
die before they bite a nonimmune, or the patients may happen to be<lb/>
treated in a locality free from Stegomyia. A group of cases of yellow<lb/>
fever occurring without black vomit usually receives the designation<lb/>
bilious remittent fever, a diagnosis that should be erased from our<lb/>
text books. <hi>Bilious remittent fever, acute in type and of short dura-<lb/>
tion, appearing in the United States, is yellow fever, and it should<lb/>
be so regarded</hi>. Bilious remittent fever was formerly regarded as a<lb/>
type of malarial remittent, but that was before the use of the micro-<lb/>
scope was found to be necessary for a positive diagnosis of malarial<lb/>
infection. We know now that malarial fever is not a disease of cities,<lb/>
but of outlying districts, while the bilious remittent fever, so called,<lb/>
has been recorded in the cities, in epidemic form, and in such intimate<lb/>
association with yellow fever that by some the diseases were declared<lb/>
identical, and by others the latter was said to be only a modification</p>

<p>of the former. Most interesting and important in this connection is<lb/>
the statement cited by La Roche,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> in his chapter on bilious remittent<lb/>
fever, that &ldquo;the morbid appearances revealed on dissection are the<lb/>
same in remittent as in yellow fevers.&rdquo; This statement, however,<lb/>
was not wholly accepted by him, for he calls attention to the bronzed<lb/>
appearance of the liver in certain remittents, a condition that we<lb/>
know results only from malarial pigmentation. Now that we can so<lb/>
easily differentiate malarial remittent and typhoid from yellow fever,<lb/>
the diagnosis is much less difficult, except where yellow fever occurs<lb/>
as a complicating infection.</p>
<p>Our confreres in Havana have demonstrated to us that it is pos-<lb/>
sible to prevent the epidemic occurrence of yellow fever, while occa-<lb/>
sionally admitting cases of the disease into the heart of a city in which<lb/>
the climatic and other conditions are known to be most favorable for<lb/>
its extension in epidemic form, and in which there are more suscep-<lb/>
tible persons now than ever before. The method suggested here is in<lb/>
many respects similar to, and is based on, the one adopted during the<lb/>
American occupation of Havana.</p>
<p>Since then it has been sufficiently demonstrated, in 1903 and again<lb/>
in 1905, that under the lax system heretofore and now in vogue,<lb/>
yellow fever can easily secure a firm foothold in certain of the south-<lb/>
ern states and escape recognition until it has passed almost com-<lb/>
pletely beyond control. On both occasions cited, the outbreak was<lb/>
suppressed or limited only by the intervention of the General Govern-<lb/>
ment, which, through the energetic action of the United States<lb/>
Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service, finally succeeded in<lb/>
checking two epidemics that threatened to become little less than<lb/>
national calamities. Great credit is due to those officials for the<lb/>
success that was attained in spite of the extreme delicacy of the<lb/>
situation and the passive opposition encountered from many quarters.</p>
<p>Our experiences in Cuba have shown that for the exclusion and<lb/>
suppression of yellow fever absolute hygienic control is necessary<lb/>
not only of the people at large, but of the patients as well, and espe-<lb/>
cially of the practicing physicians. The aim of modern medicine is<lb/>
the prevention of disease rather than its cure, and the safety and<lb/>
welfare of the thousands of persons exposed demand that the proper<lb/>
measures be instituted and rigidly enforced. No valid argument can<lb/>
be brought forward to show why the United States should not be kept<lb/>
as free from outbreaks of yellow fever as the city of Havana, its former<lb/>
endemic home, has been during the past four years.</p>
<p>To attain this result the following requirements seem to be essential:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. Our physicians, or at least those who are in control, must dis-<lb/>
abuse their minds of the impression that black vomit necessarily<lb/>
occurs in the majority of cases of yellow fever.</item>
<item>2. During the epidemic season, viz, from about May 1 to October<lb/>
31, and in the epidemic zone, physicians should be required to report<lb/>
to the health authorities, immediately, all cases of fever of any kind<lb/>
that come under their observation, whether among their patients or<lb/>
not, and failure to do so should be made punishable under the law.</item>
<item>3. The board of health should be authorized to appoint, with<lb/>
proper compensation, a commission of three experts, all of whom<lb/>
should be men of high reputation as diagnosticians. It should be the</item>

<item>duty of this commission to visit without delay all cases of fever<lb/>
reported to the health authorities, and the onus of diagnosis should<lb/>
rest on the commission and not on the attending physicians. They<lb/>
(the commission) should visit each patient daily until the diagnosis<lb/>
is established or the patient sent to hospital, and they should for-<lb/>
ward promptly to the health department a written report at each<lb/>
visit. The commission should determine whether or not the patient<lb/>
shall be treated as a possible case of yellow fever, and their decision<lb/>
should be final and obligatory on all concerned.</item>
<item>4. All patients presenting the symptoms of yellow fever, and all<lb/>
cases not diagnosed but remaining under suspicion, should be<lb/>
promptly removed for treatment to a hospital especially located and<lb/>
provided with wire screens and mosquito nets, and the whole or a<lb/>
portion of which has been set apart for that purpose. The yellow<lb/>
fever wards or hospital should be under the direct control of the<lb/>
senior diagnosis commission, and the patients should be treated by<lb/>
physicians appointed only on their recommendation and acting under<lb/>
their direction.</item>
<item>5. In exceptional cases, to be determined by the commission,<lb/>
patients under observation awaiting diagnosis could be treated in<lb/>
their homes beneath mosquito netting, and in rooms properly pro-<lb/>
tected with wire screens, until the nature of the case had been finally<lb/>
settled to the satisfaction of the commission.</item>
<item>The commission and not the attending physician should be held<lb/>
responsible for the enforcement of all clinical measures necessary for<lb/>
the protection of the community, and they should be empowered to<lb/>
employ such help as seemed in their judgment to be required. They<lb/>
should also be assisted at times by subcommissions appointed on their<lb/>
recommendation.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Under such a system, conscientiously carried out, the occurrence<lb/>
of an epidemic of yellow fever in any city would become an impossi-<lb/>
bility. Objection can not be made on the ground of expense if the<lb/>
members of the diagnosis commission are paid only for every visit<lb/>
to a patient; under such an arrangement the cost to the city would<lb/>
be trifling when compared with the losses now sustained by indi-<lb/>
viduals and the whole community through the failure of practicing<lb/>
physicians to recognize and report mild cases of the disease. And<lb/>
herein lies the crucial point. The diagnosis must be anticipated<lb/>
and the proper precautionary measures be taken before the disease<lb/>
has fully declared itself. Diagnoses of malarial remittent, and above<lb/>
all of bilious remittent fever, must not be accepted as conclusive<lb/>
until the presence of malarial or other parasites has been demonstrated<lb/>
to the satisfaction of the members of the diagnosis commission.<lb/>
Attention was called two years ago <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> to the fact that over and over<lb/>
again, since the time of Benjamin Rush, yellow fever has stalked<lb/>
abroad in our cities, unrecognized, under the guise of bilious remittent<lb/>
fever. The time has come when a diagnosis of <hi>bilious remittent<lb/>
fever should no longer be accepted, for there is no such disease perse</hi>.<lb/>
We may have malarial fever complicated with jaundice, but this<lb/>
should not change the diagnosis of malaria any more than an accom-<lb/>
panying icterus would change a diagnosis of typhoid fever. Simi-<lb/>
larly a complication of malaria no longer justifies the diagnosis of<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
219<lb/>
typho-malarial fever, and that term has properly been discarded.<lb/>
In numerous instances it is stated in the records of the older epidemics<lb/>
of yellow fever that the disease was preceded by, or began as, a bilious<lb/>
remittent fever, just as in more recent times physicians have believed<lb/>
that typhoid fever began as malarial fever. The conclusion is<lb/>
equally untenable in both cases, and the deduction is obvious that<lb/>
cases of so-called bilious remittent fever must be regarded and treated<lb/>
as cases of yellow fever, unless a satisfactory specific cause for the<lb/>
condition can be demonstrated beyond a doubt. It is proper to<lb/>
mention here that in every one of the 22 cases of yellow fever pur-<lb/>
posely inoculated by the Army Board in Cuba, a diagnosis of bilious<lb/>
remittent fever would have been justified if it had not been known<lb/>
that they were produced from true cases of yellow fever, for, although<lb/>
some of them were severe, <hi>black vomit was absent from all</hi>.</p>
<p>It may seem unnecessarily severe to require physicians, under a<lb/>
penalty, to report all cases of fever coming under their observation,<lb/>
but no other means will attain the desired result, and the enormous<lb/>
interests at stake demand that the methods instituted be thorough<lb/>
and that they be rigidly carried out. The appointment of a board of<lb/>
diagnosis, as has been suggested, will relieve the attending physician<lb/>
from the odium that accompanies a diagnosis of yellow fever in a<lb/>
doubtful case, and the board, fully appreciating the responsibility<lb/>
that rests on them, may be relied on to do their duty. During the dis-<lb/>
cussion on yellow fever before the American Public Health Associa-<lb/>
tion at its meeting in Washington two years ago, already referred to<lb/>
in <hi>my remarks, which were badly misquoted,</hi><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> I urged the necessity<lb/>
for requiring physicians, under a penalty, to report all cases of fever,<lb/>
in order that they might be examined by a board of experts (as was<lb/>
done in Cuba) and treated as cases of yellow fever until the diagnosis<lb/>
was established. Only last month, in a conversation on this subject<lb/>
with a physician from a large city in Texas, he laughingly remarked:<lb/>
&ldquo;We never report our cases of yellow fever until we have about a dozen<lb/>
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present epidemic in and about New Orleans only serves to em-<lb/>
phasize the necessity for such regulations as are here suggested, and this<lb/>
necessity is further emphasized by the statement in the public press<lb/>
of September 5 that &ldquo;Inspector Brady attributed the continued spread<lb/>
of the disease to the unwillingness or inability of physicians to diag-<lb/>
nose mild cases of yellow fever, and that physicians of standing and<lb/>
ability look for black vomit before making a diagnosis.&rdquo; We have else-<lb/>
where <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> cited the occurrence of the same difficulty at Key West in 1889,<lb/>
and we again assert that these physicians may be thoroughly con-<lb/>
scientious and able men, but they are baffled by the differences between<lb/>
the aspects of the disease as they actually find it and as they have been<lb/>
taught by the best authorities to expect to find it. It is the manifest<lb/>
duty of local health authorities, therefore, to relieve the physician of<lb/>
the burden of diagnosis and to leave that and the adoption of protec-<lb/>
tive measures to the board of expert diagnosticians.</p>
<p>In this connection I beg to be permitted to call attention to the<lb/>
present situation at Jackson Barracks, a station of two batteries of<lb/>
Coast Artillery, in New Orleans. By the seventh day of the present</p>

YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>month a number of cases of yellow fever had appeared in the neighbor-<lb/>
hood and seven of them in a block that approached within 100 feet of<lb/>
the officer's quarters. Still the garrison has not been removed and up<lb/>
to the present time no single case has occurred among them; even<lb/>
should a case or two appear an epidemic is not feared. The reason<lb/>
for this is simply that the medical officers know that it is absolutely<lb/>
within their power to prevent any epidemic extension of the disease;<lb/>
they are constantly on the alert, and all cases of fever are handled in<lb/>
the beginning as though they might be yellow fever.</p>
<p>Again, at Fort McIntosh, in Laredo, Tex., in 1903, there were only<lb/>
5 cases of yellow fever in a command of 111 officers and men, while<lb/>
in the town alongside them over 1,000 cases and more than 100 deaths<lb/>
occurred. It was found that the 5 men who became infected had<lb/>
violated orders by visiting the town at night without wearing the<lb/>
prescribed mosquito head-nets, leather gauntlets, and leggings.</p>
<p>If, in the presence of cases of yellow fever among and around them,<lb/>
garrisons of soldiers can be protected from the infection in anything<lb/>
like epidemic form, it necessarily follows that the same measures and<lb/>
the same degree of vigilance will protect a community, provided the<lb/>
physicians do their full duty and they are properly assisted by the<lb/>
authorities. The subject is one involving the lives and interests of<lb/>
thousands of innocent persons, and the secret of success lies in eternal<lb/>
vigilance, with the determination to allow no case, however mild and<lb/>
doubtful, to escape the fullest precautions.</p>

<head>PART IV.--REPORTS FROM SANITARY OFFICERS IN HABANA, CUBA,<lb/>
DEMONSTRATING THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF THE SCIENTIFIC<lb/>
FINDINGS OF MAJ. REED AND HIS ASSOCIATES ON THE YELLOW-<lb/>
FEVER COMMISSION.<lb/>
----------</head>
<head>CHAPTER 1.</head>
<head>SANITATION AND YELLOW FEVER IN HABANA.</head>
<p>HEADQUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF CUBA,<lb/>
OFFICE OF CHIEF SURGEON,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Havana, February 8, 1901</hi>.</p>
<p>The ADJUTANT GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>YELLOW FEVER, ESPECIALLY FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE SANI-<lb/>
TARIAN.</p>
<p>Yellow fever has played such a conspicuous and important part in<lb/>
the mortality of Habana that it deserves special consideration. This<lb/>
infectious disease may <hi>claim Habana as one of its oldest and most<lb/>
favored haunts</hi>. It was here as early as 1720, if, as I believe, we are<lb/>
justified in so regarding the outbreak of that date described by the<lb/>
historian Pezuela, apparently imported from Vera Cruz. It there-<lb/>
after broke out in occasional epidemics like the historic, ones of 1749<lb/>
<hi>and 1762, the latter being particularly fatal to the Anglo-American<lb/>
army which had just captured the city, and causing the conquerors<lb/>
to relinquish their prize in 1763</hi>. From that day to this yellow fever<lb/>
has been endemic in Habana, hardly noticeable in some years, a mere<lb/>
smouldering fire when nonimmunes were few, but quickly lighting<lb/>
up into a blaze as soon as the <hi>fuel of immigration</hi> came within its<lb/>
reach. The result has been a thoroughly infected city, a source of<lb/>
<hi>danger</hi> not only to its own inhabitants and the rest of Cuba, but as<lb/>
well <hi>to all countries having commercial relations with</hi> it.</p>
<p>During the decade 1890--99, the recorded number of deaths was<lb/>
4,831, giving an annual average of 483, with a wide range from 1,282<lb/>
in 1896 to 103 in 1899. <hi>In 1900 the number of deaths was 310</hi>.<lb/>
Thus yellow fever is not nearly as fatal in Habana as typhoid fever in<lb/>
the United States, and its importance would seem to have been very<lb/>
much exaggerated, did we not realize that its mortality is not fur-<lb/>
nished by the whole population, but only a small proportion thereof,<lb/>
that is, the nonimmunes probably never averaging more than 1<lb/>
in 10.</p>
<p>Until a few months ago the mode of propagation of yellow fever<lb/>
was uncertain; we were fighting an unknown enemy in the dark, an<lb/>
221<lb/>
<pb n="222" id="S8220236"/>
222<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
<hi>enemy so wily and elusive that we never knew to what extent our<lb/>
clumsy and expensive methods of warfare were successful</hi>. But,<lb/>
very recently, much light has been thrown upon the subject as the<lb/>
result of <hi>one of the most brilliant medical discoveries of the age</hi>. The<lb/>
announcement long ago made by Dr. Carlos Finlay, of Habana, that<lb/>
mosquitoes were the agent of transmission in yellow fever has been<lb/>
verified and scientifically demonstrated by Maj. Walter Reed, Sur-<lb/>
geon, United States Army, and his colleagues, in the most conclusive<lb/>
manner. It is true that the germ itself, in spite of the claims of<lb/>
Sanarelli and his partisans, has not yet been isolated, but this is of<lb/>
comparatively little moment to the sanitarian, more concerned with<lb/>
prevention than cure. For our purpose, the mosquito is the enemy,<lb/>
and all our efforts must be directed against it. This war should be<lb/>
waged with a twofold object: the destruction of the malaria-bearing<lb/>
anopheles and that of the yellow-fever bearing culex; thus, at the<lb/>
same time, eradicating the two diseases which have contributed so<lb/>
much to <hi>make Habana a byword of reproach among civilized nations</hi>.<lb/>
Practically, then, the problem consists: First, in finding the haunts<lb/>
and breeding places of mosquitoes and the best means of extinguishing<lb/>
them; second, in carefully protecting yellow-fever patients and all non-<lb/>
immunes with mosquito bars, so that mosquitoes may not be infected<lb/>
by the former and carry the infection to the latter; third, in isolating<lb/>
patients, and also, as much as is possible, nonimmunes, so that mos-<lb/>
quitoes biting the former may not be able to reach the latter. The<lb/>
knowledge that <hi>mosquitoes do not travel far, seldom more than a few<lb/>
hundred feet if shelter exists</hi>, and that <hi>each house practically breeds<lb/>
its own, simplifies the question</hi>. The data being thus plainly stated,<lb/>
there does not appear to be insurmountable obstacles in the way, and<lb/>
we may confidently expect to see yellow fever stamped out in Habana<lb/>
in the course of three or four years after the construction of a good<lb/>
sewerage system, provided the same unremitting efforts are con-<lb/>
tinued under intelligent medical supervision and with the unrestricted<lb/>
help of the State.</p>
<p>The isolation and protection of patients is a most important<lb/>
measure, but hard of successful accomplishment on account of the<lb/>
difficulty of discovering and recognizing all cases. Many patients<lb/>
among the poorer classes are not seen by physicians, and the expe-<lb/>
rience of the last two or three years has led us to believe that many<lb/>
cases, especially among young children, are so mild that they pass<lb/>
unrecognized or are wrongly diagnosed. From these mild, ambu-<lb/>
latory, and consequently unprotected cases the fever is mostly spread.<lb/>
It is only when the profession becomes convinced that such cases<lb/>
really exist, and that, as foci of infection, they are as dangerous as<lb/>
severe cases, that perfect results will be obtained.</p>
<p>Our present knowledge concerning the agency of the mosquito in<lb/>
yellow fever explains much that was obscure before and furnishes<lb/>
useful indications to the sanitary physician. For instance, the part<lb/>
played by dirt and filth in the breeding and propagation of the fever<lb/>
was always problematical; now we know that they have nothing to<lb/>
do with it, except inasmuch as they may attract and feed mosquitoes.<lb/>
It is certain that in Habana, <hi>in 1900</hi>, no visible correlation could be<lb/>
seen between dirt and yellow fever; the <hi>district which first became<lb/>
strongly infected lies east and south of the Parque Central, and is<lb/>
one of the cleanest and best constructed, while the most insanitary</hi><lb/>
<pb n="223" id="S8220237"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
223<lb/>
wards became infected late in the season and only to a slight extent;<lb/>
the malodorous district reserved to houses of ill fame did hardly have<lb/>
a case. Yellow fever has not followed the poor and unclean, or the<lb/>
march of previous infections, but rather the movement of nonim-<lb/>
munes; wherever these located, there the infection searched and found<lb/>
them, regardless of the hygienic conditions of their premises, the most<lb/>
aristocratic apartments on the second and third floors being as liable<lb/>
to its invasion as any of the hovels crowded around a patio.</p>
<p>We also know that digging the ground, either for purposes of cul-<lb/>
tivation or construction or, for instance, the laying of sewers, is a<lb/>
perfectly harmless operation so far as yellow fever and malaria are<lb/>
concerned, provided no water is allowed to stagnate in any of the<lb/>
cuts and ditches. The value of this knowledge on the eve of under-<lb/>
taking our great work of sewerage can not be overestimated.</p>
<p>The positive agency of the mosquito in propagating yellow fever<lb/>
would naturally argue the noncontagiousness of the disease and the<lb/>
inertness of fomites; but in order that the demonstration might be<lb/>
complete, Maj. Reed and colleagues also conclusively proved by<lb/>
direct experiment that infected linen, bedding, and effects of all<lb/>
kinds are powerless to convey the disease. This discovery must bring<lb/>
about a revolution in our methods of disinfection and quarantine in<lb/>
yellow fever. Disinfection becomes completely useless, since there<lb/>
are no infectious germs to destroy. In a house where a case of yellow<lb/>
fever has been under treatment the problem is how to reach the<lb/>
mosquitoes which have become infected by biting the patient and<lb/>
are still lurking in the vicinity. It is probable that a certain propor-<lb/>
tion of mosquitoes, after feeding, fly out in search of water wherein<lb/>
to lay their eggs, in the immediate neighborhood, but enough remain<lb/>
in the patient's and contiguous rooms to require action. The best<lb/>
way to destroy them, so far as now known, is by fumigation. Sul-<lb/>
phur fumes are most efficacious, but otherwise so objectionable that<lb/>
preference should be given to formaldehyde, which, as we know, is<lb/>
much safer and more convenient. It kills mosquitoes in from 10 to<lb/>
15 minutes, so that rooms treated with it need not be closed more<lb/>
than three or four hours. The good effects of such fumigation seem<lb/>
to have been proved in preventing the recurrence of a second case in<lb/>
694 out of 885 infected houses in Habana, and by the absence of a<lb/>
single case in Santiago de Cuba in 1900, after the epidemic of 1899.</p>
<p>The duties of quarantine officers have also become singularly sim-<lb/>
plified. Since we may assume in practice that the infectious germs do<lb/>
not exist outside of man and the mosquito, the disinfection of trunks<lb/>
and baggage on account of yellow fever is no longer justifiable; all<lb/>
that is required will be the examination of nonimmunes within the<lb/>
five days immediately following their last exposure to infection, the<lb/>
danger of transmission being from their own persons and in no wise<lb/>
from their clothing or baggage. Ships, like houses, are liable to har-<lb/>
bor infected mosquitoes and will continue to require fumigation.</p>
<p>From what precedes it must be evident that the two chief factors<lb/>
in the propagation of yellow fever are mosquitoes and nonimmunes.<lb/>
Nonimmunes are almost entirely furnished by immigration. Were it<lb/>
possible to completely stop it, especially from Spain and the Canary<lb/>
Islands, for two or three years, it is almost certain that during that<lb/>
short period all germ-bearing mosquitoes could be destroyed, and<lb/>
the city thereafter kept as free from infection as Kingston in Jamaica<lb/>
<pb n="224" id="S8220238"/>
224<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
and San Juan in Porto Rico. Immigration, however, is too valuable<lb/>
to the interests of the island to be stopped, or even checked, for the<lb/>
sake of stamping <hi>out yellow fever, a disease without terror and of<lb/>
little consequence to Cubans</hi>. It is only possible, then, to take such<lb/>
measures as will protect as many nonimmunes as possible without<lb/>
interfering in any way with business interests. The plan lately<lb/>
adopted is practical and efficient: <hi>All nonimmune immigrants who<lb/>
do not come in answer to a call from Havana are taken to a detention<lb/>
station on the healthiest site around the bay, where they await in<lb/>
comfort and safety offers of employment</hi>. All employers of labor, or<lb/>
as many as it is possible to reach, have been notified of the existence<lb/>
of this station and invited to engage there all the hands they need.<lb/>
Earnest efforts are made to send as many as possible of these immi-<lb/>
grants to the rural districts where most wanted. In this way all are<lb/>
benefited: the immigrant who procures work without hardship or<lb/>
danger, the city of Havana, which is rid of dangerous nonimmune<lb/>
agglomerations, and employers who are enabled to get as many hands<lb/>
as they may require with the least trouble and expense.</p>
<p>The relation which Spanish immigration has borne to yellow fever<lb/>
is important and interesting. It has been most active in periods of<lb/>
peace and prosperity, becoming small or stopping altogether in years<lb/>
of political disturbance and insurrection, and statistics show that the<lb/>
spread of yellow fever among civilians is directly proportional to the<lb/>
number of immigrants.</p>
<p>Soldiers, on the contrary, were few in years of peace and contrib-<lb/>
uted little to the yellow fever mortality, but in troublous times they<lb/>
were greatly and rapidly increased, beginning to arrive as the civil<lb/>
immigration began to stop, so that their mortality curve rose as that<lb/>
of the civil population fell. Thus, when the last insurrection broke<lb/>
out, in 1895, immigration stopped; on the contrary, troops poured<lb/>
into Havana, and the result was a very high military mortality in<lb/>
1896, 1897, and 1898. <hi>When the American troops took possession of<lb/>
Havana on January 1, 1899, the whole population was practically<lb/>
immune, and, the Spanish troops having departed, cases of yellow<lb/>
fever ceased</hi>. The American troops formed the only susceptible or<lb/>
nonimmune element and <hi>disciplinary measures were successful, with<lb/>
one slight exception</hi>, in preventing their contagion. It therefore<lb/>
<hi>happened, naturally enough, that only few scattered cases were<lb/>
observed during the spring and summer of 1899. As soon as peace<lb/>
was assured the current of immigration was resumed, and in greater<lb/>
volume than ever</hi>. The result was immediately seen in the number of<lb/>
cases, which steadily increased from August to December, the number<lb/>
for December being larger than for the same month in any previous<lb/>
year; this is more striking because the death rate of yellow fever<lb/>
generally rises to its maximum in August and September and shows<lb/>
a marked decline from October to December.</p>
<p><hi>During the years 1899 and 1900, 40,384 immigrants arrived at<lb/>
Habana, namely 16,260 in 1899 and 24,124 in 1900, a great majority<lb/>
of them nonimmunes and at</hi> least 50 per cent remaining in the city<lb/>
of Habana. They still continue to come at about the same rate.<lb/>
With these figures of the largest immigration on record in the same<lb/>
space of time, what happened was to be expected and unavoidable,<lb/>
namely, an usually large number of cases of yellow fever in the<lb/>
summer and <hi>fall of 1900</hi> and <hi>corresponding high mortality, although</hi><lb/>
<pb n="225" id="S8220239"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
225<lb/>
<hi>the deaths (310)</hi> did not reach the annual average of the past decade.<lb/>
The effect of cold weather on the infection was, as usual, well marked;<lb/>
<hi>from 74 in October the number of deaths decreased to 57 in Novem-<lb/>
ber, 20 in December, and only 7 in January, 1901</hi>.</p>
<p>The subject of immunity against yellow fever is very interesting<lb/>
and deserves a few remarks. <hi>Immunity is not enjoyed by all<lb/>
Cubans, as popularly believed, but only by those residing in cities,<lb/>
not by those who have lived from infancy in the interior rural dis-<lb/>
tricts</hi>. In other words, <hi>immunity is only enjoyed by the residents<lb/>
of centers where yellow fever is endemic</hi>; it is not enough to have<lb/>
lived in a tropical climate; one must have lived in an infected locality.<lb/>
The inference therefore is strong that <hi>immunity is acquired only by<lb/>
an attack of the disease</hi>; there is no other infectious disease against<lb/>
which immunity is obtained in any other way, and there is no reason<lb/>
to believe that yellow fever is an exception to the rule. Under the<lb/>
former belief that it was acquired by the absorption of germs through<lb/>
the respiratory passages, it was possible to conceive the possibility<lb/>
of a very slow but constant infinitesimal absorption which might in<lb/>
time produce immunity without any apparent fever, but such a con-<lb/>
ception is no longer tenable if the germs are introduced directly into<lb/>
the blood by the mosquito. Those physicians who assume a priori<lb/>
that Cubans, whether they live in the city or country, can not have<lb/>
yellow fever, <hi>decline to recognize it when they find it in natives; they<lb/>
call it &ldquo;fiebre de borras&rdquo;</hi> and <hi>consider it a special form of malaria,<lb/>
which, strangely enough, only occurs in this island</hi>.</p>
<p>Since the great majority of Cubans are immune and immunity is<lb/>
only acquired by an attack of the disease, we are compelled to the<lb/>
conclusion that <hi>nearly all natives of Cuba must have yellow fever<lb/>
in their youth--probably in the first few years of their lives.</hi> At<lb/>
<hi>that age the disease appears to be mild and comparatively harmless</hi>,<lb/>
and we may fairly assume that the 5,000 children annually born in<lb/>
Habana have it in such form that it is generally unrecognized by<lb/>
physicians who diagnose it under the comprehensive headings of<lb/>
malaria, calentura or meningitis. In this connection it is interesting<lb/>
to observe that in epidemic years the proportion of deaths among<lb/>
children, not diagnosed yellow fever, is noticeably greater.</p>
<p>Here an interesting question suggests itself. If Cubans have yellow<lb/>
fever in infancy in such a mild form as not to endanger life and remain<lb/>
immune thereafter, why should they endeavor to eradicate the dis-<lb/>
ease in the island, so that their descendants will lose immunity and<lb/>
become liable to any epidemic that may break out hereafter? <hi>The<lb/>
answer is that foreign visitors and immigrants have natural rights<lb/>
that Cubans are bound to respect</hi>; that epidemics can be guarded<lb/>
against and avoided; and lastly, that although Cuban infants have<lb/>
the disease in an apparently mild form, it will probably be found,<lb/>
when the matter is investigated and the obscure diagnoses of many<lb/>
of the <hi>reported cases of death carefully analyzed</hi>, that a larger pro-<lb/>
portion of deaths among children than is generally believed is due<lb/>
to yellow fever or complications therefrom.</p>
<p>A few words in closing upon the result of treatment of yellow-fever<lb/>
cases at <hi>Las Animas hospital</hi>, an establishment intended for the<lb/>
reception and treatment of all contagious diseases, but chiefly yellow<lb/>
fever. <hi>During the year 1900 it was under the direction of</hi> Maj.<lb/>
<hi>W. C. Gorgas</hi>, chief sanitary officer, who devoted to it much of his<lb/>
79965&deg;--S. Doc. 822, 61-3----15<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
valuable time. The hospital is pleasantly situated in the outskirts<lb/>
of the city and as completely equipped with material and personnel<lb/>
as any hospital of its kind in the United States, <hi>American trained<lb/>
nurses being in attendance</hi>. An ambulance, carrying physician<lb/>
and nurse, is always in readiness to go when summoned, and the<lb/>
greatest care is taken to save patients all unnecessary fatigue or<lb/>
exertion in transit.</p>
<p>The patients sent to this hospital may be divided in two classes:<lb/>
<hi>First, Americans</hi> (including few other foreigners), the majority of<lb/>
them brought there at their own request early in the disease, but<lb/>
including also not a few homeless vagabonds and drunkards; second,<lb/>
<hi>Spaniards, mostly of the lowest classes</hi>, too poor and thriftless to<lb/>
belong to any of the quintas de salud.</p>
<p>It can easily be seen therefore that Las Animas receives most of<lb/>
the worst cases, generally after the disease has lasted several days,<lb/>
not infrequently the <hi>patients being unconscious and occasionally<lb/>
moribund</hi>, as shown by the fact that out of 58 deaths, 18 occurred<lb/>
within three days after admission. <hi>During the year 272</hi>, cases<lb/>
of yellow fever were admitted; 167 Americans, 74 Spaniards, and<lb/>
31 of other nationalities; 214 recovered and <hi>58 died</hi>, giving a<lb/>
<hi>general death rate of 21.33</hi>. Taking the three leading and best<lb/>
conducted private hospitals in Habana for comparison, namely,<lb/>
the Dependientes, Covadonga, and Benefica, we find that during the<lb/>
year their yellow fever death rates were 24.35, 27.51, and 24.35<lb/>
respectively, each higher than that of Las Animas, although their<lb/>
patients, being members of the centros or clubs to which the hospi-<lb/>
tals belong, are generally admitted early in the course of the disease<lb/>
and therefore in much more favorable conditions for successful<lb/>
treatment.</p>
<p><hi>At Las Animas the death rate of Spaniards was 36.48 and</hi> that of<lb/>
<hi>Americans 12.57</hi>, a most remarkable difference when we bear in<lb/>
mind that all patients there receive the same identical treatment<lb/>
in the same wards. This difference is partly due to the fact that<lb/>
<hi>Americans are in better physical condition</hi>, with greater power of<lb/>
resistance, but <hi>chiefly to the circumstance that they are admitted<lb/>
early</hi> and have the full benefit of the treatment. In this respect<lb/>
the status of Americans at Las Animas may be fairly compared to<lb/>
that of the Spaniards received at the above-mentioned hospitals,<lb/>
and yet their mortality is only one-half that of the latter. Such<lb/>
results furnish food for reflection. <hi>At Las Animas patients are<lb/>
treated almost entirely on the expectant plan; medicines are avoided<lb/>
until there is a clear indication for their use; absolute</hi> rest, very<lb/>
careful dieting, and the constant attention, day and night, of trained<lb/>
nurses have been the main features of treatment. The key to<lb/>
success in the treatment of yellow fever, I believe, is good nursing<lb/>
at the hands of specially trained women. Such nursing is expensive,<lb/>
and in Cuba has been practicable, so far, only in few other hospitals,<lb/>
but any method of treatment which saves lives is always found to be<lb/>
the cheapest.</p>

said report.</p>

<p>------</p>
<p>HALF-YEARLY REPORT OF THE HABANA YELLOW FEVER COMMISSION, JULY TO<lb/>
DECEMBER, 1901.</p>
<p>During the present term (<hi>July 1 to Dec. 31, 1901</hi>) the Yellow<lb/>
Fever Commission of Habana has examined and investigated 118<lb/>
cases, reported as follows: 94 yellow fever suspects (37 of which<lb/>
were confirmed as &ldquo;natural yellow fever&rdquo; and <hi>10 as &ldquo;experimental<lb/>
yellow fever&rdquo;</hi>); 7 suspected glanders (the diagnosis was confirmed<lb/>
in 4); 4 leprosy (confirmed in 3); 6 suspected smallpox (none of<lb/>
which were confirmed); 1 typhus fever (not confirmed); 1 relapsing<lb/>
fever (not confirmed); 5 reported as &ldquo;infectious fever&rdquo; (in 2 that<lb/>
diagnosis was maintained, inasmuch as these cases, while presenting<lb/>
clinical characters suggestive of an infection, could not be identified<lb/>
as malaria, typhoid, influenza, and Malta fever, and were therefore con-<lb/>
sidered as belonging to the group of &ldquo;Tropical unclassed fevers).</p>
<p>The 37 cases diagnosed as &ldquo;natural yellow fever&rdquo; have been dis-<lb/>
tributed in Table I, so as to differentiate those whose infection had<lb/>
originated in this city from others who were brought to Habana,<lb/>
already sick or infected, from other parts of this island, and also<lb/>
from those who came from foreign ports.</p>

</p>
<p>The <hi>wonderfully small number of yellow-fever</hi> cases and deaths in<lb/>
Habana during the epidemic season of the present year is <hi>an unprec-<lb/>
edented event</hi>, and since it can not be accounted for by any climatic<lb/>
variations nor by a lack of nonimmunes or of opportunities for a<lb/>
reproduction of the yellow-fever germ through the introduction of<lb/>
cases from outside, we are bound to admit that it must be attributed<lb/>
to the killing of contaminated mosquitoes wherever they were sup-<lb/>
posed to exist, and to the protection of nonimmunes in the vicinity<lb/>
of infected houses against the bites of those insects, as the sanitary<lb/>
department has been doing since February.</p>
<p>MANNER IN WHICH THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTED.</p>
<p><hi>The conclusive demonstration of the mosquito theory</hi>--by Dr. Reed,<lb/>
a year ago, and by Dr. Guit&eacute;ras this summer--has made it all the<lb/>
more necessary that the investigation of yellow-fever cases should be<lb/>
carried out with great care, so as to secure a reliable diagnosis, and to<lb/>
discover, if possible, the source whence the infection has been derived.</p>
<p>The method practiced by the commission has been as follows: The<lb/>
data contained in the original report are carefully gone over at the<lb/>
bedside of the patient and additional particulars inquired into in order<lb/>
to discover, if possible, the probable source of his infection. A clinical<lb/>
history of the case having been obtained from the physician in charge,<lb/>
it is minutely scrutinized, and the patient is then carefully examined<lb/>
by each of the members present. Particular attention is given to the<lb/>
examination of the urine for albumen, and it is believed that, while<lb/>
sources of error are avoided, so small a quantity as 10 centigrams of<lb/>
pure albumen per liter would not escape detection, as a recognizable<lb/>
trace, by the methods employed. The different organs are explored<lb/>
to detect or exclude any lesion to which some of the symptoms might<lb/>
be attributed, and every circumstance in antecedents of the patient<lb/>
is duly taken into account.</p>
<p>As a rule, the secretary of the commission, before the meeting of the<lb/>
board, has collected blood, sputa, pus, or other available material,<lb/>
according to the nature of the disease reported, and the said material<lb/>
has been examined for malarial parasite or bacteria, tried with the<lb/>
Widal test, etc. In the case of private patients, supplementary infor-<lb/>
mation has been obtained by the secretary from the attending<lb/>
physician, and, if necessary, the latter is requested to be present at the<lb/>
meeting of the board. Whenever any doubt remains in the minds<lb/>
of the members the decision is deferred and the patient reexamined<lb/>
as often as may be necessary. In fatal cases, provided the family or<lb/>
friends of the patient do not object, an autopsy is made, notes of the<lb/>
findings recorded, and hystological specimens preserved or cultures<lb/>
prepared for subsequent examination. The physician in charge is<lb/>
always expected to notify the commission or to report the case again<lb/>
<pb n="229" id="S8220243"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
229<lb/>
if the subsequent course of the attack should throw some doubt upon<lb/>
the decision of the board, in which event a reversal of the first diag-<lb/>
nosis would be voted if the majority of the members decided that<lb/>
there was occasion to do so.</p>
<p>USEFULNESS OF EXPERIMENTAL CASES FOR DIAGNOSIS.</p>
<p>In the diagnosis of mild cases of yellow fever it has been of great<lb/>
advantage to the commission to have the support of Dr. Reed's<lb/>
observation in <hi>one of his experimental cases, showing that an un-<lb/>
doubted attack of the disease may run its full course without present-<lb/>
ing any trace of albumen in the urine</hi>. Similar cases had been<lb/>
observed in private practice by members of the commission, and some<lb/>
of them have come before the board. The same may be said with<lb/>
reference to the importance of the typical fever curve as an element<lb/>
of diagnosis in nonalbuminuric cases.</p>
<p>SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE LIFE CYCLE AND HABITS OF THE STEGOMYIA<lb/>
NECESSARY IN ORDER TO FOLLOW TRACK OF AN EPIDEMIC.</p>
<p>The importance of ascertaining the source of the infection in every<lb/>
confirmed case of yellow fever is self-evident, since the sanitary<lb/>
department is thereby enabled to take prompt measures calculated<lb/>
to control the propagation of the disease. But that investigation,<lb/>
according to the now accepted etiology, can not be successfully<lb/>
accomplished without a knowledge of certain details concerning the<lb/>
life of the yellow-fever mosquito which are not easily found in the<lb/>
current literature on that subject, and it may not be considered out<lb/>
of place to recapitulate them in this report.</p>
<p><hi>The species of gnat</hi> which transmits yellow fever (<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia<lb/>
t&aelig;niata</hi>, Theob.-Culex mosquito, R. D.) is diurnal and crepuscular,<lb/>
for it may be met with at any hour between daybreak and nightfall,<lb/>
<hi>and takes its rest during the night. The males never bite nor suck<lb/>
blood; the females only do so after they have mated, and never lay<lb/>
their ova before having sucked blood. After a complete feed of<lb/>
blood the insect will not bite again until all the contents of its stomach<lb/>
have been digested or discharged; this process requires from 48 to 60</hi><lb/>
hours in summer, but may be delayed 2 or 3 days more in cool<lb/>
weather. The wings of the Stegomyia are so small that after a full<lb/>
meal it <hi>must be unable to fly to any height</hi> or even to any consider-<lb/>
able distance on a level. <hi>It shuns the sunshine</hi>, avoids flying across<lb/>
open waters, and <hi>keeps away from the wind</hi>. Its eggs are laid in a<lb/>
peculiar manner, some <hi>entirely out of the water, so that they are</hi> apt<lb/>
<hi>to remain unhatched during several weeks</hi> or months, and yet may<lb/>
develop a brood after that lapse of time when they happen to be cov-<lb/>
ered with water of a suitable temperature. <hi>It is probably by this<lb/>
means that the species is propagated during the cooler months of the<lb/>
Cuban climate</hi>. The Stegomyia breeds in any collection of water<lb/>
(a very small quantity is needed) in the yards, gardens, basements of<lb/>
houses, often in the lye water used by washerwomen in this country;<lb/>
but also inside of rooms when water has been allowed to stand sev-<lb/>
eral days in basins, jugs, or open bottles. A new brood may develop<lb/>
in 9 or 10 days if the larv&aelig; are abundantly provided with food (bread<lb/>
crumbs seem to agree very well with them), otherwise several weeks<lb/>
may elapse before the winged insect emerges from its pupa case.</p>
<pb n="230" id="S8220244"/>
<p>230<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>When the temperature falls to 20&deg;C. the insect is disinclined to<lb/>
fly, and below 15&deg; or 10&deg;C. it is benumbed and unable either to fly<lb/>
or to bite. It is killed by temperatures below freezing point or<lb/>
above 45&deg;C.; probably 30&deg; to 32&deg;C. is its optimum temperature.</p>
<p>The Stegomyia is very domestic in its habits and will not be likely<lb/>
to leave the premises on which it has taken up its quarters so long as<lb/>
it finds in it the <hi>necessary conditions for the completion of its life<lb/>
cycle (opportunities for satisfying its craving for human blood, water<lb/>
in which it may lay its ova, and an agreeable atmosphere suited to its<lb/>
tastes and of the required temperature)</hi> In the absence of any of<lb/>
those requisites it will migrate into the nearest place where they may<lb/>
be satisfied.</p>
<p>The Stegomyia becomes contaminated and acquires the faculty of<lb/>
transmitting the disease only after having bitten a yellow-fever<lb/>
patient within the first 5 or 6 days of his attack. <hi>During the first 2<lb/>
or 3 days of its contamination its bite may sometimes occasion an<lb/>
attenuated form of the disease</hi>, but after that period the insect <hi>loses<lb/>
for a while the faculty of inoculating the disease in any</hi> form, and it<lb/>
is only when 12 or more days have passed since its contamination<lb/>
that it acquires the power of producing a well-marked attack of yel-<lb/>
low fever, the virulence of its bite being then considerably greater in<lb/>
summer than in winter. The contaminated Stegomyia retains there-<lb/>
after, during its lifetime (which may last 70 days), the faculty of<lb/>
reproducing the disease every time that it chances to bite a non-<lb/>
immune.</p>
<p>The manner in which a nonimmune may become infected is appar-<lb/>
ently under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) By visiting a place where contaminated mosquitoes exist, at a<lb/>
time when those insects happen to be in a condition to bite and pre-<lb/>
pared to inoculate the disease.</item>
<item>(2) By the fact that a case of yellow fever has occurred in the<lb/>
neighborhood and mosquitoes contaminated from that patient have,<lb/>
for some reason, been induced to migrate into the nonimmune's<lb/>
dwelling.</item>
<item>(3) By the conveyance of contaminated mosquitoes in parcels,<lb/>
boxes, etc., or, possibly caught under a hat while biting the head of<lb/>
a visitor on his way to the nonimmune's house.</item>
<item>(4) During the hot summer days the Stegomyia is apt to fly out<lb/>
into the street, under porches, etc., suggesting the possibility of their<lb/>
biting a yellow fever patient on his way to the hospital if the carriage<lb/>
or the unprotected ambulance happens to be detained. In such a<lb/>
case, the insect, thus contaminated, would afterwards take refuge<lb/>
in one of the houses on the road to the hospital, and the nonimmunes<lb/>
in that house might, in due time, be inoculated by the infected<lb/>
mosquito.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>A PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE MOSQUITO THEORY.</p>
<p>As an illustration of the ways in which the yellow fever may be<lb/>
acquired, according to the preceding statements, and of the difficul-<lb/>
ties with which the sanitary department has had to contend this<lb/>
year in preventing the disease from spreading over the whole city,<lb/>
the following instance may be given as one in which the yellow fever<lb/>
commission was deeply interested.</p>
<pb n="231" id="S8220245"/>
<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
231</p>
<p>In one of our best hospitals in this city (Quinta de Dependientes)<lb/>
the upper story of a new building is reserved for yellow fever patients<lb/>
and suspects. That floor being divided into a right wing for con-<lb/>
firmed cases and the left wing for cases under observation, the landing<lb/>
of the stairs occupies the space between the two large screened doors,<lb/>
facing each other and opening into each of the two departments.<lb/>
Though well provided with wire netting, <hi>two defects</hi> were subse-<lb/>
quently noticed in the disposition of these wards: the <hi>height of</hi> the<lb/>
<hi>ceilings</hi>, which prevents mosquitoes from being seen when they<lb/>
occupy the upper part of the rooms, and the <hi>absence of any syphon<lb/>
or trap in the pipe leading off</hi> the water from a basin under the<lb/>
hydrant. Under these conditions, mosquito larv&aelig; might be bred<lb/>
outside the building where the defective pipe opens and the winged<lb/>
insect might find its way into the yellow fever ward, remaining there<lb/>
unseen after having bitten some of the patients. In fact, larv&aelig;<lb/>
were observed by us, on one occasion, in the water jug used in that<lb/>
ward.</p>
<p>On the 14th of August of this year, two nonimmunes were admitted<lb/>
into the observation ward with a fever which appeared suspicious<lb/>
but only turned out to have been a mild attack of influenza. Both<lb/>
were discharged on the 18th. One of them lived at Florida Street,<lb/>
No. 24, the other in a bakery in Aguila Street, No. 185, opposite<lb/>
the Tacon market. The man from Florida Street was attacked, on<lb/>
the 20th (two days after leaving the hospital) with fever and devel-<lb/>
oped a mild yellow fever. His house was duly fumigated and all<lb/>
the contaminated mosquitoes must have been killed, for no other<lb/>
case occurred in that neighborhood. The other man (No. 1), who<lb/>
lived at the bakery, was also attacked with yellow fever, but not<lb/>
until the 24th (six days after leaving the hospital), and two other<lb/>
men (Nos. 2 and 3), who worked in the same bakery and slept in<lb/>
rooms near his own, were also attacked, on the same day and the<lb/>
next respectively (Aug. 24 and 25). We must therefore infer that<lb/>
No. 1 had brought with him from the hospital some of the contami-<lb/>
nated mosquitoes which had inoculated him, and the incubation was<lb/>
shorter in the two other men than in his own case. The bakery was,<lb/>
of course, fumigated and most of the contaminated mosquitoes<lb/>
probably killed; but the disposition of the house and of its neighbor-<lb/>
hood was particularly unfavorable, and some of the numerous insects<lb/>
which had had a chance of biting one or other of the three simul-<lb/>
taneous cases must have escaped and flown across the narrow street<lb/>
into the porch of Tacon market, where fruit and flower venders lay<lb/>
out their goods on the floor under the porch and sit or stand the<lb/>
greater part of the morning waiting for purchasers. Two of those<lb/>
flower venders (Nos. 4 and 5) were attacked with yellow fever on the<lb/>
7th and 11th of September, respectively; the last of these developing<lb/>
into a fatal case, the first of the series. These two men lived in the<lb/>
Cerro, where they had their garden near Tulipan Park.</p>
<p>Their dwelling was fumigated effectively, for no other case of yellow<lb/>
fever occurred in the neighborhood. The owner of the bakery on<lb/>
Aguila Street lived in a house at the back of it, on Amistad Street,<lb/>
No. 136, and (No. 1), when questioned by the members of the com-<lb/>
mission at the hospital, had told them that after his attack of influ-<lb/>
enza he had first gone to the owner's house. That house was there-<lb/>
fore probably infected and duly fumigated; but from here also some<lb/>

of the contaminated insects must have escaped and taken refuge in<lb/>
a caf&eacute; close by, Amistad Street, No. 130, where the bartender (No. 6)<lb/>
was attacked with yellow fever on the 12th of September. This<lb/>
house was also fumigated, but the same contaminated insects which<lb/>
had bitten this case or others from the same source must have crossed<lb/>
Dragones Street and entered another house in the next block, Amistad<lb/>
No. 95, where a man servant (No. 7) was attacked with fatal yellow<lb/>
fever on the 14th of September. The next two cases occurred in two<lb/>
newly arrived immigrants (No. 8 and No. 9) who lived together in a<lb/>
room at Ricla, No. 32, a food distance from the infected quarter; but<lb/>
they informed us that they were in the habit of going almost every<lb/>
evening to a house in the block next to that of (No. 7) Amistad, No<lb/>
96, but on the other side of the street, to chat with an immune friend<lb/>
of theirs. These two men were attacked on the 21st and 22d of<lb/>
September. The killing of mosquitoes at their dwelling proved<lb/>
efficacious, for no other cases occurred near Ricla 32; but a few of<lb/>
the contaminated insects still remained in the block of (No. 7), for in<lb/>
a large tobacco factory occupying the south front of that block two<lb/>
of the workmen (No. 10 and No. 11) were attacked on the 28th of<lb/>
September. This time, however, the fumigation and killing of the<lb/>
mosquitoes within and around the tobacco factory must have killed<lb/>
the last of the infected insects, for no other case of yellow fever has<lb/>
been reported since in Habana.</p>
<p>DESIDERATUM.</p>
<p>The danger of new invasions which might insidiously acquire such<lb/>
proportions that they should prove difficult of control, comes prin-<lb/>
cipally from the want of a sure landmark by which to recognize even<lb/>
the mildest forms of the disease, a want which, it is feared, must<lb/>
subsist so long as the germ of the disease has not been definitely<lb/>
identified. With the certainty that the said germ is contained in<lb/>
the blood of the patient and <hi>also in the head of the contaminated<lb/>
stegomyia</hi>, it was thought that Drs. Reed and Carroll could not<lb/>
fail to discover that germ, knowing that they had apparently the<lb/>
best of materials to work upon and the assistance of experts well<lb/>
trained in the investigation of animal and vegetable germs. Their<lb/>
failure to do so has therefore caused general disappointment. The<lb/>
Yellow Fever Commission, howerer, considers it one of its duties not<lb/>
to let the matter drop, and to avail itself of Dr. Guiteras's permission<lb/>
and valuable cooperation for pursuing the search for the yellow-fever<lb/>
germ at the laboratory of his experimental station whenever a favor-<lb/>
able opportunity for doing so presents itself.</p>

<p>HABANA, <hi rend="italic">January 3, 1902</hi>.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Many years before the Yellow Fever Commission was organized,<lb/>
Dr. Carlos J. Finlay, of Habana, had formed the opinion that yellow<lb/>
fever was conveyed by the bites of mosquitoes and had fixed upon<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia calopus</hi> as the culpable agent. On June 30, 1881,<lb/>
he began a series of experiments to prove the transmission of the<lb/>
<pb n="233" id="S8220247"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
233<lb/>
disease by this insect, believing that he could in this way produce a<lb/>
mild type of fever which would convey immunity. He bred the<lb/>
mosquitoes in captivity and developed a technique for transporting<lb/>
them and placing them upon the patients, and between the date<lb/>
above mentioned and the arrival of the Yellow Fever Commission in<lb/>
Cuba he had <hi>made 103 experiments of which he regarded a consid-</hi><lb/>
erable number as successful.</p>
<p>In the light of our present exact knowledge of the length of incu-<lb/>
bation of yellow fever in man and the considerable period of incuba-<lb/>
tion in the mosquito between the time of biting and when she be-<lb/>
comes able to transmit the infection, and also the very brief period<lb/>
(three days) at the begining of the disease during which alone the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">patient is able to infect the mosquito, <hi>it must be recognized that</hi><lb/>
probably none of Dr. Finlay's experiments were successful, but none<lb/>
the less must credit be given for what Col. Gorgas has termed the<lb/>
&ldquo;scientific clairvoyance&rdquo; with which he had conceived his theory<lb/>
and the enthusiasm with which he maintained it.</hi></p>
<p><hi>When Maj. Reed went into Habana to consult</hi> him, before begin-<lb/>
ning the work of the board, he gave him eggs of <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia calopus</hi><lb/>
which he specifically stated were those of the mosquito which con-<lb/>
veyed the disease, and the <hi>first experiments of the board were made<lb/>
with mosquitoes grown from these</hi> eggs. As Dr. Finlay was the<lb/>
originator of this theory, and was of great assistance to the com-<lb/>
mission, the above report of his, which is of scientific as well as his-<lb/>
torical value, is published in this place, <hi>although it is recognized that<lb/>
some of the views expressed by him are at variance with the findings<lb/>
of the commission</hi>.</p>

<head>REPORT OF MAJ. W. C. GORGAS, MEDICAL CORPS, UNITED<lb/>
STATES ARMY.</head>
<p>HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF CUBA,<lb/>
OFFICE OF CHIEF SANITARY OFFICER OF HABANA,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">July 12, <hi>1902</hi></hi>.</p>
<p>GENERAL: I herewith forward the report of the sanitary depart-<lb/>
ment, bringing the account of the work up to May 20 of the present<lb/>
year.</p>
<p>This being the final report of the sanitary department of the city<lb/>
of Habana under the military government, it might be <hi>useful to<lb/>
review, in a general way, the work of the department since its incep-<lb/>
tion in 1899</hi>.</p>
<p>The great object of sanitation for Cuba, and particularly for<lb/>
Habana, as far as the United States was concerned, was the erad-<lb/>
ication of yellow fever. For over 200 years this disease had, at<lb/>
short intervals, devastated the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the<lb/>
United States, causing great loss of life, and still greater financial<lb/>
loss, due to the entire cessation of commerce which occurred during<lb/>
the epidemic. It is estimated that the <hi>money loss caused directly</hi><lb/>
by the epidemic of 1878, which affected particularly the lower<lb/>
Mississippi Valley, <hi>amounted to $100,000,000, and in years</hi> when<lb/>
there was no epidemic quarantines had to be kept up against the<lb/>
infected regions around the Gulf of Mexico, which stopped almost<lb/>
all travel and greatly interfered with commerce. The United<lb/>
States had come to look upon Habana as the particular point from<lb/>
which infection was spread. Yellow fever has been continuously<lb/>
present in this city <hi>since 1762</hi>. Every month in every year during<lb/>
that time there have been some cases. In all other localities of<lb/>
North America where yellow fever occurred, it occurred epidemically;<lb/>
that is, the locality was free from the disease for a longer or shorter<lb/>
time. In places above the frost line winter always puts an end to<lb/>
the disease, and in localities in the Tropics it always terminates after<lb/>
a greater or lesser period of years from the exhaustion of the nonim-<lb/>
mune material. It was therefore hoped by the military authorities<lb/>
that if yellow fever could be controlled in Habana the United States<lb/>
would be free from danger of epidemic invasion.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent objects, then, that the military govern-<lb/>
ment had before it during its stay in Cuba was the control of yellow<lb/>
fever, and for this purpose we paid great attention to the improve-<lb/>
ment of the hygienic conditions all over the island. But Habana<lb/>
being the only endemic focus in the island, and, for that matter,<lb/>
anywhere else in North America, the energies of the military govern-<lb/>
ment were concentrated at this point.</p>
<p>None who knew anything of yellow fever had any clear idea how<lb/>
its eradication was to be accomplished, but there was a general<lb/>
belief and hope that by improving the sanitary conditions the disease<lb/>
234<lb/>
<pb n="235" id="S8220249"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
235<lb/>
here could be greatly decreased, and possibly in the course of a<lb/>
number of years gradually gotten rid of, as has been the case in the<lb/>
cities of the United States. But no one, I think, who knew anything<lb/>
of yellow fever practically would have ventured to predict that<lb/>
much could have been done in this line in the course of three years.</p>
<p><hi>In Habana the government went</hi> vigorously to work, rapidly<lb/>
organizing street cleaning, disposal of garbage, and the cleaning of<lb/>
premises. In a very few months the streets were as clean as those<lb/>
of any modern city and the garbage regularly disposed of. But the<lb/>
internal sanitation of houses and the organization of the sanitary<lb/>
department for the reporting and control of contagious and infectious<lb/>
diseases, and similar matters, took a longer time.</p>
<p><hi>In the early part of 1899</hi>, the first year of the military occupation,<lb/>
very little yellow fever occurred. The preceding five years had<lb/>
been years of war, and for the last few months the American blockade<lb/>
had practically put an end to immigration into Habana, and the<lb/>
nonimmune population was pretty well exhausted, so that there<lb/>
were few left capable of having this disease. In January, there was<lb/>
one death; in February, none; in March, one; in April, two; in<lb/>
May, none; in June, one, and in July, two. That is, in the first<lb/>
seven months of 1899 there were only seven deaths from yellow<lb/>
fever. <hi>The military governor of the city, Gen. Ludlow, felt sure that<lb/>
the measures which were being taken had pretty well eradicated</hi> it.</p>
<p>But about the <hi>1st of August, Spanish</hi> immigration began to pour<lb/>
into Habana, and between August and December some 12,000<lb/>
immigrants arrived in the city, about 60 per cent of whom settled in<lb/>
Habana. This at once started up yellow fever, and <hi>by December of<lb/>
1899 we were having a severe winter epidemic</hi>. This continued<lb/>
right along through <hi>1900, during which year we had a very sharp</hi><lb/>
epidemic, having in all some <hi>1,400 cases</hi>.</p>
<p>The general sanitary conditions had improved, as indicated by<lb/>
the falling death rate, in a very satisfactory manner; but our work<lb/>
was evidently having no effect upon yellow fever. This disease was<lb/>
under control everywhere else in the island, but the principal means<lb/>
of reducing it, the deportation of the nonimmune population, so<lb/>
successful everywhere else, was not practicable in Habana.</p>
<p><hi>By the beginning of 1901 the sanitary department was pretty<lb/>
well satisfied that ordinary sanitary measures were having no imme-<lb/>
diate effect upon yellow fever</hi>. The city during the year 1900 was<lb/>
as clean and in as good sanitary condition as it was possible for labor<lb/>
to make it, and affairs could not be gotten into better condition until<lb/>
after the completion of a sewer system.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1900 a commission of Army medical officers<lb/>
headed by Maj. Walter Reed, United States Army, had been sent to<lb/>
Cuba for the investigation and study of yellow fever. Due to the<lb/>
financial assistance given by the military governor to this commis-<lb/>
sion, they were enabled to experiment on the human subject. They<lb/>
took up the theory advanced by Dr. Carlos Finlay of Habana, in<lb/>
the <hi>year 1880</hi>, that the <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi> mosquito was the sole means of<lb/>
the transmission of yellow fever. Dr. Finlay had maintained this<lb/>
theory for <hi>some 20 years</hi>, and had done considerable experimental<lb/>
work in this direction.</p>
<p>The commission, through elaborate and careful experimentation,<lb/>
proved this to be correct, and in February, 1901, Dr. Reed read a<lb/>
<pb n="236" id="S8220250"/>
236<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
paper before the International Sanitary Congress, in Habana, giving<lb/>
the results of their work. <hi>This idea was so new and so entirely<lb/>
contrary to all former theories on the subject, and, apparently</hi>, to<lb/>
all former experience, that the <hi>paper was received with scant belief</hi>.<lb/>
I myself had seen the work, and was convinced that the mosquito<lb/>
could convey yellow fever, but I was hardly prepared to believe that it<lb/>
was the only way, or even the ordinary way, of conveying the disease.</p>
<p>But all ordinary sanitary measures for the preceding two years<lb/>
had been flat failures. Yellow fever at the beginning of 1901 was<lb/>
about as bad as it had ever been in Habana at that time of the year.<lb/>
The city was infected in every part, and there was present probably<lb/>
the largest nonimmune population that had ever before been in<lb/>
Habana.</p>
<p><hi>I had very little hope of accomplishing much</hi>; it seemed to me that<lb/>
even if the mosquito did convey yellow fever, he could not be gotten<lb/>
rid of, and, apparently, from all past experience, the mosquito was<lb/>
not the only way, or even the principal way, of conveying the disease;<lb/>
but, as he evidently could convey the disease, it was our duty to<lb/>
take precautions in this direction.</p>
<p>The military governor readily granted the necessary appropriation<lb/>
and authorized the employment of as large a force as needful for mos-<lb/>
quito work. <hi>Work was commenced on this line February 4, 1901</hi>,<lb/>
and pushed in every direction. The results soon began to be appar-<lb/>
ent. In January there were seven deaths from yellow fever; in Feb-<lb/>
ruary, the first month of mosquito work, five deaths; in March, one<lb/>
death; none in April, May, or June; one in July; two in August; and<lb/>
two in September, <hi>and for the nine months following September,<lb/>
1901, not a single case nor a death has occurred from this disease.<lb/>
This result convinced the sanitary department that the mosquito not<lb/>
only could convey yellow fever, but that it was the ordinary way,<lb/>
and the only way, at least in Habana, for the conditions in Habana</hi><lb/>
during 1901 were as favorable for a yellow fever epidemic as they had<lb/>
ever been. The city had the largest nonimmune population, proba-<lb/>
bly, that it had ever contained. Infection was scattered in every<lb/>
part of the city; not only so, but the small towns surrounding the<lb/>
city were thoroughly infected, and were constantly sending cases<lb/>
into the city. <hi>We continued the same sanitary measures that had<lb/>
been taken during the preceding year, and which had not had the<lb/>
slightest effect upon the march of yellow fever; but, in addition, we</hi><lb/>
we took measures looking to the Stegomyia mosquito as the means<lb/>
of conveying the disease. Immediately after the adoption of these<lb/>
measures, yellow fever began to decrease, and by September had<lb/>
been entirely eradicated from the city.</p>
<p>The demonstration is the more effective in Habana from the fact<lb/>
that in all other cities of North America yellow fever lasts for a<lb/>
greater or lesser number of <hi>years</hi>, and then disappears from natural<lb/>
causes, to reappear again when conditions are favorable. In Habana<lb/>
the conditions have been different. For 150 years yellow fever has<lb/>
been constantly present in the city. From September, 1901, to July,<lb/>
1902, not a single case nor a death has occurred. In the 150 years<lb/>
referred to, not any year, probably, can be picked out in which dur-<lb/>
ing the same period there were less than 100 deaths.</p>
<p>This, it seems to me, is a practical demonstration, given in the only<lb/>
endemic focus for yellow fever in North America, and in a year when<lb/>
<pb n="237" id="S8220251"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
237<lb/>
the conditions were most favorable for the development of the disease,<lb/>
of the fact that the Stegomyia mosquito is the only method of trans-<lb/>
mitting it--a fact proved by the Army commission.</p>
<p>Under Army administration the death rate in Habana has de-<lb/>
creased in a marked degree. In 1898, the number of deaths was<lb/>
21,252, giving a rate of 91.03; in 1899, the first year of our occupa-<lb/>
tion, we had 8,153 deaths, giving a rate of 33.67; in 1900, we had<lb/>
6,102 deaths, giving a rate of 24.40; in 1901, we had 5,720 deaths,<lb/>
giving a rate of 22.11; for the first four months of 1902 there occurred<lb/>
1,896 deaths, which if kept up for the year would give 5,688 deaths,<lb/>
a rate of 20.68 for the year.</p>
<p>Thus it can be seen that under the military government, in a little<lb/>
over three years the death rate was reduced from 91.03 to 20.68.<lb/>
The latter rate would be a favorable one for the better class of cities<lb/>
in Europe or the United States. And this has come about without<lb/>
making any permanent sanitary installations, such as sewage. The<lb/>
city was kept as clean as it was possible for labor to make it, with<lb/>
regard to the streets, disposal of garbage, and the interior of the<lb/>
houses. But every house in Habana, somewhere under the house,<lb/>
still has a cesspool, the flow from which sinks into the surrounding<lb/>
ground, and as this has been going on for 400 years, the ground itself<lb/>
is as thoroughly saturated with organic matter as is possible.</p>
<p>The authorities had hardly hoped for such marked improvement<lb/>
until this system of cesspools has been done away with by a good<lb/>
system of sewage. But apparently the condition referred to has no<lb/>
very great effect upon the general health of the city; the improve-<lb/>
ment has come about from a careful street cleaning, disposal of garb-<lb/>
age, internal sanitation of houses, and rigid control of infectious and<lb/>
contagious diseases.</p>
<p>Our work down here has been a useful lesson in municipal sani-<lb/>
tation. The same thing could be accomplished by any community<lb/>
anywhere else, if they were willing to spend money and labor upon<lb/>
it. No elaborate machinery of any kind is necessary; merely men<lb/>
and brooms.</p>
<p>The primary object of the war with Spain was the liberation of<lb/>
Cuba from Spanish domination, but, at the same time, the United<lb/>
States had hoped to accomplish a good deal in improving the sani-<lb/>
tary condition of the island. In this she has succeeded beyond her<lb/>
utmost expectations, and the results in Cuba have been a new de-<lb/>
parture in military conquest. The only other people who bear<lb/>
comparison with us in attempting to improve the sanitary condi-<lb/>
tions of a tropical country are the English, and neither in Jamaica nor<lb/>
in India have they been very successful in this respect.</p>
<p>Much to our surprise, we find that not only can a native city like<lb/>
Habana be made as healthy as the better class of cities in the United<lb/>
States, but that our own troops, with proper care, thrive just as<lb/>
well in the Tropics as they do in the Temperate Zone. With the<lb/>
troops, the health conditions have steadily improved, until at the<lb/>
evacuation of Cuba the health rate was better among them than the<lb/>
average of troops in the United States.</p>
<p>Our first year in Cuba, 1898, with an average of 8,345 men, we<lb/>
had a death rate from disease of 67.94 per thousand. The health<lb/>
conditions steadily improved during the four years of our occupation,<lb/>
and for the last three months of 1902, with an average strength of<lb/>
<pb n="238" id="S8220252"/>
238<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
5,000 men, we had a death rate from disease of 1.76 per thousand.<lb/>
This means that the first year of our life in the Tropics we lost 67<lb/>
men out of every thousand, from disease; the last year of our stay,<lb/>
we had profited by our experience to such an extent that we lost<lb/>
only 7 men per thousand.</p>
<p>From our experience in Cuba, several useful lessons can be de-<lb/>
duced. We find that the native in the Tropics, with the same sani-<lb/>
tary precautions that are taken in the Temperate Zones, can be just<lb/>
as healthy and have just as small a death rate as the inhabitants of<lb/>
the Temperate Zone; that to bring this about, no elaborate machinery<lb/>
 of any kind is needed; that it can be attained by any community,<lb/>
no matter how poor, if they are willing to spend sufficient labor in<lb/>
cleaning, and observing well-known rules with regard to disease;<lb/>
that the North American Anglo-Saxon can lead just as healthy a<lb/>
life and live just as long in the Tropics as in the United States.</p>
<p>But by far the most important sanitary lesson is with regard to<lb/>
yellow fever--that this disease is only conveyed by the stegomyia<lb/>
mosquito; that the disease can readily be eradicated, even when it<lb/>
has gotten a firm hold, and easily kept from establishing itself by<lb/>
taking measures looking to the mosquito as its cause.</p>
<p><hi>I look forward in the future to a time when yellow fever will have<lb/>
entirely disappeared as a disease to which mankind is subject, for I</hi><lb/>
believe that <hi>when the yellow fever parasite has once become extinct<lb/>
it can no more return than the dodo or any other species</hi> of animal<lb/>
that has disappeared from the earth.</p>

<p>----------</p>
<p>As this article is not intended for the reading of people who have<lb/>
given any particular attention to the facts at present known of the<lb/>
way in which the mosquito carries disease from one person to another,<lb/>
I think it best to briefly call attention to the leading points in our<lb/>
present knowledge of this subject.</p>
<p>Malaria and yellow fever are the two great diseases with which the<lb/>
mosquito is concerned. They are by far the most important diseases<lb/>
in the tropical countries of the Western Hemisphere, and play a great<lb/>
part in the sickness of the southern part of the United States. Up to<lb/>
25 years ago it was universally believed that malaria was caused by a<lb/>
gas, or miasm, arising from the decomposition of dead vegetable mat-<lb/>
ter in hot countries, but about that time <hi>a French army surgeon</hi> in<lb/>
<hi>Algeria, Laveran by name</hi>, noticed that if he looked sufficiently care-<lb/>
fully with his microscope, in the blood of persons suffering from<lb/>
malaria, he could almost always find a very small animal parasite.<lb/>
This little, living being got into the blood in some way, Laveran did<lb/>
not know how, fed upon the red blood corpuscles, and was apparently<lb/>
the cause of the disease which we call malaria. Laveran's discovery<lb/>
was a great advance in our knowledge of the disease, and it was<lb/>
gradually accepted by all the medical world.</p>
<p>A careful search was made for the parasite by many investigators,<lb/>
but it could only be found in the blood of human beings suffering from<lb/>
malaria. Where else it was bred and how it got into the blood of<lb/>
man no one could find out. About this time it was discovered by an<lb/>
<hi>English army surgeon, Dr. Manson</hi>, that a small worm--the <hi rend="italic">Filaria<lb/>
sanguinis hominis</hi>--was introduced into the body by the bite of a mos-<lb/>
quito. (This worm causes the disease among human beings known as<lb/>
<hi>filariasis</hi>, and to it are due the enormous and unsightly swellings of<lb/>
the legs and other parts of the body seen by our people in Cuba and<lb/>
the Philippines. It is, however, a disease very rarely found in the<lb/>
United States, and not of much importance to us. I only mention it<lb/>
here in connection with my story of the mosquito.)</p>
<p>About 15 years after the discovery of Laveran that malaria was<lb/>
due to an insect in the blood, and of Manson, that a certain worm<lb/>
which caused disease was introduced into the human blood by the bite<lb/>
of a mosquito, another great <hi>English army surgeon, Ronald Ross</hi>,</p>

<p>240<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.</p>
<p>discovered <hi>that the malarial parasite was found in a certain species</hi> of<lb/>
<hi>mosquito--the anopheles</hi>--after the insect had bitten a human being<lb/>
suffering from malaria. With his microscope he followed the life<lb/>
history of this parasite, from the stomach of the mosquito, through<lb/>
the walls of the stomach into the mosquito's body, and finally into its<lb/>
salivary glands. In the saliva of the mosquito, the little organism<lb/>
was found in large numbers, and when biting man, for the purpose of<lb/>
getting blood, the mosquito injects her fatal saliva, just as does the<lb/>
rattlesnake when he bites. This discovery of Dr. Ross was demon-<lb/>
strated in the most positive manner.</p>
<p>An Italian living near Rome, in Italy (malaria is very bad in the<lb/>
neighborhood of Rome), while suffering from a malarial attack was<lb/>
bitten by an anopheles mosquito. This mosquito was then taken to<lb/>
London, England, where they have no malaria, and a healthy young<lb/>
man, who had never had malaria, was bitten by her. In a few days the<lb/>
young man had a well-marked attack of malaria, with the usual symp-<lb/>
toms, and the malarial parasite was seen by the microscope circulating<lb/>
in the blood of the patient and feeding upon the red blood corpuscles<lb/>
of his blood. <hi>And, again, men were taken, put into houses, screened<lb/>
so that mosquitoes could not get in, and spent weeks in this unhealthy<lb/>
part of Italy without getting</hi> sick. Yet this particular part of Italy<lb/>
is considered so unhealthy that during the summer season neither<lb/>
native nor foreigner, who can avoid it, spends a night there.</p>
<p><hi>A night spent in the Campania used</hi> to be thought a certain way to<lb/>
contract malaria, the idea being that the foul air from the marshes<lb/>
caused the disease. Yet it is now seen that entirely unacclimated men<lb/>
can breathe this air with safety, provided only that they live in screened<lb/>
houses and are not bitten by mosquitoes. These and similar facts con-<lb/>
vinced the scientific world that the malarial organism gets into the<lb/>
blood of the human being through the bite of the anopheles mosquito,<lb/>
and in no other way.</p>
<p>Before the year 1900 it was universally believed that yellow fever<lb/>
was carried from person to person and spread generally by a germ<lb/>
which up to that time had not been discovered. The germ was sup-<lb/>
posed to travel from person to person by contact with those sick of the<lb/>
disease, or by means of clothing or other articles which had been near<lb/>
the sick, and its development was believed to be greatly favored by all<lb/>
conditions which increased filth. There were a good many facts in the<lb/>
spread of the disease which were difficult to account for under this sup-<lb/>
position, but nevertheless it was the best explanation possible, and,<lb/>
as I said, was almost universally accepted, both by physicians and<lb/>
people generally.</p>
<p>During the year 1900 the Army of the United States had entire<lb/>
control of Habana, at that time the great center of yellow fever for<lb/>
the world. An excellent opportunity for investigating the disease<lb/>
therefore existed. The Surgeon General of the Army sent to Habana<lb/>
a board of Army medical officers for the purpose of investigating<lb/>
yellow fever. This board was made up of the following Army doctors:<lb/>
Dr. Reed, the president, and Drs. Carroll, Agramonte, and Lazear.<lb/>
After much investigation they determined to study the relation of the<lb/>
mosquito to yellow fever. Their attention was called to this matter<lb/>
by the part that the mosquito had already been proved to play in<lb/>
malaria and filariasis, as mentioned above, and also by certain facts<lb/>
known in the history of yellow fever epidemics. Dr. Finlay, a prom-<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>

inent physician of Habana, reasoning from certain peculiarities of<lb/>
yellow fever and from experiments which he made, had maintained<lb/>
for many years that a certain kind of mosquito in Habana, the stego-<lb/>
myia, was the cause of yellow fever, <hi>but he had not been able to<lb/>
prove it</hi>.</p>
<p>DIRECTIONS WITH REGARD TO DESTROYING MOSQUITOES.</p>
<p>The Army board of which Dr. Reed was president recognized that<lb/>
in Cuba, where they did their work, it would have to be entirely<lb/>
evident that the men experimented upon could not get yellow fever<lb/>
accidentally in Habana, or anywhere else, but only, if at all, in the<lb/>
course of the experiment. <hi>They therefore took a piece of unoccupied<lb/>
ground about 6 miles from Habana and built there a camp of material<lb/>
which could not have been infected with yellow fever</hi>. They then<lb/>
got men who had never suffered from yellow fever and placed them in<lb/>
these tents. It was known that if a man exposed to yellow fever was<lb/>
going to have it the disease would develop in less than six days, and<lb/>
if he passed through six days safe and sound he was known to have<lb/>
escaped that particular exposure.</p>
<p>The board therefore argued that if they kept their men in this camp<lb/>
for a period of two weeks they would be safe from any exposure<lb/>
which might have occurred before their coming to the camp. They<lb/>
also had to provide means which would insure their men not leaving<lb/>
the camp, contracting the disease outside, and thus bringing infection<lb/>
into the camp. This was done by a military guard, who allowed no<lb/>
one to go out or come in without Dr. Reed's permission. Things were<lb/>
now so arranged that if a mosquito was allowed to bite a man, and<lb/>
yellow fever developed, the board could be certain that the yellow<lb/>
fever was due to the bite of the mosquito alone. They did a great<lb/>
deal of experimenting here before they worked out all the details of<lb/>
the way in which the mosquito actually conveys yellow fever. They<lb/>
finally found out that if a female mosquito of one particular species,<lb/>
the stegomyia, was applied to a yellow-fever patient in the first 3<lb/>
days of his sickness, and then kept from 10 to 20 days and allowed<lb/>
to bite a human being who had never had yellow fever, he would<lb/>
very generally develop the disease within 6 days after the bite.</p>
<p>They also found out that this same man, before he had been bitten<lb/>
by the yellow-fever mosquito, could sleep in the bed in which a patient<lb/>
had died of yellow fever, could be covered with a black vomit from a<lb/>
yellow-fever patient, or be exposed to the emanations from yellow<lb/>
fever in any other way, and as long as he was kept safe from the bite<lb/>
of the mosquito he would not have yellow fever; but this same man,<lb/>
after all this exposure, if afterwards bitten by an infected yellow-fever<lb/>
mosquito, would very certainly catch the disease. I think it would be<lb/>
interesting to give some of the details of the work by which this great<lb/>
discovery was demonstrated.</p>
<p><hi>They had a little frame building built in this camp furnished</hi> with<lb/>
jars and the necessary simple material for breeding mosquitoes. The<lb/>
building was carefully screened and guarded, so that mosquitoes could<lb/>
not get in nor out. Eggs of this particular species of mosquito were<lb/>
obtained and hatched in one of the jars. A female mosquito was<lb/>
taken from the brood thus hatched. The male mosquito will not bite,<lb/>
and can readily be distinguished from the female with a magnifying<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
glass by the fact that the male has very heavy feathery feelers (anten-<lb/>
n&aelig;) growing from his head. The female mosquito selected was put<lb/>
into a small glass tube, stoppered with a little cotton, so that she could<lb/>
get air freely but not escape, taken to Habana, placed on the hand of a<lb/>
patient in the first three days of an attack of yellow fever, and allowed<lb/>
to fill herself with blood. She was then brought back to her former<lb/>
home, placed in a large glass jar, and allowed to digest the blood she<lb/>
had obtained. <hi>The jar, covered with a piece of mosquito netting, had<lb/>
in it a small saucer with a little water, and a lump of white sugar was<lb/>
also provided. Under these conditions the mosquito was furnished<lb/>
with all the necessities of life</hi>.</p>
<p>So confident were the men in charge of the mosquitoes that I have<lb/>
known them to put their hands in the jars and let the mosquitoes feed<lb/>
upon them, up to the fifth or sixth day after the mosquito had bitten<lb/>
a yellow-fever patient. The mosquito, you recollect, can not convey<lb/>
the disease till from 12 to 20 days have passed from the time of her<lb/>
biting the yellow-fever case from which she becomes infected.</p>
<p><hi>On the other hand, I once saw a party of 12 or 15 doctors in the<lb/>
mosquito room one day, when the mosquito-bar covering of the jar<lb/>
accidentally came off and the insects escaped into the room. These<lb/>
doctors had come from other countries to investigate the subject, and<lb/>
were not then convinced that the mosquito carried yellow fever</hi>.<lb/>
Still, they did not care to put the matter to a practical test in their<lb/>
own persons, <hi>and got out of the room so rapidly that the wire-screen<lb/>
door was broken down during their exit. It</hi> happened that the mos-<lb/>
quitoes in this jar had never bitten a yellow-fever patient and were not<lb/>
infected.</p>
<p>After the mosquito had been left in this condition for from 10 to 20<lb/>
days, it was known that her saliva was capable of transmitting the<lb/>
disease. When she was wanted for the purpose of giving somebody<lb/>
yellow fever, a <hi>man would take a glass tube, slip his hand under the<lb/>
mosquito netting, put the mouth of the tube over the mosquito</hi>, and<lb/>
<hi>then fill the mouth of the tube with a cotton stopper</hi>, as above<lb/>
described. She would then be taken to the man to whom it was<lb/>
desired to give yellow fever and who had bravely volunteered for the<lb/>
purpose, <hi>the cotton stopper taken out, the tube turned upside down<lb/>
with its mouth resting on the skin, and the mosquito allowed</hi> to settle.<lb/>
She would then introduce her biting apparatus and slowly fill herself<lb/>
with blood. <hi>But before she fills with blood she injects her saliva into<lb/>
the wound, just as does the snake in biting. It is this injection of the<lb/>
saliva that causes the swelling and the burning sensation that</hi> is felt<lb/>
at the point where the mosquito bites and which lasts some time after<lb/>
she has finished. The injection of the irritating saliva probably has<lb/>
the effect of making it easier for the mosquito to get blood.</p>
<p>Now, it will be remembered that this man who was bitten had been<lb/>
kept in the camp for two weeks before he was bitten, and isolated in<lb/>
such a way that he could not possibly have contracted yellow fever.<lb/>
<hi>There were 30 or 40 men in the same camp under exactly the same<lb/>
conditions</hi>. Three or four days after he was bitten by the mosquito<lb/>
he developed a well-marked case of yellow fever, although everybody<lb/>
else in the camp remained well. Dr. Reed and his fellow workers<lb/>
therefore very naturally believed that that particular mosquito gave<lb/>
the man yellow fever. They repeated this test 12 or 15 different times<lb/>
with the same result. Nobody else in the camp had yellow fever.<lb/>
<pb n="243" id="S8220257"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
243<lb/>
Always within six days after the bite of the mosquito known to be<lb/>
infected the man experimented upon had yellow fever.</p>
<p>To show how a house could become infected with yellow fever the<lb/>
board conducted the following experiment: They built a large room<lb/>
and screened it so that mosquitoes could not get in or out. (When-<lb/>
ever I use the word &ldquo;screen&rdquo; here I mean the ordinary wire netting or<lb/>
mosquito bar.) The purpose is of course to leave a perfectly free cir-<lb/>
culation of air, but to have the meshes of the wire or mosquito bar<lb/>
netting so small that a mosquito can not get through. They then<lb/>
divided this room into two parts by a wire netting extending from top<lb/>
to bottom, so that a mosquito could not pass from one side to the other,<lb/>
but at the same time leaving the circulation of air entirely free, the<lb/>
desire being to show that if it were any miasm, or emanation, or germ<lb/>
floating in the air which caused yellow fever it could freely pass from<lb/>
one side to the other of this netting, and that both rooms, as far as<lb/>
these emanations were concerned, were in the same condition.</p>
<p>Now, to show that the building was uninfected, four men were put<lb/>
in it who had never had yellow fever, two sleeping on each side of the<lb/>
wire netting. They were left there for two weeks and remained per-<lb/>
fectly well. Reed then said, &ldquo;I am now going to infect the room on<lb/>
one side of this wire netting with yellow fever and not infect the other<lb/>
side.&rdquo; He took the two men out of one side and liberated a half<lb/>
dozen infected female Stegomyia mosquitoes on this side. The two<lb/>
men still slept and lived on the uninfected side. He then put a<lb/>
volunteer on the side with the mosquitoes and left him there for half<lb/>
an hour, took him out, and within six days this man developed yellow<lb/>
fever, the two men on the other side of the room remaining well.</p>
<p>He therefore argued that, as the two men who had been for so long<lb/>
a time on one side of the wire netting and remained well were breath-<lb/>
ing the same emanations, and the only difference was that there were<lb/>
mosquitoes on the infected side to which the man had been exposed<lb/>
for half an hour, it was very good proof that the mosquito was the<lb/>
factor which gave yellow fever. He then said, &ldquo;Now that I have<lb/>
shown you a house infected with yellow fever, I will demonstrate<lb/>
how it can be disinfected and rendered safe.&rdquo; He then caught his<lb/>
half dozen mosquitoes, <hi>bottled</hi> them up and put them back into their<lb/>
jars, and announced that the building was entirely safe and unin-<lb/>
fected, <hi>put the two men back into the side which had been infected,<lb/>
and the four continued to sleep and live as safely in these quarters<lb/>
as they had before the infection</hi>.</p>
<p>The board had another room built and got all sorts of material<lb/>
infected by yellow-fever patients from the hospital, clothing worn by<lb/>
patients at the time they died of yellow fever, such as mattresses on<lb/>
which they died, soiled in every possible way, pillows and pillowcases<lb/>
saturated with black vomit, and blankets over which basins of black<lb/>
vomit had been poured; in short, material infected by yellow fever in<lb/>
every possible way that could be thought of. All this material was<lb/>
placed in the room, which was made close and tight with very little<lb/>
ventilation, so as to make the conditions most favorable for what was<lb/>
ordinarily considered the best way of insuring the spread of yellow<lb/>
fever. Volunteers who had never had yellow fever were placed in<lb/>
this room, lived and slept there for two weeks at a time, wore this<lb/>
clothing, slept on these mattresses, under these sheets, and yet not a<lb/>
single case of yellow fever was developed from this contact. The<lb/>
<pb n="244" id="S8220258"/>
244<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
men who had undergone this exposure were taken out and kept for<lb/>
two weeks so as to insure that they had not contracted yellow fever<lb/>
from the exposure, and then bitten by infected mosquitoes. They<lb/>
always got yellow fever from the bite of the mosquito, but never in<lb/>
any other way.</p>
<p>At this time the military authorities had had entire control of<lb/>
Habana for about two years. An Army doctor had been placed in<lb/>
charge of the health department and given the means and power to<lb/>
do what he thought most likely to free the city from yellow fever.<lb/>
Yellow fever in Habana was a disease like consumption in Galveston<lb/>
or New Orleans--always there, and always one of the principal causes<lb/>
of death in the city. And this had been the state of affairs as long as<lb/>
anything had been known with any accuracy, either about yellow<lb/>
fever or about the health conditions of Habana; and these things<lb/>
were pretty accurately known for more than a hundred years imme-<lb/>
diately preceding the time I refer to. When we organized our health<lb/>
department, we believed, as did everybody, else, that yellow fever was<lb/>
caused by filth, dirt, and general insanitary conditions, so we went<lb/>
to work doing our very best to correct these conditions. With these<lb/>
efforts Habana very rapidly became a healthy city, as much so as<lb/>
many of our large cities in the United States, but yellow fever did not<lb/>
seem to be affected.</p>
<p>The second year of our control yellow fever was very severe in<lb/>
Habana, but did not attack the native Cuban because he was generally<lb/>
acclimated. Only the foreigner, therefore, was subject to the disease.<lb/>
During the year 1900 many of our prominent American civilians and<lb/>
military officials died of the disease, and the very cleanest and best<lb/>
parts of the city and the people who lived best and took the best care<lb/>
of themselves were most affected. When the Army Board published<lb/>
their discovery to the world the health department of Habana recog-<lb/>
nized that it and all the rest of the world had been on the wrong<lb/>
track with regard to yellow fever, and they determined to change<lb/>
their methods and attack the mosquito as the cause of the disease.</p>
<p>They had been convinced by the work of the Army board that a<lb/>
human being could only get yellow fever by being bitten by a par-<lb/>
ticular kind of mosquito--the stegomyia--which had previously<lb/>
bitten a man suffering from yellow fever. They therefore arranged<lb/>
that as soon as a man sickened with yellow fever employees from the<lb/>
department went to the house and screened it with wire netting so<lb/>
that those mosquitoes that were in the house could not get out and<lb/>
those outside could not get in. A smudge was then made of sulphur,<lb/>
tobacco, or insect powder, as best suited to the circumstances, in the<lb/>
affected house, and in all those immediately around it, with the<lb/>
intention of killing all mosquitoes present. By this method it was<lb/>
hoped that both the mosquitoes that had bitten the man and caused<lb/>
the disease would be killed, and also those that had bitten the man<lb/>
after he was taken sick, and had thus become themselves infected<lb/>
and able to spread the disease. For the purpose of doing this<lb/>
screening a building was arranged very much like a fire station in one<lb/>
of our cities, where wagons, wire screens, carpenters, and men with<lb/>
material for making a smudge, were always kept on duty, who pro-<lb/>
ceeded at once to the place where a yellow fever case was reported to<lb/>
exist.</p>
<pb n="245" id="S8220259"/>
<p>YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
245</p>
<p>This method was very successful in its results. After its adoption<lb/>
very few cases occurred where the disease spread from the person<lb/>
infected to others in the neighborhood. It was also determined to<lb/>
destroy as many as possible of the yellow fever mosquitoes in the<lb/>
city. It was known that the female mosquito had to have water<lb/>
on which to lay her eggs, and that these eggs could not hatch without<lb/>
water; that this water had to be very quiet and well protected for the<lb/>
hatching process to take place; that the eggs took about three days<lb/>
to hatch; that after hatching the insect had to live the life of a fish<lb/>
in this water for five or six days. During this fish stage they are<lb/>
known as larv&aelig;, and are well known to everybody in the South, for<lb/>
they are nothing but the common wigglers always found in standing<lb/>
rain water during the summer months. Now, while in this wiggler<lb/>
stage the insect has to have air, and for this purpose must every<lb/>
little while come to the surface. At the end of five or six days the<lb/>
wiggler changes into the full-grown mosquito.</p>
<p>It is known that this particular species of mosquito--the stegomyia,<lb/>
or the yellow fever mosquito--lives and breeds almost altogether in<lb/>
houses and in their immediate neighborhood, and does not leave the<lb/>
house for any great distance. With this knowledge of its life history,<lb/>
the department found it easiest to destroy the mosquito in its wiggler<lb/>
stage, and the most useful means in this direction they found to be<lb/>
the doing away with all the little deposits of water in and near inhab-<lb/>
ited houses, which the wiggler must have in order to develop into the<lb/>
mosquito. The methods herein described were not settled upon, as<lb/>
might appear from this account, all at once and at the beginning, but<lb/>
many other methods of waging war against the mosquito were tried,<lb/>
found impracticable, and dropped.</p>
<p>With the object of doing away with the breeding places of the<lb/>
yellow-fever wiggler, all the houses and yards of Habana were carefully<lb/>
examined and all tin cans, empty bottles, and trash of the same kind,<lb/>
which were generally found filled with rain water and full of yellow<lb/>
fever mosquito larv&aelig;, were carefully carted off. Then the necessary<lb/>
openings in all cisterns were covered with mosquito netting, so that<lb/>
the mosquitoes could not get in to lay their eggs. Among the poorer<lb/>
people, who had only barrels and other similar receptacles for rain<lb/>
water (and in Habana every family had something of this kind), the<lb/>
health department arranged these necessary receptacles for them by<lb/>
placing a wooden cover on the barrel, leaving a hole in the center of<lb/>
this cover for the entrance of water, and covering the hole with wire<lb/>
netting, so that mosquitoes could not get in. To enable them to draw<lb/>
off the water without opening the barrel a cheap wooden spigot was<lb/>
placed in the lower part.</p>
<p>Now, from the peculiarity of the wiggler, that he has to come to the<lb/>
surface of the water every few seconds to get air, if we put anything<lb/>
on the surface of the water that prevents him getting this air, he<lb/>
drowns just as certainly as a man would who is kept under the water.<lb/>
Ordinary kerosene oil, a tablespoonful or two to a cistern, spreads<lb/>
over the surface of the water and kills the wiggler in this way. He<lb/>
can not break through the scum of oil to get air. But oil very rapidly<lb/>
evaporates and has frequently to be renewed. So oil was only used<lb/>
in Habana where no other method was successful. The privy pits in<lb/>
all the houses there were in the center of the court, covered generally<lb/>
with heavy flagstone. These pits, not being in general accessible to the<lb/>
<pb n="246" id="S8220260"/>
246<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
inspectors, had to be treated with oil. Once a month a couple of<lb/>
ounces of oil were poured into the pipes leading to the pits.</p>
<p>To insure that these methods and ordinances were carried out, the<lb/>
city was divided into districts of about a thousand houses each, so<lb/>
that an inspector would get over each district in the course of a month,<lb/>
inspecting at the rate of about 30 houses a day. This inspector<lb/>
had with him two men who used the oil as above described. He had<lb/>
with him printed blanks on which he entered the condition of the<lb/>
premises as to wigglers. These reports were turned in every night<lb/>
to the office of the health department and were consolidated from day<lb/>
to day. At the end of the month we could therefore tell the condition<lb/>
of Habana as to wigglers. At the first report on this subject (I think<lb/>
in March, 1901) we found that we had in Habana in the neighbor-<lb/>
hood of 26,000 different water deposits which contained wigglers,<lb/>
most of them of the yellow-fever variety.</p>
<p>After once going over the city and carefully explaining to the<lb/>
people the dangers of allowing wigglers on their premises, and after<lb/>
having fixed up for the poor all the water barrels which they were<lb/>
obliged to keep for holding their rain water, the mayor of the city<lb/>
issued an ordinance stating that anybody who bred wigglers on his<lb/>
premises would be fined $10. These two methods of destroying<lb/>
yellow fever mosquitoes, namely, that of killing the grown mosquito<lb/>
in the neighborhood of every yellow fever patient with a smudge and<lb/>
of looking after the wigglers in all rain water deposits about the house,<lb/>
were steadily enforced during the year 1901. The results were better<lb/>
than we had dared to hope. Few cases occurred in which yellow<lb/>
fever spread from a case cared for in this way. Yellow fever rapidly<lb/>
decreased, and on September 28, 1901, the last case of yellow fever<lb/>
occurred in Habana, and since that time--now more than two years--<lb/>
not a single new case has developed in the city.</p>
<p>There were still, of course, a great many yellow fever mosquitoes<lb/>
in Habana, but these methods of destroying the wigglers had greatly<lb/>
decreased the numbers of mosquitoes. The report of January, 1902,<lb/>
after about ten months of this mosquito work, showed that within<lb/>
the city limits less than 300 premises had wigglers upon them. This<lb/>
I think a very fair measure of the results accomplished by one year's<lb/>
work, namely, that the number of deposits containing wigglers had<lb/>
been decreased from about 26,000 to about 300.</p>
<p>I think it is evident that the disappearance of yellow fever from<lb/>
Habana was due solely to this mosquito work. Remember that it<lb/>
was an every-day disease in Habana, and had been so for more than<lb/>
a hundred years, just as consumption is in New Orleans, a city of<lb/>
about the same size as Habana. Now, if some method should be<lb/>
adopted against consumption in New Orleans, and systematically<lb/>
put in operation in the city against that disease, and at the end of a<lb/>
year it could be shown that no new cases of consumption were occur-<lb/>
ring in New Orleans, and at the end of two years and a half it could<lb/>
be further shown that under the continuance of the same measures<lb/>
the disease had entirely disappeared from the city, and no new cases<lb/>
had occurred, I should think that we would all be at once convinced<lb/>
that the disappearance of consumption from New Orleans was due to<lb/>
the efficacy of the measures adopted.</p>
<p>In Habana, even now, a case or two of yellow fever comes in every<lb/>
month from Mexico and other infected regions which have a con-<lb/>
<pb n="247" id="S8220261"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
247<lb/>
siderable trade with Habana. The ships are carefully inspected by<lb/>
the quarantine authorities, just as is done in our country. If a<lb/>
person sick of yellow fever, or suspected yellow fever, is discovered,<lb/>
he is landed at the city wharf, in the heart of the business district,<lb/>
placed in an ambulance, carried to the yellow fever hospital, which<lb/>
is well within the city limits, and treated there. The only precau-<lb/>
tion taken is to see that Habana mosquitoes do not get an oppor-<lb/>
tunity to bite him. The authorities at Habana thoroughly believe<lb/>
that if they can prevent mosquitoes from biting a yellow fever patient<lb/>
the city will be entirely safe in handling him and taking care of him.</p>
<p>In 1901, during the height of the yellow fever work at Habana, a<lb/>
town of about 5,000 inhabitants, some 12 miles from the city, became<lb/>
badly infected with yellow fever. This town, Santiago de las Vegas,<lb/>
was practically a suburb of Habana, and the business communication<lb/>
with the city was very intimate. We found that people who were<lb/>
working at Santiago de las Vegas were constantly getting sick of<lb/>
yellow fever, and as soon as they found themselves sick would come<lb/>
into Habana to the homes of their friends and relatives to be taken<lb/>
care of. In order to do away with this source of danger, a large force<lb/>
of men was put at work at Las Vegas, on the lines above described.<lb/>
The whole town was systematically gone through from house to house,<lb/>
and at the end of about six weeks of this work the disease was entirely<lb/>
wiped out and we had no more trouble with infection from Las Vegas.<lb/>
I mention this as showing the possibility of taking a small town and<lb/>
getting rid of the disease rapidly by mosquito work.</p>
<p>We had other mosquito work going on in the suburbs of Habana,<lb/>
among the truck gardens and irrigated fields where grass was grown.<lb/>
But the yellow-fever mosquito does not breed to any great extent in<lb/>
such places, and I do not think this work had much effect upon the<lb/>
yellow fever. But malaria, as I have above mentioned, is also carried<lb/>
exclusively by a mosquito named the &ldquo;anopheles.&rdquo; Now, this malarial<lb/>
mosquito likes to breed in places where there are little puddles of<lb/>
water, cow tracks, horse tracks, and similar depressions in grassy<lb/>
ground, and the work in the suburbs had its principal effect upon this<lb/>
mosquito. It was not desirable to stop irrigation, as the livelihood of<lb/>
all these small farmers depend upon it, but by taking advantage of<lb/>
the fact that a deposit of water had to remain undisturbed at least 10<lb/>
days to breed a mosquito, we could allow them to irrigate freely, pro-<lb/>
vided the water did not remain longer than a week. The health de-<lb/>
partment had all this area arranged with shallow, superficial ditches<lb/>
which would not interfere with irrigation, but would allow rapid<lb/>
drainage when the water was taken off. All pools and puddles which<lb/>
had no economic use were kept drained, and ditches and streams kept<lb/>
clean of grass and obstructions.</p>
<p>After once getting the country cleaned up at public expense, and<lb/>
the matter explained to the farmer, he was fined in the same way as<lb/>
the householder in the built-up portion of the city, if wigglers were<lb/>
discovered on his premises. While I do not think that these measures<lb/>
aided us particularly in yellow fever, they had a marked effect upon<lb/>
malaria. In 1900, the year before the mosquito work commenced, we<lb/>
had in Habana 325 deaths from malaria. During 1901, the year in<lb/>
which mosquito work was commenced, we had 151 deaths from<lb/>
malaria. In 1902, the second year of mosquito work, Dr. Carlos<lb/>
Finlay, the health officer of Cuba, reported 77 deaths from malaria in<lb/>
<pb n="248" id="S8220262"/>
248<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
Habana, and up to the 1st of November in 1903, the third year of<lb/>
mosquito work, Dr. Finlay reported 45 deaths from malaria.</p>
<p>This mosquito work of the Habana health department, I hold,<lb/>
demonstrates the practicability of eliminating in the Tropics the two<lb/>
diseases malaria and yellow fever, and I believe if the attention of the<lb/>
people at large in our own country were generally attracted to the<lb/>
danger of transmitting disease by the mosquito, and the practicability<lb/>
of destroying them, we could very generally eliminate these two<lb/>
diseases from our own country.</p>
<p>And now to the reason for writing this article. I thought an account<lb/>
of the relations of mosquitoes to disease, given in simple terms, readily<lb/>
understood by those who are not doctors, might held people generally<lb/>
in making an attempt to get rid of mosquitoes, each man about his<lb/>
own house. I will now proceed to make suggestions in this direction.<lb/>
And in order to make myself entirely clear will repeat a good deal,<lb/>
and enlarge upon what I have already said.</p>
<p>The work of the Army medical board of which Maj. Walter Reed<lb/>
was president, showing that a particular species of mosquito was the<lb/>
only means of transmitting yellow fever, is now pretty generally<lb/>
accepted by all the scientific world. Based upon this knowledge,<lb/>
certain methods were adopted by the Army medical officers in Habana,<lb/>
Cuba, which resulted in eradicating yellow fever from that city.<lb/>
During the fall of 1903 yellow fever was introduced from Mexico and<lb/>
became quite widely spread through western Texas. It is thought<lb/>
that a few general rules, based upon the knowledge acquired by the<lb/>
Army board and the experience of the Army medical officers in Habana,<lb/>
may be of use in assisting individuals and towns in freeing themselves<lb/>
from infected mosquitoes during the present winter and coming<lb/>
spring. Otherwise, it seems highly probable that yellow fever, at<lb/>
some point in Texas, will again develop as the warm weather comes on.<lb/>
This would come about from the fact that the infected mosquito can<lb/>
very readily live through the winter in the latitude of Laredo.</p>
<p>As yellow fever can only be spread by a particular species of mos-<lb/>
quito, it follows that if there are none of these mosquitoes about,<lb/>
yellow fever can not spread. The danger in Texas is that the steg-<lb/>
omyia mosquitoes, that have bitten people with yellow fever, will live<lb/>
through the winter and spread another epidemic as the warm weather<lb/>
comes on by biting people who have not had the disease. This mos-<lb/>
quito, from its nature, stays immediately about the house and in the<lb/>
rooms, and seldom or never wanders far. It was found in Habana<lb/>
that by destroying all the mosquitoes in each house where yellow<lb/>
fever occurred the disease was always stopped in that particular<lb/>
neighborhood. It is probable, therefore, that if each householder in<lb/>
whose house yellow fever has occurred during the past fall will<lb/>
destroy all the mosquitoes in his house he will be free from the old<lb/>
infection next spring. This can readily be done by closing the room<lb/>
and making a smudge in it of sulphur or tobacco. Care should be<lb/>
taken to paste all the cracks up with paper, so that the smudge will<lb/>
be confined to the room fumigated, and the pan in which the smudge<lb/>
is made placed on a little earth, so that it can not set the floor on fire.</p>
<p>With sulphur, about a pound to a room 10 feet square, should be<lb/>
used, and with tobacco, about half a pound. To start the sulphur<lb/>
burning a couple of tablespoonfuls of alcohol should be poured on<lb/>
before applying the match. Sulphur should be used unless the room<lb/>
<pb n="249" id="S8220263"/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
249<lb/>
contains valuable material which might be injured by it. The fumes<lb/>
of tobacco hurt nothing, but leave a disagreeable odor. The fumes<lb/>
of ordinary Persian insect powder hurt nothing and leave no odor, but<lb/>
it does not always kill the mosquitoes and care has to be taken to<lb/>
sweep them up afterwards. A couple of hours will be time enough to<lb/>
keep the room closed. After that time it can be opened, aired, and<lb/>
occupied. In towns, this method should be carefully carried out dur-<lb/>
ing the winter by the town authorities. Not only the houses in which<lb/>
yellow fever is known to have occurred, but every house in the infected<lb/>
town should be treated in this way. We found in Habana that a squad<lb/>
of five men, under intelligent direction, could easily fumigate a 10-<lb/>
room house in two hours. It should be arranged so that the whole of<lb/>
the infected town should be gone over before the 1st of April.</p>
<p>The above directions cover the points with regard to killing infected<lb/>
mosquitoes, and thereby preventing the liability of a new epidemic<lb/>
next summer from the old mosquitoes left over from last year. But<lb/>
it is even more important to prevent the breeding of a new crop of<lb/>
stegomyia mosquitoes, and this can be very readily done without very<lb/>
great effort.</p>
<p>The female stegomyia mosquito always seeks some small body of<lb/>
well-protected fresh water in which to lay her eggs. On the surface<lb/>
of this water she lays about 60 or 70 eggs. These, in warm weather,<lb/>
in three days hatch out into the ordinary wiggler, and the wiggler in<lb/>
five or six days develops into the full-grown mosquito. From the<lb/>
laying of the egg to the development of the full-grown mosquito takes<lb/>
about eight days in hot weather. Water is as necessary to the insect<lb/>
as it is to a fish. It is essentially a water insect during this period,<lb/>
though it is an air-breathing insect, too, and has to come to the surface<lb/>
of the water every few seconds to get air.</p>
<p>As I stated above, the stegomyia seeks particularly deposits of clean<lb/>
water, and is essentially a house mosquito, breeding either in the<lb/>
house or very close to it, in such places as cisterns and rain-water bar-<lb/>
rels, and in anything likely to catch and retain rain water, such as old<lb/>
bottles or cans, or gutters under the roofs of houses, etc. Now, if<lb/>
every householder will give a little attention to see that there are no<lb/>
such deposits about his house, he will be free from the stegomyia mos-<lb/>
quito, and no one will contract yellow fever in his house, even if cases<lb/>
are introduced into it from elsewhere. If necessity obliges him to<lb/>
keep a cistern or barrels of rain water, if he will arrange the receptacle<lb/>
so that the mosquito can not get in to lay her eggs, it will be entirely<lb/>
safe. In the cistern this can be done by covering the top tightly, with<lb/>
the exception of a hole for ventilation, and one for the entrance of the<lb/>
water, and these two holes should be covered with wire netting. The<lb/>
netting should be not larger than 16 meshes to the inch. A larger<lb/>
mesh than this will allow the smaller size of stegomyia to pass through.</p>
<p>Water barrels can be arranged in the same way, a tight-fitting top<lb/>
put on, with a wire mesh over the hole for the entrance of the water,<lb/>
and a cheap spigot put in the bottom for drawing off water. If he<lb/>
finds wigglers in any of the vessels of water which he is obliged to<lb/>
keep, he can know that his cover is imperfect, and that the female<lb/>
mosquito has gotten in there in some way to lay her eggs. Small<lb/>
deposits about the yard and in the immediate neighborhood should be<lb/>
swept out or drained away. A deposit of water in Texas would have<lb/>
to stand at least 10 days to breed a mosquito. For this reason, if the<lb/>

250<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER.<lb/>
householder is not able to arrange his water vessels as above sug-<lb/>
gested he could avoid breeding stegomyia mosquitoes by having these<lb/>
vessels emptied once a week. But if the method of emptying is used,<lb/>
the larv&aelig; should be carefully washed out or the vessel left to stand<lb/>
empty for more than an hour. If this precaution is not taken, a con-<lb/>
siderable number of the larv&aelig; will be left adherent to the bottom and<lb/>
sides and will live if the vessel is at once refilled. Kerosene oil is<lb/>
fatal to the larv&aelig; if two or three tablespoonfuls are spread over the<lb/>
surface of the water.</p>
<p>As I said before, the larv&aelig; have to come to the surface every few<lb/>
seconds to get air, and as they are unable to break through the film<lb/>
of oil they die of suffocation, but the oil evaporates very rapidly and<lb/>
should be renewed every week. Much the better method is either to<lb/>
get rid of the deposit of water or protect it in the above-mentioned<lb/>
manner. Oil should only be relied upon in treating deposits in a<lb/>
building or its immediate neighborhood which can not be managed in<lb/>
one of the above-mentioned methods. Privy pits which contain water<lb/>
were the only places in Habana in which we habitually resorted to oil.</p>
<p>In towns these methods should be enforced by regular and syste-<lb/>
matic inspections. In most towns there are ordinances against pigs<lb/>
and pigsties. A hog is considerably larger than a mosquito wiggler,<lb/>
but with a little care an inspector will soon learn to discover the wig-<lb/>
glers almost as easily as the hogs. And the householder should be<lb/>
taught that the wiggler causes a great deal more annoyance to himself<lb/>
and his neighbors than the hog does, and is infinitely more dangerous<lb/>
to health. And the ordinances should hold the householder as strictly<lb/>
to account for breeding wigglers on his premises as for having a pigsty<lb/>
with a litter of pigs. The larger deposits, a hundred yards or more<lb/>
away from the house, such as small ponds and swampy places, while<lb/>
breeding mosquitoes that cause a great deal of annoyance, will not<lb/>
breed the stegomyia to an extent sufficient to be dangerous to the<lb/>
house. They should be managed by the town authorities on the same<lb/>
general principles--to drain wherever possible.</p>
