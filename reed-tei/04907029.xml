JESSIE DANIEL AMES<lb/>
THE WREN'S NEST<lb/>
TRYON, N. C.<lb/>
<dateline>
<date value="1956-05-26">26 May, 1956</date>
</dateline><lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I returned to Tryon late yesterday evening after a two weeks' absence<lb/>
from the state. So the information which you asked for, and which I<lb/>
am sending you, may be too late for your purposes. Naturally, I re-<lb/>
gret this delay.</p>
<p>I agree with you that Mr. Lambert is greatly distressed by the turn<lb/>
of events which makes it seem that he might have been instrumental<lb/>
in the exclusion of my husband's name from the &ldquo;Lambert&rdquo; bill. The<lb/>
one thing that has kept the frail old man alive has been his faith<lb/>
that &ldquo;justice will prevail&rdquo; if he continued the campaign. His loy-<lb/>
alty to my husband has always touched me deeply.</p>
<p>My limited service in getting bills through legislative bodies leads<lb/>
me to believe that an amendment to an already passed bill by one<lb/>
house stands a better chance of final passage than does a new bill.</p>
<p>The two men in the Yellow Fever experiment in Cuba for whom my hus-<lb/>
band had the greatest admirationwere Major Reed and Captain Lazear.<lb/>
Major Reed has been adequately meorialized, I believe. I do agree<lb/>
with you that something should me done to bring the name of Captain<lb/>
Lazear prominently before the public, or before the medical profess-<lb/>
ion. I would like Proposition 1 passed for this reason.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am for any one of the four which can be passed<lb/>
by the Congress. I want Mr. Lambert to die in the knowledge that<lb/>
his services have been recognized and that his faith has been justified.<lb/>
I wish that Proposition 4 could be passed. Mr. Lambert has worked<lb/>
for this particular recognition, and as the years have passed and<lb/>
he has grownold and feeble and nearly blind, he could have built up<lb/>
a greater conception of the value of his services all out of pro-<lb/>
potion to your evaluation of them.</p>
<p>I know that I have done this in relation to my husband's record. That<lb/>
is, out of proportion to the value which Major Kean, General Ireland,<lb/>
General Truby and others attributed to his record. I would like this<lb/>
recognition only in part for myself. For the most part, I want it for<lb/>
my children, two of whom are doctors, and for my grandson to whom<lb/>
my son has talked about his grandfather's work in &ldquo; wiping out the<lb/>
scourge of yellow fever.&rdquo; But then you know how much I do want this<lb/>
official recognition.</p>
<p>I shall write to Senators Ervin and Scott and Congressman Jones as<lb/>
soon as I know the number of the bill and its status in the Senate.<lb/>
In committee, pigeon holed or under consideration? I take it that<lb/>
it is not pigeoholed.</p>
<p>I like hearing from you again. You never sent me the pictures you<lb/>
took at Quemados in 1952. You wrote that you would.</p>
