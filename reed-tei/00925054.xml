<p>Williams believes that the malaria abstracts require Carter's comments to be useful.  He has been filming locations that need draining as part of the anti-malaria campaign.</p>

Dr. H. R. Carter,<lb/>
2121 California St. N. W.,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Escuse my delay in answering yours of the 14th<lb/>
but it came while I was on leave of absence moving into my new<lb/>
home at 3111 Stuart Avenue and immediately following I was com-<lb/>
pelled to take a trip to Smithfield, Virginia.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think the present method of abstract-<lb/>
ing malaria articles is advisable. I do not think that a sim-<lb/>
ple abstract would do nearly as well as the abstract with comments.</p>
<p>I reason thus <del><unclear></unclear></del>: I suspect that I am perhaps<lb/>
what might be termed the average reader of these abstracts. I<lb/>
figure that they are for my benefit. I must admit that without<lb/>
your critical comments I would very frequently be unable to deter-<lb/>
mine how much dependence could be placed on the accuracy and value<lb/>
of the articles. Of course for Mr. LePrince and perhaps Mr.<lb/>
Mayne these comments may at times be superfluous but for the average<lb/>
reader they are essential.</p>
<p>In reading these articles I can easily see the<lb/>
work you have put on them. From my point of view it is work well<lb/>
worth while.</p>
<p>My mind is open and I will keep my eyes in simi-<lb/>
lar condition <unclear>anont</unclear> the protective influence of stock against<lb/>
malaria, also I think I can make some observations on the &ldquo;<del><unclear>humn</unclear></del>homing-<lb/>
instinct&rdquo; as you call it of A.quad., for in this work in <del><unclear></unclear></del>rural<lb/>
Virginia in at least two counties rather careful house-to-house<lb/>
surveys have been started and would show prevalence or absence<lb/>
of multiple cases of malaria to a home.</p>
<p>I helped Dr. Kane (State and I. H. B. man) in<lb/>
putting across his antimalaria appropriation at Smithfield, Virginia,<lb/>
in what to me was a distinctly unique method. I carried a movie<lb/>
operative to the town and we took moving pictures of all the places<lb/>
needing drainage and took care to show the Mayor and City Council<lb/>
plus <add><unclear>m</unclear></add>any of the leading citizens in the act of examining these spots.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00925055"/>
-2-<lb/>
A week later at a big mass meeting at night we showed them a movie<lb/>
of their own town and the exact conditions needing correction.<lb/>
It certainly went over with a whoop. When the work is done we will<lb/>
set up the camera at the identical spots from which the first shots<lb/>
were made and thus complete a &ldquo;Before and After&rdquo; picture. The only<lb/>
drawback to doing this every time is that the picture costs $300.<lb/>
However, it paid us in Smithfield because we wanted a &ldquo;Before and<lb/>
After&rdquo; picture with a local significance for Virginia anyway and<lb/>
chose Smithfield because this town was considered to be the hardest<lb/>
mut to crack.</p>
<p>Mother is with me now and Dad I am expecting in<lb/>
a day or two. After an absence of seven years I must say that<lb/>
Mother seems hardly changed at all. Louis III races all over the<lb/>
house on all fours and cuts capers and teeth with great regularity.<lb/>
Gertrude joins me in love to you and Laura.</p>

<salute>Very sincerely,</salute>

P. A. Surgeon</signed>.
