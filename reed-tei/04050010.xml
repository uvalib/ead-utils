<salute>My dear Mr. Macia:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Some weeks ago, before the recent hurricane, I got worried about<lb/>
the little building at Camp Lazear. I am so fearful, lest it be damaged<lb/>
further by the weather. I wrote to Mr. Moran, asking if he, as my agent,<lb/>
would contact you, to see if something might be done about erecting a<lb/>
protective frame to enclose completely the little building. I hate to<lb/>
discommode anyone who might be living in the little shack, but the little<lb/>
building is of such historical significance that I felt emboldened to<lb/>
suggest that it be cared for properly, and I wish to help in the expense<lb/>
of its protection.</p>
<p>Mr. Moran does not have an automobile, and I fear that I have im-<lb/>
posed already greatly on his time. When I heard of the recent hurricane,<lb/>
I did really become alarmed. Mr. Moran has not had the occasion to write<lb/>
to me but I sincerely hope that the little building is still intact and<lb/>
has not suffered the fate of its companion building, which crashed in<lb/>
the hurricane of 1926.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, in New York, I had the privilege of meeting Doctor<lb/>
Ramos, and we discussed the proper protection of the little building.<lb/>
I would appreciate it greatly if you would let me know whether it would<lb/>
be feasible to erect a strong outer shell, completely enveloping the<lb/>
little building. My original thought, before I heard of the hurricane,<lb/>
was that this shell would be of strong planking and tar paper, but in<lb/>
view of the hurricane, I wonder whether it would not be much better to<lb/>
erect some sort of a semi-permanent shell, made either of brick (perhaps<lb/>
old secondhand brick, cheaply bought) or other suitable semi-permanent<lb/>
material which might probably withstand a hurricane. I have no idea<lb/>
how much the erection of such an outer protective shell would cost in<lb/>
Cuba. I do have a small personal fund available and would be very grate-<lb/>
ful indeed if, from your busy hours, you could give me a little time to<lb/>
discuss this matter. My Army address is as given at the head of the letter.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
