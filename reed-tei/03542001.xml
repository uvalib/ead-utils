Senor Luis Pogolotti<lb/>
Calle Cuba #3<lb/>
Havana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Senor Pogolotti:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You will wonder why I have not written before. I found much work piled on<lb/>
my desk on my return and almost at once there was a medical convention here which<lb/>
necessitated my having a house guest. On top of that, my nine-year old boy developed<lb/>
acute appendicitis and was operated upon, but he is now recovering nicely.</p>
<p>I cannot thank you enough for all of the courtesies you showed to me. It<lb/>
was a continual surprise to me how interested you were in my problem, and you were<lb/>
certainly wonderfully helpful. As you know, I am writing up my report, one copy to<lb/>
go to the President of Washington and Jefferson College, one to the United States<lb/>
Army Medical Museum, Washington, D. C. and one to be sent to Dr. Ramos, Secretary for<lb/>
Defense, at his request. I am anxious to get the copies of the two maps when they<lb/>
are available, and I left a little sum of money in Mr. Moran's hands. Please call<lb/>
on him for the expenses incident to having these maps copied.</p>
<p>I wondered if you got the &ldquo;Informes&rdquo; from Ramos' secretary. I have not yet<lb/>
received my copies.</p>
<p>Did you know that Mr. Moran called the Chief Engineer of the Havana Rail-<lb/>
road, who identified the age of the railroad track by the Carnin<del>n</del>o Camp Lazear as<lb/>
being built around 1865? When you have time, I should appreciate also your writing<lb/>
me a more or less formal statement as to your ownership of the property at the<lb/>
Carninno Camp Lazear and your former ownership of part of the San Jose farm. I<lb/>
should appreciate it if you would state when your brother purchased this, to whom it<lb/>
was sold, etc., giving dates and if possible a record of the deed so that we would<lb/>
have a formal official statement, or at least know where information might be found<lb/>
as to ownership.</p>
<p>I wonder if you would identify the white building in the photograph, which<lb/>
I have marked. Is it the side of the Military Hospital or of one of the units of the<lb/>
Military Hospital, or what building is it? I never got that point straight in my<lb/>
mind, as we went by the Military Hospital so fast in the car. I refer to the white<lb/>
building which one sees in the picture, as one <unclear>faces</unclear> the railroad track in front of<lb/>
the Carnin<del><unclear>n</unclear></del>o Camp Lazear tree. If you want any more copies of these pictures, I shall<lb/>
be only too glad to send them to you, and let me say again how invaluable your help<lb/>
was to me. I can never thank you enough.</p>
<p>I will, of course, send you a copy of my report, and will probably have to<lb/>
call upon you for some other help from time to time. It was so nice of you to come<lb/>
down to the plane to see us off. Mrs. Hench and I appreciated it very greatly.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
