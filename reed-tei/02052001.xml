<p>Well, to be<lb/>
sure the dear lady of dear<lb/>
Keewaydin is surpassing<lb/>
herself! Two sweet letters<lb/>
again, to-day -- those of June<lb/>
27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and they were both<lb/>
just as interesting as they could<lb/>
be. I didn't exactly relish about<lb/>
being told of that Snap-bean<lb/>
and potato salad, as it made<lb/>
my mouth a little moist!<lb/>
Still, I am glad to know that<lb/>
my sweet girls enjoyed it<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02052002"/>
so much. Those strawberry<lb/>
preserves, also, touched a<lb/>
very <hi>tender spot</hi>! So, old Mr<lb/>
Keewaydin has been calling<lb/>
occasionally, has he? He is<lb/>
apt to call now and then- Here<lb/>
the South wind is the most<lb/>
important breeze and it is sur-<lb/>
prising how cool &amp; refreshing<lb/>
it is. What you told me<lb/>
about the shower and the grow-<lb/>
ing plants was so interes-<lb/>
ting- I can see the dear place<lb/>
&amp; everything as it is just as<lb/>
if I were there! I know that<lb/>
Grape Arbor must begin to<lb/>
look so pretty- Have you yet<lb/>
had snap-beans from your<lb/>
own vines? I can hardly<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02052003"/>
think so- That you could<lb/>
find any new potatoes was<lb/>
really surprising, as I had thought<lb/>
that you would yet have to<lb/>
wait a week or moore.<lb/>
Tell Jacob that the heavy<lb/>
shower patted that earth<lb/>
down <add>on the corn</add> and not my hoe-<lb/>
If he will work the corn<lb/>
every week, pulling the earth<lb/>
to it some, you will soon<lb/>
see how fast it will<lb/>
grow- Don't eat it all up<lb/>
before I get there- We get<lb/>
none here, although it should<lb/>
be raised in abundance.<lb/>
A small cabbage, literally<lb/>
no bigger than your fist, costs<lb/>
15 to 25 cts! Every vegetable<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02052004"/>
is dreadfully expensive in<lb/>
Cuba- Even potatoes, and<lb/>
bananas are hardly cheaper<lb/>
than in the U.S. Pineapples<lb/>
are very good and not<lb/>
unreasonable in price- So<lb/>
you are still picking berries<lb/>
from the patch? It won't<lb/>
be long before you will<lb/>
begin to have raspberries<lb/>
and black-berries- You must<lb/>
put down the <hi>date</hi> when you<lb/>
get your first ones- Per-<lb/>
haps, after all, roses will<lb/>
grow well at our dear<lb/>
home- Certainly Mrs. <unclear>Roach's</unclear><lb/>
looked splendidly- Hurrah<lb/>
for the festive family of blue-<lb/>
birds! They are more at-<lb/>
tached to people than I had thought.</p>
<pb n="5" id="f02052005"/>
<p>P.S. I think that you had<lb/>
better <hi>mail</hi> your deposit<lb/>
book to Mr C. J. Meyers<lb/>
Army Medical Museum,<lb/>
&amp; ask him to have Beech-<lb/>
ner take it to Riggs Bank<lb/>
&amp; get my June pay, <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>339.67,<lb/>
credited to your account,<lb/>
&amp; then remail the Deposit<lb/>
book to you- I left the<lb/>
pay accounts with the<lb/>
paymaster &amp; he promised<lb/>
to place the am't. to your<lb/>
Credit, June 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, but it<lb/>
is just as well to have<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02052006"/>
the Credit entered on your<lb/>
Book- What a beautiful<lb/>
Morning this is after the<lb/>
beautiful rain of last<lb/>
evening- Here I sit in<lb/>
my Pajamas while the<lb/>
delicious breeze is so<lb/>
cool that I must close<lb/>
my windows to shut it<lb/>
out- Presently I shall go<lb/>
in to the dining-room &amp; re-<lb/>
gale myself on the tooth-<lb/>
some mango -- Boo! Boo!<lb/>
to you fat farmer-lady and<lb/>
chubby little Dog-Trainer-<lb/>
Devotedly, Papa
Do I write often<lb/>
<hi>enough</hi>?<lb/>
<hi>Boo</hi>!!</p>

<p>Would you believe,<lb/>
lovie, dear, that your<lb/>
old Mr Mantee overslept<lb/>
himself, this morning, and that<lb/>
it is now 6,30 o'clock a,m,?<lb/>
I have just had my delicious<lb/>
shower bath and must hurry<lb/>
&amp; finish my letter before<lb/>
7 o'clock, as the Postman<lb/>
comes promptly at that<lb/>
hour- I can scarcely be-<lb/>
lieve that it was <hi>two</hi>(2)<lb/>
weeks ago, this afternoon,<lb/>
that I said good-bye to<lb/>
Fat Farmer lady &amp; plump<lb/>
piano-player at dear Kee-<lb/>
waydin- The time here sim-<lb/>
ply flies- I never saw<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02051006"/>
anything like it- While I<lb/>
think of it, and to return<lb/>
to farming, I think that if<lb/>
it becomes dry, you will<lb/>
have to let Jacob pull<lb/>
some of the leaves &amp; manure<lb/>
back around the little fruit-<lb/>
trees, as it serves as a<lb/>
mulch &amp; to protect their<lb/>
roots in hot weather.<lb/>
It was all right to have<lb/>
them nicely worked around<lb/>
and you were a dear, smart<lb/>
farmer lady to have thought<lb/>
about it. Now, lovie, dear,<lb/>
you know that the supposed<lb/>
Holy-hock that I planted<lb/>
was <hi>not a Squash</hi>? What<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02051007"/>
kind of a squash? Not a<lb/>
regular, old fashioned <hi><unclear>cim-<lb/>
lin</unclear></hi>? I don't believe it!<lb/>
The word &ldquo;rustler&rdquo; is<lb/>
proper &amp; in correct form,<lb/>
but it does not sufficient-<lb/>
ly describe Johnnie Moore's<lb/>
movements- You should have<lb/>
said that he was a <hi>Hust-<lb/>
ler</hi> from Hustlerville!<lb/>
How does the fence look, now<lb/>
that he has built a con-<lb/>
siderable part of it?<lb/>
Be certain to point out<lb/>
to him that beautiful plant,<lb/>
and don't let him destroy<lb/>
it- Am glad that auntie<lb/>
will soon be on the Mountain.<lb/>
you never told me what<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02051008"/>
decision Mr Moore came<lb/>
to<del>o</del> as to the <hi>pony</hi>- Did he<lb/>
take it? or did you return<lb/>
it to Cap't. Norwood? Has<lb/>
Blossom returned Mary's<lb/>
call yet? She certainly should<lb/>
do it- I know that your<lb/>
morning at dear Keewaydin<lb/>
cannot be any more beau-<lb/>
tiful than it is here, this<lb/>
morning, and the beautiful,<lb/>
blue ocean is so lovely<lb/>
to look at- You <hi>must</hi> come<lb/>
down &amp; take a peep next<lb/>
January- It's nearly seven,<lb/>
Love &amp; Kisses for my sweet<lb/>
Farmer lady and dear little<lb/>
chicken-raiser- Regards to<lb/>
Jacob, Cora &amp; Carrie- write-often.<lb/>
Boo! Boo!</p>
