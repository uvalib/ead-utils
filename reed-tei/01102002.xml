<salute>My dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of May 3rd arrived yesterday and in order to lessen dis-<lb/>
tance delay I am replying promptly, only setting down what little knowledge<lb/>
I have in my head.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes, until 1829, were unknown <unclear>to</unclear> the Hawaiians. The missionaries<lb/>
came in 1820 and the mosquitoes nine years later. I believe that the latter<lb/>
have been by far the greater pest but certain authorities seem to question this.<lb/>
However they have both been present since that date. The vessel which first<lb/>
brought mosquitoes here is perfectly well known and came from the west coast of<lb/>
Mexico, calling at the <unclear>then</unclear> important whaling port of Lahaina, on the island<lb/>
of Maui. From there thay soon spread to the remaining islands of the group.<lb/>
It is interesting to note that the Hawaiians had no word in <unclear>their</unclear> language for<lb/>
mosquito and the nearest they could come to the English pronunciation was<lb/>
&ldquo;<unclear>makik&aacute;</unclear>&rdquo;, so that that word is now Hawaiian for mosquito.</p>
<p>In many sections of the Islands conditions for mosquito development<lb/>
have been ideal. There are large swampy areas, until recently even in the<lb/>
midst of the city of Honolulu, and there are even swamps on the mountain tops.<lb/>
Rice has been, and still is, cultivated extensively and in the older days every<lb/>
Hawaiian had his taro patch, this vegetable being grown in much the same manner<lb/>
as rice. Householders depended upon barrels for their water supply, and do<lb/>
yet to a certain extent. There is no marked seasonal inhibition as the ther-<lb/>
mometer at sea-level seldom gets below sixty. Dragon flies are plentiful, in<lb/>
fact I think they are more numerous here than in any place I have ever been,<lb/>
and they must account for the destruction of large numbers of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware we have never had but three varieties. Aedes<lb/>
aegypti, Culex fatigans, and I think, altho I am not sure, S. scutellaris.<lb/>
Some two or three years ago in an old report I read that Aedes aegypti made<lb/>
up about ten per cent of the mosquito population. Perhaps the percentage has<lb/>
since decreased or possibly the original estimate was in error; certainly they<lb/>
seem to be plentiful enough at present. Anopheles have never been intro-<lb/>
duced, a strange fact, even after making due allowance for their habits.<lb/>
Ideal conditions for their propagation exist on all the islands and if a pair<lb/>
of them could find their way on some vessel at a California or other port,<lb/>
or stow away in a trunk, malaria in a short time would be rampant. Have you<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01102003"/>
an explanation to offer? I have always thought that some day they would be<lb/>
introduced. I might add that everything else under God's green heavens has<lb/>
found a refuge here, to the great detriment of the agricultural interests, but<lb/>
of late years a very strict plant quarantine has been maintained. Roses were<lb/>
everywhere in former days but the Japanese beetle came in and now it is almost<lb/>
impossible to grow them except under an electric light. And so it is with the<lb/>
leaf hopper, the cane borer and the <unclear>Mediterranean</unclear> fruit fly. As fast as they<lb/>
have arrived, however, the planters have sent their entomologists to all parts<lb/>
of the world in search of their natural enemies and the success of the sugar<lb/>
industry to-day is the outcome of their investigations. But I am digressing.<lb/>
I was referring to malaria. The practitioners here never see it and when an<lb/>
imported case does come to their attention it is seldom diagnosed immediately.<lb/>
One of our officers had an interesting case of fever some time ago. Half a<lb/>
dozen of the <unclear>physisians</unclear> in town saw it and all sorts of diagnoses were entered,<lb/>
<unclear>enteris</unclear>, sepsis, sinus trouble, etc. Parasites were plentiful. On the other<lb/>
hand the doctors here recognize leprosy when they see it and when one of them<lb/>
goes to a skin clinic in the East he can often point out, even to the derma-<lb/>
tologists, cases of leprosy which have been treated for something else.</p>
<p>As to yellow fever, we have never had a case except the two, which you<lb/>
know more about than I. Dengue, however, has been present and a dozen or more<lb/>
years ago an epidemic of several thousand cases swept the Islands. Can you<lb/>
conceive of any reason why yellow fever should not do likewise? Aedes must be<lb/>
present in all coast towns, although lacking information furnished by a survey<lb/>
this statement may appear a bit wild. Still, I think it is a reasonable con-<lb/>
clusion. It would be interesting to see at what levels they were found, for<lb/>
as you know, our coast is narrow and we have mountains that reach about as high<lb/>
as any in the states. As far as yellow fever is concerned our greatest danger<lb/>
probably comes from the west coast of Mexico. Vessels coming up from Panama<lb/>
and the west coast of South America frequently call at Manzanillo and other<lb/>
ports but we are continuing our precautions.</p>
<p>For some time I have had a suspicion that filariasis was more or less<lb/>
indigenous. Of course we meet with occasional cases in Filipinos and Asiatics<lb/>
but I would not be surprised if it were even more common. No survey has ever<lb/>
been made, as far as I am aware. Perhaps if this were done we might find a<lb/>
situation such as exists around old Charleston. I neglected to mention that<lb/>
several years ago Doctor Ludlow, who receives specimens from the Army sent from<lb/>
here, thought that she had an Anopheles. The specimen was macerated and she<lb/>
was unable to decide definitely. According to Colonel Craig, who is now here,<lb/>
this incident has been repeated recently. I have not seen Craig to question<lb/>
him regarding it but I would suggest, inasmuch as you are in Washington, that<lb/>
you call up Doctor Ludlow and ascertain the facts from her. It is of course a<lb/>
matter of great importance to us.</p>
<p>Our station stenographer is on leave and this affair I fear is rambling.<lb/>
I wish too it<unclear>mxx</unclear> were a trifle more scientific. Perhaps though you can get a<lb/>
general impression of our situation. When I sit down to a machine I am apt to<lb/>
write much as I would talk, making mention of this, that, and the other. I note<lb/>
that you sign yourself &ldquo;on waiting orders&rdquo;. That being the case couldn't you<lb/>
find time to run out this way and look us over? I know of no more attractive<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01102004"/>
spot. Once since I have been here the thermometer has reached 85.5 and the<lb/>
coldest I have seen it at Honolulu has been 60, not an extensive range as you<lb/>
will note. People find it a bit depressing after a time and usually go to the<lb/>
coast to recuperate but it is nothing like the tropics.</p>
<p>With very kind regards,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
