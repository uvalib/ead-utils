<salute>My dear Mother,-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of June 23<lb/>
came the other day with an enormous<lb/>
stack of papers, for besides the<lb/>
Pittsburgh and New York papers that you<lb/>
sent, there was the &ldquo;Pittsburgh Post&rdquo;<lb/>
and three &ldquo;Baltimore Sun's&rdquo; which Aunt<lb/>
Kate sent me. Of course I have not had<lb/>
time to read them all but I will<lb/>
try to read most of them to-morrow.</p>
<p>I am afraid you are spending a<lb/>
small fortune in postage and<lb/>
going to a great deal of trouble as well.<lb/>
Yesterday morning I got a card<lb/>
from Mrs. Hartman. In the evening<lb/>
I went to the address given and<lb/>
found that she had gone north, but<lb/>
would be back to-day. I will<lb/>
make another attempt to see her<lb/>
this evening.</p>
<p>I hope your cold continued to improve<lb/>
and that you have had no more<lb/>
trouble with it since. You must take<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00140002"/>
care of yourself. Although we have<lb/>
such bad weather here I have not<lb/>
had a sign of a cold. The weather<lb/>
is not at all changeable, it is<lb/>
always cold and always rainy.</p>
<p>My busy time is drawing to a close<lb/>
and I shall not be sorry for it<lb/>
as I have kept at work <del><unclear>A</unclear></del> very<lb/>
steadily ever since I got here.<lb/>
I will write to Uncle Tom in a<lb/>
few days. I have been intending to<lb/>
all along but I have not had<lb/>
the time and then I have seen<lb/>
very little of the town and country<lb/>
and I would have nothing to tell<lb/>
him.</p>
<p>I may not stay in London the full two<lb/>
weeks that I had intended, as I want<lb/>
to hurry to Germany to spend as<lb/>
much time as possible there. Still<lb/>
I cannot tell, I may stay two weeks<lb/>
and I may not, according to how<lb/>
I find it there. Direct letters to<lb/>
London for two weeks as I said<lb/>
and if I do not stay that long<lb/>
I will have them forwarded.<lb/>
You have never said anything about<lb/>
about what I should get for a<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00140003"/>
wedding present to Jess and Chrissie<lb/>
I wish you would suggest one<lb/>
or two things.</p>
<p>I have not been any place since<lb/>
I last wrote. I have added a<lb/>
new trip to the list of things I am<lb/>
going to do, It is a steamboat<lb/>
trip down to the mouth of the Forth<lb/>
around Bass Rock. The trip only<lb/>
costs a shilling. but it takes a<lb/>
whole afternoon and I have not<lb/>
any afternoons to spare until after<lb/>
Sir William Turners last examination<lb/>
which comes on next Tuesday.</p>
<p>I have not yet been to any of<lb/>
the churches here. But I can easily<lb/>
see all <del>I</del> that I want in one<lb/>
Sunday as they all hold five<lb/>
different services.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
