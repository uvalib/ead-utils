<salute>My own precious &ldquo;Widow&rdquo;:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here<lb/>
came a nice <hi>fat</hi> letter,<lb/>
yesterday, from my darl-<lb/>
ing girls and, also, a very<lb/>
<hi>thin</hi> one from poor, sweet<lb/>
&ldquo;oomsey&rdquo; dear- The first I<lb/>
enjoyed so much, for it<lb/>
told me that the sweet<lb/>
sufferer was &ldquo;feeling real<lb/>
well&rdquo;, but the other made<lb/>
me real unhappy with<lb/>
its news of another attack<lb/>
of that horrid trouble<lb/>
in my sweet farmer-lady's<lb/>
ankle -- still I had to laugh<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02233002"/>
at your darling expression<lb/>
about &ldquo;feeling like a <hi>widow</hi>&rdquo;-<lb/>
Well, well! what has got<lb/>
into your precious head<lb/>
my sweet &ldquo;oomsey&rdquo;? &ldquo;When<lb/>
are you coming back&rdquo;? &amp;c,<lb/>
you know that you didn't<lb/>
expect me to come back<lb/>
as soon as this, and just<lb/>
as our observations are<lb/>
proving so valuable, how<lb/>
could you even think<lb/>
of my returning and leav-<lb/>
ing affairs at their most<lb/>
important stage? Tut!<lb/>
Tut! lovie, dear, don't for-<lb/>
goodness sake, begin<del>s</del><lb/>
to talk that way! Of course<lb/>
I am just as anxious<lb/>
to come as can be, and I<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02233003"/>
am looking forward with<lb/>
perfect delight <add>to the time</add> when I can<lb/>
come, but it won't be<lb/>
before Christmas. Con-<lb/>
cerning your coming, noth-<lb/>
ing would delight me more<lb/>
than to have you come down.<lb/>
<hi>if</hi> I only had some place<lb/>
for you to get your <hi>meals</hi>.<lb/>
You couldn't mess with<lb/>
us, as things are, at present,<lb/>
for your precious nose<lb/>
would curl up over<lb/>
your forehead if you<lb/>
saw our outlay- Dr Bisp-<lb/>
ham leaves, next week,<lb/>
to bring back a baltimore<lb/>
girl, but I think that he<lb/>
will hardly have her join<lb/>
our bill of fare- I<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02233004"/>
C1<lb/>
B9<lb/>
could <add>make</add> you quite comfor-<lb/>
table, otherwise, and nothing<lb/>
would give me such pleas-<lb/>
ure as to have my precious<lb/>
wifie and daughter, too, to<lb/>
come- But little joy must<lb/>
not interrupt her studies.<lb/>
How could she get along<lb/>
without you? Who would<lb/>
help her in her studies?<lb/>
Who would look after<lb/>
her and stay with her? Please<lb/>
let me know all of these<lb/>
things when you next write,<lb/>
for I will see, if I can't ar-<lb/>
range to have us board<lb/>
with Dr Kean's Mess. Rest<lb/>
assured that I will do every<lb/>
thing to keep my sweet wifie<lb/>
from feeling &ldquo;like a <hi>widow</hi>&rdquo;!<lb/>
Consider every thing carefully<lb/>
and let me know in your<lb/>
next letter just what you<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02233005"/>
want to do and just what<lb/>
you think that you can<lb/>
do, remembering that<lb/>
precious pink joy daughter<lb/>
must be left in very safe<lb/>
hands. I <del>do</del> <add>know</add> that you would<lb/>
be delighted with the country<lb/>
when you once get here-<lb/>
Before I forget it, sweetheart,<lb/>
as I can't go into town and<lb/>
wouldn't know what to<lb/>
get even if I did <del>go</del> go,<lb/>
please take <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>20.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> &amp; get you<lb/>
some pretty Christmas pres-<lb/>
ent and <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>10.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> for something<lb/>
for our darling smart<lb/>
and sweet little daughter.<lb/>
Don't forget to do this-<lb/>
And <add>if</add> you could get Beech-<lb/>
ner something, too, I would<lb/>
be very glad. He is<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02233006"/>
such a reliable &amp; accommoda-<lb/>
ting old fellow, that I want<lb/>
to show him our apprecia-<lb/>
tion of him. Our patient,<lb/>
concerning whom I wrote<lb/>
you in my last, is doing<lb/>
very well- We had Dr John<lb/>
Guiteras, Dr Finlay &amp; Dr A<add>l</add>ber-<lb/>
tini here to see him, yester-<lb/>
day afternoon- They were<lb/>
all immensely interested<lb/>
and Dr Albertini did not hes-<lb/>
itate to say &ldquo;Yellow Fever &rdquo;-<lb/>
The others, too, regarded the<lb/>
case as one of probable<lb/>
yellow fever, but desired<lb/>
to see how his temperature<lb/>
&amp; pulse would run during<lb/>
the next two days. Dr Amador,<lb/>
an expert in yellow fever, says<lb/>
the disease is undoubtedly<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02233007"/>
yellow fever. Of course, I<lb/>
can't blame any one from<lb/>
witholding a diagnosis, until<lb/>
they are satisfied, but it is<lb/>
from my standpoint very<lb/>
amusing. The case is as<lb/>
<del>clear</del> <add>plain</add> as a nose on a man's<lb/>
face, but <del>has</del> Dr Guiteras<lb/>
has pronounced, in an<lb/>
interview, our theory as<lb/>
being &ldquo;very wild and im-<lb/>
probable&rdquo;, of course, he<lb/>
wants to be &ldquo;let down easy&rdquo;,<lb/>
for he sees already that<lb/>
he must surrender. He<lb/>
will come around in a<lb/>
few days- Dr Gorgas, also,<lb/>
saw the patient, and pronounces<lb/>
the case as so suspicious<lb/>
that had it occurred in<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02233008"/>
Havana, he would not<lb/>
have hesitated to send him<lb/>
to the yellow Fever Hospital-<lb/>
Ah! wonderful is nature,<lb/>
and I thank God that he<lb/>
has allowed poor, unwor-<lb/>
thy me to look a little way<lb/>
into this secret! Six months<lb/>
ago, when we landed on<lb/>
this Island, <hi>absolutely nothing</hi><lb/>
was known concerning the<lb/>
propagation &amp; spread of yel-<lb/>
low Fever -- it was all an<lb/>
unfathomable mystery --<lb/>
but, to-day, the curtain has<lb/>
been drawn -- its mode<lb/>
of propagation established --<lb/>
and we know that a case --<lb/>
<hi>minus mosquitoes</hi> -- is no<lb/>
more dangerous than one<lb/>
of chills &amp; fever! Hurrhah!<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02233009"/>
I will write to Dr Sternberg in a<lb/>
few days about the case -- of<lb/>
course, he will, at once, write<lb/>
an article &amp; say that for 20<lb/>
years he has considered<lb/>
the mosquito as the most<lb/>
probable cause of yellow<lb/>
fever- That would be just<lb/>
in order for him to do so-<lb/>
Dr Wasdin, of the marine<lb/>
Hospital Service, has written<lb/>
a very discourteous reply<lb/>
to our preliminary note, in<lb/>
the same Journal that our<lb/>
article appeared in- As<lb/>
soon as I can get time, I<lb/>
shall pay him my compli-<lb/>
ments in a style that he<lb/>
will never forget! Dr<lb/>
Cobb, of the same service,<lb/>
has, also, written a very<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02233010"/>
courteous and interesting<lb/>
answer to our paper, in<lb/>
which he proves, to his own<lb/>
satisfaction, that the mosqui<lb/>
-to can't possibly propagate<lb/>
the disease, &amp; says that it<lb/>
would be dreadful, after<lb/>
all the years of disinfection<lb/>
that his service has done,<lb/>
if this theory should be what<lb/>
we have claimed for it-<lb/>
And so the ball rolls on!<lb/>
Well, it is after ten o'clock<lb/>
&amp; I have written a long letter<lb/>
to my sweet &ldquo;oomsey&rdquo;- So, with a<lb/>
kiss &amp; a hug, I will say, &ldquo;good-night&rdquo;<lb/>
you sweet Miss Gouty! Boo! Boo!<lb/>
<hi><del>Saturday</del> <add>Wednesday</add> morning-12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>- Wake up! you<lb/>
precious, sweet girls and stop that ever-<lb/>
lasting snoozing! Your old Mr Papa<lb/>
is just preparing to take a cold shower-<lb/>
bath- Don't you wish that you <del>had</del><lb/>
both had one? What lazy, sleepy girls!<lb/>
nevertheless kisses &amp; love for my sweet children.</p>
