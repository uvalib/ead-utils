General A. E. Truby,<lb/>
145 Laurel Str.,<lb/>
San Francisco, Calif.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. (True):</salute>
</opener>
<p>I had a chance to finish my suggestions on your manuscript, and I<lb/>
am returning it to you by mail. In my opinion that is one of the nicest<lb/>
contributions to the yellow-fever history that I have ever seen, and I<lb/>
believe I have read most all that has been written on the subject. Your<lb/>
description is so clear-cut and so true to form that I do not see how it<lb/>
could be improved upon, and having been through the seige myself it was<lb/>
doubly interesting to me. I want to thank you for the kind words which<lb/>
you have said in it concerning myself.</p>
<p>I now want to congratulate you for being Grandpa for the first time.<lb/>
I have two sons, both doctors. The younger son Harvey, is in the Agnew<lb/>
State Hospital, Agnew, California, near San Jose. He is specializing in<lb/>
psychiatry. It is only 45 miles fron San Francisco and I hope that you<lb/>
may sometime find it convenient to drop in and see him. He is married<lb/>
and has four children, two boys and two girls and as nice a family as you<lb/>
will ever see any place. He is of a very pleasant disposition, was marrie[d]<lb/>
young only twenty years of age, and his wife a very charming lady and as<lb/>
nice a mother as it is anyone's good fortune to meet.</p>
<p>The older boy Sherman <add>Has two children Boy &amp; girl</add> is with the Massachusetts State Board of Health<lb/>
as an Industrial Hygienist. He secured this position after having taken a<lb/>
Public Health Course at Harvard. He is very much in love with his work and<lb/>
I think will make a success of it. He spent a year and a half at Walter<lb/>
Reed Hospital and I think while you were in Washington, and I did not know<lb/>
it at that time or I would have had him look you up. He was under Dr.<lb/>
Metcalfe who was in charge of the surgery at that time, and who by the wa[y]<lb/>
I was associated with in the P.I's. These are the only two children I ha[ve]<lb/>
and there is only seventeen months difference in their ages.</p>
<p>I hope to be in California some time this fall, and if I get out the[re]<lb/>
I assure you that I will look up my old pal. Thanking you very much for<lb/>
allowing me to read your manuscript and assuring you of the continuation<lb/>
of my good wishes in all your endeavors, I am as ever your friend,</p>
