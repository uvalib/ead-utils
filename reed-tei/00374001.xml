<p>True, the Army and Navy Medical and the Ma-<lb/>
rine Hospital services have accomplished much, but<lb/>
their view is necessarily restricted by their respec-<lb/>
tive fields.</p>
<p>The states cannot hope to deal with the question<lb/>
of public hygiene with that degree of exactness and<lb/>
comprehensiveness that it demands or that the<lb/>
general government could command. With its in-<lb/>
creasing importance, we might have anticipated an<lb/>
earlier recognition on the part of even a more con-<lb/>
servative government. So we say, hail to the man<lb/>
who promulgates health as the paramount issue,<lb/>
who will show the people that, while we may get<lb/>
along without wars and armies and navies, health<lb/>
is absolutely essential for the performance of the<lb/>
great purpose of life, whether it be one of action,<lb/>
ambition, fame, labor, or what not!</p>
<p>_____________</p>
<p>THE MOSQUITO AS A CARRIER OF YELLOW<lb/>
FEVER INFECTION.</p>
<p>Some really interesting work in connection with<lb/>
the etiology of yellow fever has recently been done<lb/>
by a board of medical officers of the United States<lb/>
Army, convened for the purpose of pursuing scien-<lb/>
tific investigations with reference to the acute in-<lb/>
fectious diseases prevalent on the Island of Cuba.<lb/>
This board, composed of Drs. Walter Reed, James<lb/>
Carroll, A. Agramonte and Jesse W. Lazear, give<lb/>
a preliminary report of their observations in the<lb/>
Philadelphia Medical Journal, Oct. 27. One of<lb/>
the members of the commission was stationed in<lb/>
Havana and one at Columbia Barracks. The epi-<lb/>
demic of yellow fever which was prevailing at<lb/>
Quemados, near their stations, furnished an admira-<lb/>
ble opportunity for clinical observations and for<lb/>
bacteriologic and pathologic work in this disease.</p>
<p>By far the most interesting observations made<lb/>
were those in connection with the experimental de-<lb/>
termination of the mosquito as being instrumental<lb/>
in the propagation of yellow fever. It is of<lb/>
great credit that two members of the commission<lb/>
and some others voluntarily subjected them-<lb/>
selves to yellow fever by permitting mosquitoes<lb/>
which had bitten patients suffering from yellow<lb/>
fever to inoculate them with the disease. As it<lb/>
was, both Dr. Carroll and Dr. Lazear contracted<lb/>
the disease in this experimental way, for the pur-<lb/>
pose of determining what influence the mosquito<lb/>
might have in the propagation of the disease.</p>
<p>In the case of the former the mosquito, which<lb/>
belongs to the species Culex fasciatus, had bitten a<lb/>
patient suffering with a severe case of yellow fever<lb/>
on the second day of the disease, twelve days be-<lb/>
fore; a mild case of yellow fever of the first day of<lb/>
the attack six days preceding; a severe case of yel-<lb/>

low fever of the second day of the attack, four days<lb/>
before, and a mild case of yellow fever on the sec-<lb/>
ond day of the attack two days before inoculation.<lb/>
The premonitory symptoms of the disease devel-<lb/>
oped on the fifth day, and the disease continued<lb/>
for nearly three weeks.</p>
<p>In the case of Dr. Lazear, he was bitten by a<lb/>
mosquito belonging to the same species, which ten<lb/>
days previously had been contaminated by biting a<lb/>
very mild case of yellow fever. No appreciable dis-<lb/>
turbances followed this inoculation. A month later,<lb/>
while the doctor was on a visit at the Las Animas<lb/>
Hospital, he was bitten by a Culex mosquito, the<lb/>
variety of which was undetermined. The symp-<lb/>
toms of yellow fever appeared five days later and<lb/>
the disease proved fatal a week later, twelve days<lb/>
after the bite.</p>
<p>The conclusions which the observers reached are<lb/>
as follows:<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. The blood taken during life from the general<lb/>
venous circulation on various days of the disease,<lb/>
in 18 cases of yellow fever, successively studied,<lb/>
has given negative results as regards the presence<lb/>
of bacillus icteroides.</item>
<item>2. Cultures taken from the blood and organs of<lb/>
11 yellow fever cadavers have also proved negative<lb/>
as regards the presence of this bacillus.</item>
<item>3. Bacillus icteroides (Sanarelli) stands in no<lb/>
causative relation to yellow fever, but when pres-<lb/>
ent should be considered as a secondary invader in<lb/>
this disease.</item>
</list></p>
<p>From the second part of their study of yellow<lb/>
fever they draw the following conclusions:</p>
<p>The mosquito serves as the intermediate host for<lb/>
the parasite of yellow fever and it is highly prob-<lb/>
able that the disease is only propagated through<lb/>
the bite of this insect.</p>
<p>All this is exceedingly interesting, in view of<lb/>
the recent reports that, notwithstanding the great<lb/>
improvement in the sanitary service and conditions<lb/>
which has followed the American occupation of<lb/>
Cuba, yellow fever still continues, apparently<lb/>
almost as severe and extensive as during the<lb/>
Spanish regime. We may therefore readily look<lb/>
for an increased interest in the study of the insect<lb/>
carriers of the disease, the corollary of which is<lb/>
necessarily the entire eradication of whatever dis-<lb/>
eases are transmitted in this way.</p>
<p>It is a source of unbounded regret, somewhat<lb/>
tempered by pride, that one of these observers<lb/>
should have come to his death in the interest of<lb/>
the experiment which he was undertaking. It is<lb/>
but one more evidence of the self-sacrificing spirit<lb/>
which characterizes the profession all over the<lb/>
world.</p>
