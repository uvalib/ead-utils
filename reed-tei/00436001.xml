Mrs Mabel Lazear<lb/>
Pasadena, Cal.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Mrs Lazear:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In your lines of February 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> you<lb/>
say that you &ldquo;telegraphed me today&rdquo;, did you?<lb/>
If so I never received a telegram from you,<lb/>
please inquire into this. I am surgeon of the<lb/>
Chicago Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad and I am<lb/>
connected with the depot and telegraph office by<lb/>
two telephone systems, so could not lose a<lb/>
message here.</p>
<p>In your last letter, received only last night,<lb/>
You give me some valuable information; but I<lb/>
still miss the letter D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Carroll wrote you immediate-<lb/>
ly after D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lazears death, if I remember rightly<lb/>
he wrote you at your request.</p>
<p>You say that you do not yet quite under-<lb/>
stand just what I want and what for.</p>
<p>I will try again.</p>
<p>A careful reading of what has<lb/>
been written about the Yellow fever Commission,<lb/>
as judged from a medical stand point, leaves the<lb/>
impression, and it has so affected the general<lb/>
public not only, but the medical profession as<lb/>
well, that the head of the Commission, was not<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00436002"/>
only the appointed head, but the head that con-<lb/>
ceived every move, every experiment and also<lb/>
the head, which succumbed at Cuba, just as<lb/>
your husband real ly did, and the only one, to<lb/>
the experiments there conducted, and as a neces-<lb/>
sary corrallery, the other members were only<lb/>
tools, admitted by good tools, <hi>but only that<lb/>
and nothing more</hi>. Now, if your husband and<lb/>
D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Reed had lived, nothing would be easier<lb/>
than the establishment of each ones share<lb/>
in the great work, and there is enough of it<lb/>
to go around; but both bring dead, and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
Carroll not bring permitted by the code<lb/>
of accepted morals to say one word, which<lb/>
would or could take away from the credit, al-<lb/>
ready bestowed upon D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walter Reed, nothing<lb/>
remains but <hi>antemortem statements and<lb/>
records</hi> to prove that D<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lazear and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
James Carroll did not only more then mecha-<lb/>
nical work, but really are the only ones of<lb/>
that commission, who suffered and died to<lb/>
prove that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carlos Finlays contention, that<lb/>
the <hi>mosquito is the conveyor of Yellow fever</hi>;<lb/>

No._______________<lb/>
and even this claim, absolutely true as far as<lb/>
D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Carlos Finlay is concerned, and he is living,<lb/>
is claimed for D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walter Reed in the United<lb/>
States by many physicians and by the public<lb/>
at large, though <hi>vehemently</hi> repudiated in<lb/>
Cuba, and rightly so. Even William S<lb/>
Thayer, who should have known better, says in one<lb/>
of the pamphlets, sent me by you in your last<lb/>
letter &ldquo;The investigations of the Commission led<lb/>
the members to the belief that a certain form<lb/>
of mosquito played an important part in<lb/>
the transmission of the poison of yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the facts are that your husband over his<lb/>
own signature says: that he received <hi>the eggs<lb/>
of the very mosquito</hi>, which is the cause of the<lb/>
conveyance of yellow fever to man, then known<lb/>
as &ldquo;Culex fasciatus&rdquo;, but afterwards named<lb/>
Stegomeya fasciata, <hi>from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Carlos Finlay<lb/>
himself</hi>, that he hatched those very eggs and<lb/>
used them in his experiments.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f00436004"/>
<p>I quote this so easily disproven misstatement, made<lb/>
by those near to the whole investigation, to show you<lb/>
how excusable the profession at large was and<lb/>
the general public more so, when D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed got<lb/>
all the credit and Lazear and Carroll <hi>none</hi>,<lb/>
except some <hi>pretty</hi>, <hi>pretty words</hi>, which are cheap<lb/>
commodities in the marts of the world, how-<lb/>
ever pleasant they made sound to interested<lb/>
ears. <del>at least</del></p>
<p>Now, as D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Howard A Kelly fears so dread-<lb/>
fully, I am not going to pull D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Walter Reed<lb/>
down from his monument by word or deed;<lb/>
but I am going to see to it, if I live, and<lb/>
I am grey haired now (61 years old) that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
Jesse William Lazear and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. James Carroll<lb/>
go unto that same monument with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
Walter Reed; and if Reeds widow can get<lb/>
125 dollars pension a month, <hi>when she does<lb/>
not need it</hi>, I am going to find out how<lb/>
much Carrolls and Lazears wife and<lb/>
widow and their children get under the<lb/>
rule of <hi>fair play</hi>, to which we Westerners<lb/>
subscribe, <hi>when they do need it</hi>.</p>

<p>No._______________</p>
<p>That is were my &ldquo;disinterestedness&rdquo; comes in.<lb/>
I am engaged as chairman of that committee<lb/>

come to your own, I am sure it will make<lb/>
me happy; but primarily I am fighting for<lb/>
the honor due the dead hero and the living<lb/>

And this fight is to be a clean one; so<lb/>
you need not fear to give me such data<lb/>
