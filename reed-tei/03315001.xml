<salute>Dear John Moran,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been on the point of writing you ever since<lb/>
the troubles in Havana. Did you and your family come through<lb/>
them all right and are you still all right? I hope sincerely<lb/>
that you are. I have a further piece of news for you. The<lb/>
play about which I talked to you in Havana will have its first<lb/>
performance before the public tonight. God knows what the public<lb/>
will say to it, but we shall find out tomorrow. I think I wrote<lb/>
you that I changed the names of the four soldiers in the play,<lb/>
though I am correcting that evil in the preface to the printed<lb/>
edition, a copy of which I will send you as soon as it is off<lb/>
the press. I did this partly out of consideration for you and<lb/>
Kissinger -- because I could not possibly know what you were<lb/>
like when you were kids and you might easily have resented any<lb/>
number of things that I should have had to write for you to say --<lb/>
and partly because Jernegan's widow, when she read in the papers<lb/>
that the play was to be produced, began raising hell with me in<lb/>
the mails. If you come to New York and if the play proves to be<lb/>
worth seeing (we always have to wait for the public to tell us<lb/>
that) call up Mr. Guthrie McClintic and tell him who you are or<lb/>
present this letter at the box office and he will provide you with<lb/>
seats. I should like to see your face when you see yourself under<lb/>
the name of O'Hara and six feet, four inches tall, but if you can,<lb/>
however, be reconciled to the lack of resemblance, you will enjoy<lb/>
the performance of a very fine young actor. God knows what they<lb/>
are going to do to us in the papers tomorrow. I have put in no<lb/>
love interest, no sugar coating and no trimmings. The play is<lb/>
about the experiment and nothing else and the chances are good<lb/>
that it will close in a week. It is, however, much the best thing<lb/>
I have written. I am going to Europe on Friday for a rest, as I<lb/>
have lately opened another play here and am very tired. Please<lb/>
give your wife my warmest greetings and let me hear from you when<lb/>
you have time.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Faithfully yours,</salute>
<signed><hi>Sidney Howard</hi></signed>.
