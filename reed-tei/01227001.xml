Dr. H.R. Carter,<lb/>
2122 California St. N.W.<lb/>
Washington,<lb/>
D.C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was much pleased to get your very kind letter<lb/>
July 30 with the information about early malaria in the U.S.<lb/>
I shall treasure this letter as a classic bit of history. And I was<lb/>
most sorry to hear of your attack of illness. I hope very soon to get<lb/>
better news.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was in Memphis and got to see Dr. Fricks,<lb/>
who has just returned from Europe. <unclear>S me</unclear> interesting information about<lb/>
conditions there. He is anxious for me to go to Italy somewhat<lb/>
before the time of the meeting so that I can get to look over<lb/>
some Paris green work Dr. Hackett is doing in the Campagna or near it.<lb/>
So, if accommodations can be arranged, I shall sail on the 26th of this<lb/>
month, some three weeks earlier than I had intended. Mrs. Barber will<lb/>
go with me. Possibly I will get over to the coast of Dalmatia, where<lb/>
they are doing some anti-malaria work. Then the meeting, possibly two or<lb/>
three weeks leave, and back in early November-a long stay but one which<lb/>
ought to be interesting. Since I will have to go so soon I may be unable to<lb/>
get together-and what may be of more importance get digested,<lb/>
my information on the diminution of malaria. But I have some<lb/>
new work, or hope to have, on larvicides, and Dr. Fricks thought<lb/>
the people would be more interested it that. I should myself prefer<lb/>
giving the larvicide paper, since I should like to get more information<lb/>
on the diminution of malaria problem before writing anything about it.<lb/>
Your letter, however, will be none the less valuable to me. With your<lb/>
permission, I may quote large parts of it./when I come to get all<lb/>
together.</p>
<p>Dr. Fricks had learned the details of the accident to Dr. Darling<lb/>
and his party. It seems that the car did not go over a cliff, just<lb/>
down a steep declivity <del>but</del> not enough to overturn it. But the people<lb/>
in the car were thrown out on the stones. Three were killed<lb/>
and two hurt comparatively little, Swellengrebel was in the car but not<lb/>
badly injured.</p>
<p>Dr. Hackett is now living in a Roman palace (or castle?)<lb/>
something magnificent, but comparatively inexpensive. I doubt if we will<lb/>
be there long enough to rent a castle, much as such an arrangement would<lb/>
please Mrs. Barber.</p>
<p>If I can get to stop in Washington I shall surely look you up.<lb/>
There may be a great hurry going-I hope less of one coming back.</p>
<p>I send my kindest regards to Miss Carter and I thank her very much<lb/>
for helping with the notes which you sent me.</p>
