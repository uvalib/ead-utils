Gen. A E Truby<lb/>
FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Andrus have I understand mentioned<lb/>
to you that I have tried to gain recog-<lb/>
nition as nurse for the yellow fever<lb/>
commission I have, and bills have<lb/>
passed the Senate twice but blocked<lb/>
in the House by objection from the<lb/>
War Dept. because others have tried to<lb/>
be placed on the list, <hi>Schwieger was<lb/>
an orderly <unclear>an</unclear> Maj. Carthwright and <unclear>Dr.<lb/>
Lezear</unclear> Cases,</hi> he was an immune, had<lb/>
yellow fever at <unclear>guanajay</unclear> he claim<lb/>
he ought to be on the list having helped<lb/>
taking care of Dr Lezear: When I disinfected<lb/>
all bedding from hospital and camp Lezear<lb/>
Morris helped (detailed to do so) he has tried<lb/>
to get <unclear>on</unclear> the list. Dr <unclear>Pinto</unclear> had a bill in<lb/>
congress trying for recognition for his &ldquo;heroic<lb/>
work risking his life in the yellow fever<lb/>
Hospital.&rdquo; (I have that <unclear>congressional</unclear> record) I<lb/>
wrote the Hon. Senator Lewis to please let<lb/>
me <unclear>tistify</unclear> against that bill when it was<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06001161"/>
2<lb/>
called, it was never put on the <unclear>callender</unclear><lb/>
I don't know if Mrs <unclear>Warner</unclear> has tried<lb/>
her luck, if she hasn't she has succeeded<lb/>
in another place (Please <add><unclear>see,</unclear></add> the clipping) as<lb/>
soon as I've read the clipping I wrote<lb/>
Mrs <unclear>Warner and</unclear> told her I did not think<lb/>
it fair for her to receive honors for<lb/>
work that I did, I asked her to deny in<lb/>
the same paper that she was the nurse,<lb/>
<unclear>althought</unclear> I inclosed self addressed stamped<lb/>
<unclear>envelop</unclear> she never answered, no doubt<lb/>
she thought I was dead, as well as all<lb/>
those connected with the experiment that<lb/>
knew the truth. In the book "Walter Reed<lb/>
and yellow fever on page 276 there is a<lb/>
few lines that every time I read it I get<lb/>
mad it says that in order to have success<lb/>
in the <unclear>treatmen</unclear> of yellow fever trained<lb/>
female nurses should be <del>y</del> used; amongst<lb/>
the five officers <unclear>Cartwright Patterson Edmunds<lb/>
Dr.</unclear> Lezear and Carroll who were sick with<lb/>
yellow fever, nursed by trained female<lb/>
immune nurses four of the five died I<lb/>
nursed over Sixty cases for Dr Ames at<lb/>
(Military Hosp. <unclear>no. 1</unclear>)<lb/>
<unclear>N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 1.</unclear> and at quemados, and only <unclear>one</unclear> died<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06001162"/>
3<lb/>
a sergeant from the battery the man<lb/>
had been a heavy drinker. I am not<lb/>
saying that I cured the patient no no, but<lb/>
whatever Dr Ames said to do, was done,<lb/>
nothing more and nothing less If Dr Ames<lb/>
had wanted the patients tapped over the<lb/>
head ever so often with a baseball batt<lb/>
it would have <add>been</add> done Only once did I<lb/>
see Camp Lezear Dr Ames took me with<lb/>
him in an ambulance but I was not<lb/>
allowed to step out, the <unclear>upprights of</unclear> the<lb/>
building was up and the Dr told me<lb/>
what it would be used for I then<lb/>
asked him to let me be the first<lb/>
one to sleep there and make <unclear>$100<hi rend="superscript">00</hi>.</unclear><lb/>
you have made extra money already he<lb/>
told me, besides I need you down<lb/>
below, I did make <unclear>$93<hi rend="superscript">00</hi></unclear> extra when I<lb/>
put up a disinfection plant for<lb/>
Maj. Gorgas at Las Animas and learned<lb/>
a man how to use it I later<lb/>
asked Maj. Reed to let me have a <unclear>bit &amp;</unclear><lb/>
of the <unclear>mosquitoes</unclear> but was told that<lb/>
Dr Ames needed me. Amongst the men<lb/>
who took part in the experiment there<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06001163"/>
4<lb/>
were four who took the dirty clothing<lb/>
test only, if yellow fever had been con-<lb/>
tagious I was more exposed to it<lb/>
then any one of the four, I handled not<lb/>
only the clothing but the patients, the<lb/>
excrement from the patients I helped<lb/>
Dr Agramonte with the autopsy an<lb/>
the sergeant who died when the officers<lb/>
got through in the morgue the left, I<lb/>
<unclear>served</unclear> up the corps cleaned it and<lb/>
when I was ready to put the body<lb/>
in the casked I went to the door<lb/>
and asked for help, the whole battery was<lb/>
lined up outside but there was not<lb/>
a man amongst his comrads who<lb/>
would come in and help me, So<lb/>
I had to partly roll and partly dump<lb/>
the corps in to the casket after <unclear>lid</unclear> was<lb/>
on I had to drag casket to door as<lb/>
they wouldn't even come inside the<lb/>
<unclear>Morgue.</unclear> During the experiment an old man<lb/>
by the name of Sullivan was picked up<lb/>
on the street in quemados. The <unclear>5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></unclear> day<lb/>
he had black vomit twice in the fore-<lb/>
noon I saved some of the vomit for<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06001164"/>
5<lb/>
Dr. Carroll to be used in the <unclear>labratory</unclear><lb/>
by order of Dr Ames, I'n the afternoon<lb/>
Maj. Gorgas came in with Dr ames<lb/>
and while they were talking Dr Ames<lb/>
called to <unclear>nu</unclear> get the pan! The pan being<lb/>
too far under the bed I had to get down<lb/>
on my knees to reach it, and while<lb/>
doing so Sullivan let go and <unclear>spewed</unclear><lb/>
black vomit over my head and neck<lb/>
Maj. Gorgas grabbed a towell and threw<lb/>
over my head and asked if I had any<lb/>
disinfectant I had a <unclear>tubb</unclear> full outside<lb/>
when they left I heard Sullivan ask<lb/>
the Major to come in and see him<lb/>
again, when they got outside Maj Gorgas<lb/>
said poor fellow, I won't have a chance<lb/>
to see him again. Three days later the<lb/>
Major called and asked why the death<lb/>
we had down there had not been<lb/>
reported I <hi>was answering the phone</hi><lb/>
and said there hasn't been any death<lb/>
here. Major asked what about old Sullivan<lb/>
I answered Sullivan isn't dead he is<lb/>
sitting up in bed today. I don't know<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06001165"/>
6<lb/>
where Maj. <unclear>Gorgas</unclear> phone from, but in<lb/>
less than 20 minutes he was down at<lb/>
the <unclear>hospitals</unclear> I heard him telling Sullivan<lb/>
that he was the first person he had seen<lb/>
who at his age. &ldquo;Sullivan was about 62 or 64&rdquo;<lb/>
recovered after having black vomit 3 times<lb/>
I think if yellow fever could have been<lb/>
contracted through <unclear>contagion</unclear> I was<lb/>
more exposed to it than the four who<lb/>
took dirty clothing test I guess that was<lb/>
why Maj. Reed every time he came down<lb/>
asked. how do you feel Lambert? In<lb/>
1930 I had a letter from the War Dept.<lb/>
saying that only to those essential to<lb/>
the commission would recognition<lb/>
be given, surely the commission had<lb/>
to have someone to care for the men<lb/>
after they got sick. In 1934 I had another<lb/>
letter from the War Dept stating that to<lb/>
the men who took part in the experiment<lb/>
a small sum of money was given<lb/>
and that my name was not on the<lb/>
list of those paid If Dr Ames could have<lb/>
foreseen that 30 years later those paid<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06001166"/>
7<lb/>
would be recognized as the only<lb/>
<unclear>onse</unclear> essential to the commission he<lb/>
would have chased <unclear>be</unclear> accross the rail<lb/>
road cut so that Maj. Reed could have<lb/>
asked me to volunteer to take care<lb/>
of the experimental cases as I had<lb/>
<unclear>previously</unclear> had volunteered to care<lb/>
for the natural cases I know <unclear>Maj</unclear> Reed<lb/>
would have given me the $100 without<lb/>
asking if he could have foreseen what<lb/>
would happen 30 years later. &ldquo;Please<lb/>
see Sen Thomas's report&rdquo; In 1937<lb/>
the Hon. Costella <add>of <unclear>Calif</unclear></add> voted against my Bill<lb/>
but on the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May 1940 when I had<lb/>
an opportunity to appear before the<lb/>
congressional Committee I proved<lb/>
even to him that I was the only nurse<lb/>
Senator Lewis of Illinois <unclear>pomissed</unclear> me<lb/>
before he died that if, or when I should<lb/>
come to Washington he would see<lb/>
that I would get an interview<lb/>
with the Surg Gen and be permited<lb/>
to prove my claim of having been<lb/>
the nurse for the yellow fever commission<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06001167"/>
AC<lb/>
In to L<lb/>
I could have done it easy (Sen. Lewis<lb/>
is now dead) and I lost my chance<lb/>
General I know I could convince<lb/>
you if I had only half a chance</p>
<p>Very respectfully yours<lb/>
Gust. E. Lambert<lb/>
P. S I am sorry it has taken me so<lb/>
long to answer but I'm blind on<lb/>
one eye and the good one is very poor<lb/>
after writing a <unclear>litte</unclear> I have to quit<lb/>
Lambert</p>
