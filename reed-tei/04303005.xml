Dr. Arthur C. Jacobson, Editor<lb/>
Medical Times<lb/>
67 Wall Street<lb/>
New York 5, New York<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Jacobson:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been in Europe for quite a while and have before me now your<lb/>
letter of October 9 requesting information regarding the early medical career<lb/>
of Walter Reed. I fear that by now you may have already written your article,<lb/>
but in the hope the following might still be helpful, I am sending it.</p>
<p>You might wish to consult the book &ldquo;Walter Reed: Doctor in Uniform&rdquo;<lb/>
by Laura N. Wood, (now Mrs. Crosby <unclear>Roper</unclear>, 2151 California Street, N. W., Washington,<lb/>
D. C.) published by Julian Messner, Inc., 1943. This gives some information<lb/>
about his early career but is not very specific about the dates and places and<lb/>
to the best of my knowledge, the following is as correct as can be found:<lb/>
<list type="simple">
<item>Fall, 1867 - Spring 1868: Attended University of Virginia, senior<lb/>
Latin and Greek classes but did not graduate in<lb/>
either branch.</item>
<item>October 1, 1868 - University of Virginia, began the study of medicine.</item>
<item>July 1, 1869 - Received the degree of M.D. from the University of Vir-<lb/>
ginia. I have Reed's medical diploma in my<lb/>
possession.</item>
<item>September 1869 - Matriculated as a student of medicine, Bellevue<lb/>
Hospital Medical College.</item>
<item>December 1869 - While attending medical lectures at Bellevue Hospital<lb/>
Medical College he took competitive examinations<lb/>
for the position of Assistant Physician, Infants'<lb/>
Hospital, Randall's Island, New York.</item>
<item><p>January 1, 1870 - April 1, 1871 - Assistant physician, Infants' Hospital<lb/>
Randall's Island.</p>
<p>In Reed's biographical notes of his early career, he twice calls this<lb/>
the Infants' Hospital. It must have officially been known as the Nursery Hospital<lb/>
because I have in my possession Reed's diploma from the Nursery Hospital stating<lb/>
that he had served there as assistant physician from January 1, 1870 to January 1,<lb/>
1871. I assume the term Infants' Hospital was a nickname. You will see that this<lb/>
information conflicts with that in your letter where you stated that he served at<lb/>
a hospital on Randall's Island which was a hospital for the feebleminded and<lb/>
crippled. Perhaps the Nursery Hospital was a unit of some larger state institution<lb/>
on Randall's Island. I do not know.</p></item>
<pb n="2" id="f04303006"/>
<item>Dr. Arthur C. Jacobson</item>
<item>- 2 -</item>
<item>February 18, 1949</item>
<item><p>April 1, 1871 (?) - August 1, 1871 - Assistant physician, Kings County<lb/>
Hospital, Flatbush, Long Island. My date of April 1<lb/>
is presumptive as Reed states that he held the position on Randall's Island<lb/>
&ldquo;until April 1, 1871, was then appointed assistant physician, Kings County<lb/>
Hospital and remained until August 1, 1871, at which time I resigned.&rdquo; Apparently<lb/>
Reed only interned at Kings County Hospital from April 1 to August 1; in other<lb/>
words, three months and then resigned.</p>
<p>There is an article &ldquo;Walter Reed at Kings County Hospital&rdquo; by B. J.<lb/>
Ficarra, Military Surgeon, Volume 92, pages 552 - 557, May 1943, which discusses<lb/>
in a vague way Reed's intership there. It does not state the time that he was<lb/>
at the hospital. Presumably the records did not show it as he was there for<lb/>
such a short time.</p></item>
<item>August 1, 1871 - August 1, 1872 - was resident physician and surgeon<lb/>
at Brooklyn City Hospital, Brooklyn, New York,<lb/>
from which he received two diplomas, both in my<lb/>
possession. One from the Board of Trustees and<lb/>
one from the &ldquo;Attending Physicians and Surgeons.&rdquo;</item>
<item>August 1, 1872 (?) - March 1, 1873 - District physician, Department<lb/>
of Public Charities of New York and Attending<lb/>
Physician, Eastern Dispensary, New York. The<lb/>
date of August 1, 1872 is presumptive. Reed says that he was resident surgeon<lb/>
of the Brooklyn City Hospital until August 1, 1872. &ldquo;At this time I was appointed<lb/>
district physician under the Department of Public Charities, New York and<lb/>
attending physician, Eastern Dispensary, New York, which positions (plural) I<lb/>
retained until March 1, 1873.&rdquo;</item>
<item>October 1, 1872 - received second degree of doctor of medicine from<lb/>
Bellevue Hospital. Obviously he was completing his lectures at the Bellevue<lb/>
Hospital while doing these various residencies, etc., and finally completed<lb/>
the requirements.</item>
<item>June 1873 - Appointed Sanitary Inspector, Brooklyn Board of Health.<lb/>
Apparently he continued this position until....</item>
<item>February 8, 1875 - He took his examination for the Army and entered<lb/>
the Army very shortly thereafter.</item>
