<salute>My dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have had it in my mind to write you ever since your visit to<lb/>
Washington in December. One of the greatest disappointments of my whole<lb/>
life was that I was unable to be present at your lecture at the Army Medical<lb/>
Center and to have a talk with you during your stay in Washington. Un-<lb/>
fortunately, I came down with one of these unknown virus infections in the<lb/>
upper respiratory tract about that time and was not able to be up and about<lb/>
for several days.</p>
<p>We regretted very much that it was impossible for you to attend<lb/>
the annual meeting of the Walter Reed Memorial Association. I sent you<lb/>
the Minutes soon thereafter but I have not heard from you, formally, con-<lb/>
cerning the matters brought up at the meeting. However, General Keane<lb/>
advises me that you did approve the modification of the inscription to be<lb/>
incorporated on the plaque to be placed at Fort Leslie McNair. If you<lb/>
feel that some wording other than that suggested by me, namely, &ldquo;Walter<lb/>
Reed died in a hospital on this site, November 23, 1902&rdquo;, I would be very<lb/>
glad to hear from you concerning any suggested changes.</p>
<p>I presume that you got in touch with General Bliss during<lb/>
your stay in Washington concerning the building in Havana, Cuba.</p>
<p>I note that a Bill has been introduced in Congress to memorial-<lb/>
ize Walter Reed on this, the 50th Anniversary of his work in Yellow Fever.<lb/>
Several people have made inquiry of me concerning the life and work of<lb/>
Walter Reed, and I have told them that, in my opinion, no one could give<lb/>
advice concerning that matter so well as could you.</p>
<p>Some time ago I wrote you a letter concerning the Reprints of<lb/>
your address when the Cornwall portrait was unveiled. You had sent some<lb/>
copies of this to General Keane and he was good enough to let me have two<lb/>
or three copies, which I deposited at Walter Reed Hospital. General Keane<lb/>
advised me that you had a large number of these Reprints, and the Command-<lb/>
ing Officer of Walter Reed General Hospital would like very much to get a<lb/>
sufficient number of copies for the members of his staff, and both General<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04325009"/>
Dr. Hench<lb/>
page 2<lb/>
Keane and I thought it would be highly desirable, if feasible, to give<lb/>
a sufficient number of copies to be distributed by the Surgeon General of<lb/>
the Army to all permanent hospitals, in order that the younger medical<lb/>
officers of the Army may have a better knowledge of the work of Walter<lb/>
Reed. If you can spare five or six hundred copies of this Reprint, it<lb/>
would be very greatly appreciated, and they should be sent to me at my<lb/>
home address:</p>
<p>2220- 20th Street, N.W.<lb/>
Washington, 9, D.C.</p>
<p>I have delayed making the contract for the plaque until the<lb/>
weather was a bit more settled and we could have it immediately placed<lb/>
on the site at Fort Leslie McNair. I am quite certain that it can be<lb/>
completed and installed in March.</p>
<p>With very best regards, and the hope we may see you some<lb/>
time in the next few months,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>J.F. Siler, Col., U.S.A. (Ret.)</signed>
