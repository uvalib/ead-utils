<p><hi>From Dr Kelly's collection</hi><lb/>
(1</p>
<p>I feel very grateful to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.<lb/>
Kelly for his kind invitation<lb/>
to attend this meeting tonight<lb/>
<del>and also</del> <add>and</add> with the purposes<lb/>
of which I sympathize<lb/>
most heartily.</p>
<p>I am doubly grateful also<lb/>
for the privelege of making<lb/>
a few remarks, expression of<lb/>
my own profound respect for<lb/>
the memory of my former<lb/>
colleague - the late D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carroll.</p>
<p>You may be gratified to<lb/>
learn that the Medical Faculty<lb/>
of the George Washington University<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02911003"/>
(2<lb/>
in which he was Prof. of Bacteriology,<lb/>
in Washington, some weeks ago,<lb/>
placed on record a suitable<lb/>
tribute of respect to the<lb/>
memory of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carroll; and<lb/>
the Medical Society of the D C<lb/>
at its first meeting after<lb/>
the summer holiday,<lb/>
appointed a Committee for<lb/>
the same purpose, which<lb/>
will shortly present its<lb/>
report.</p>
<p>It is well known to<lb/>
most of us that the<lb/>
medical and secular<lb/>
Press throughout the Country<lb/>
(and the world perhaps)<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02911004"/>
(3<lb/>
have expressed a most<lb/>
enthusiastic appreciation<lb/>
of the heroic career of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
Carroll in his humane<lb/>
endeavour to extend the<lb/>
boundaries of medical<lb/>
knowledge, in such a<lb/>
manner as to secure to the<lb/>
American people, immunity<lb/>
from the dreadful pestilence<lb/>
of yellow fever.</p>
<p>And still again: the eloquent<lb/>
words of the gentlemen who<lb/>
have preceded me, have, I<lb/>
think struck the chords<lb/>
of our hearts, as the fingers<lb/>
of a musician strike the<lb/>
strings of his instrument<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02911005"/>
(4<lb/>
and have elicited from<lb/>
the deepest recesses of our<lb/>
being, a responsive thrill<lb/>
of sympathy, respect<lb/>
and sorrow.</p>
<p>What more can I say?-</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you will allow<lb/>
me, I should like during the<lb/>
<unclear>few minutes</unclear> allotted me, to<lb/>
elaborate and emphasize<lb/>
one idea that has been<lb/>
already referred <add>to</add> by a previous<lb/>
speaker.</p>
<p>Has the American Government,<lb/>
and have the American people<lb/>
sufficiently realized the actual<lb/>
value (in dollars and cents if<lb/>
you will) of the demonstration<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02911006"/>
(5<lb/>
that yellow fever can be pre-<lb/>
-vented by protection from<lb/>
the bites of infected mosquitoes?-</p>
<p>And if this valuation has<lb/>
been fairly estimated, let me<lb/>
further ask, have the men<lb/>
who risked their lives to<lb/>
make <add>this</add> demonstration, been<lb/>
at all adequately rewarded?</p>
<p>Are republics ungrateful?-<lb/>
Certainly ours is not. Our<lb/>
pension roll, emphatically<lb/>
contradicts such a supposition.</p>
<p>A few years ago, one of<lb/>
our annual pension appropriations<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02911007"/>
(6<lb/>
was <hi>more than double</hi><lb/>
the annual expenditure for<lb/>
pensions, of four <unclear>European</unclear><lb/>
governments combined, viz:<lb/>
France, Germany, Great Britain<lb/>
and Austria -Hungary.</p>
<p>Our own government has<lb/>
not only been lavishly generous<lb/>
in its distribution of pensions,<lb/>
but it has been (we must<lb/>
confess) <del>carelessly profligate.</del><lb/>
<add>prodigally extravagant.</add></p>
<p>It is tacitly admitted<lb/>
that more men are today<lb/>
receiving pensions for<lb/>
gallantry during our recent<lb/>
spanish war, than were<lb/>
ever enrolled in Shafter's<lb/>
Army.</p>
<pb n="8" id="f02911008"/>
<p>(7</p>
<p>Now if it be true that &ldquo;the<lb/>
very walls have ears&rdquo;, I<lb/>
think the white marble blocks<lb/>
of the Capitol at washington<lb/>
should blush to witness<lb/>
the annual distribution of<lb/>
millions of money to satisfy<lb/>
the hungry demands of<lb/>
<del>fraudulent</del><add>undeserving</add> pensioners,<lb/>
fradulent contractors; land<lb/>
frauds, post office graft;<lb/>
and a hundred others,<lb/>
while the widows and<lb/>
children of our sleeping<lb/>
medical heros, who risked<lb/>
their lives to secure to the<lb/>
American people immunity<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02911009"/>
(8<lb/>
from pestilence &amp; plague,<lb/>
remain without adequate<lb/>
means of support appropriate<lb/>
for the station of life in<lb/>
which God has placed<lb/>
them</p>
<p>About 1/3d of a century<lb/>
ago, and therefore still fresh<lb/>
in the memory of some of<lb/>
we older physicians, occurred<lb/>
those dreadful epidemics<lb/>
of yellow fever, which<lb/>
almost depopulated the cities<lb/>
of Shreveport, La., &amp; Memphis<lb/>
Tenn.</p>
<pb n="10" id="f02911010"/>
<p>(9</p>
<p>Today we feel perfectly<lb/>
confident that the curtain<lb/>
has fallen for the last<lb/>
time upon those dismal<lb/>
dramas. We remain<lb/>
serenely secure in the assurance<lb/>
that the beams of the<lb/>
rising sun will never<lb/>
recall such tragedies<lb/>
again.</p>
<p>Now if it had been<lb/>
possible during the prevalence<lb/>
of those epidemics, to<lb/>
purchase the means of<lb/>
immunity from future<lb/>
similar invasions, at<lb/>
what figure do you think<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f02911011"/>
(10<lb/>
the survivors of their<lb/>
dead, <add>would</add> have estimated the<lb/>
value of such a secure<lb/>
immunity? Not by hundreds<lb/>
or thousands of dollars,<lb/>
but surely by millions!</p>
<p>I firmly believe, if the<lb/>
Government of the United States<lb/>
should take from its Treasury<lb/>
a solid hundred thousand<lb/>
dollars and present it to the<lb/>
widow of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Jas. Carroll -<lb/>
a similar sum to the<lb/>
widow of Walter Reed -<lb/>
and perhaps still another to<lb/>
your own distinguished dead<lb/>
D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jesse W. Lazear; I believe<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f02911012"/>
(11<lb/>
it would be doing an<lb/>
act that <add>the</add> whole American<lb/>
people would commend,<lb/>
and the entire world<lb/>
applaud.</p>
<p>It has been said that<lb/>
Medical officers of the Army<lb/>
working on the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Commission, were acting under<lb/>
orders from the War Dept.,<lb/>
as soldiers are ordered to<lb/>
fall in line for battle.</p>
<p>But no authority in<lb/>
the Government can order<lb/>
a soldier to inoculate<lb/>
his own body with a<lb/>
<pb n="13" id="f02911013"/>
(12<lb/>
dangerous <add>infection,</add> even <add>though</add> it were<lb/>
for the benefit of a<lb/>
suffering world.</p>
<p>If D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carroll were<lb/>
acting under orders, it<lb/>
must have been in obedience<lb/>
to the Command: &ldquo;Thou shall<lb/>
love thy neighbor as Myself<lb/>
and do to others as you<lb/>
would they should do<lb/>
unto you&rdquo;- a mandate that<lb/>
does not have the ring of an<lb/>
order issued by a Department<lb/>
of War.</p>
<pb n="14" id="f02911014"/>
<p>(13</p>
<p>We have tonight, figuratively<lb/>
speaking, strewn over the<lb/>
grave of the lamented<lb/>
Carroll, a few last roses<lb/>
of summer, and we have<lb/>
watered them with tears of<lb/>
sympathy for his family;<lb/>
but of what avail are<lb/>
these flowers and tears and<lb/>
expressions of sympathy, in<lb/>
providing the means of life<lb/>
- food, raiment, shelter,<lb/>
education and recreation-<lb/>
for his bereaved family?-</p>
<p><del><unclear></unclear><lb/>
<unclear></unclear><lb/>
<unclear></unclear></del></p>
<pb n="15" id="f02911015"/>
<p>(14</p>
<p>If it were possible for<lb/>
material things and easy<lb/>
conditions of life, to &ldquo;pluck<lb/>
from the memory a rooted<lb/>
sorrow&rdquo;, I wish we could<lb/>
hasten the day when the<lb/>
sorrows of the survivors of<lb/>
the man we honor tonight<lb/>
might <add>partially at least</add>, be turned into joy,<lb/>
just as &ldquo;drops of water rolling<lb/>
down the check of anguish<lb/>
reappear in the rainbow&rdquo;-<lb/>
(Draper) that beautiful<lb/>
emblem of hope.</p>
