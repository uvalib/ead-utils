<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>

<p>A little while ago I wrote to you concerning the mysterious dis-<lb/>
appearance of the letter which you wrote to me on September 20. The<lb/>
mystery has now been solved for the letter is back again on my desk hav-<lb/>
ing been returned to me by Miss Helen Bayne, our librarian. I now remem-<lb/>
ber, of course, that when the letter came from you I sent it up to Miss Bayne<lb/>
for her comment regarding some of the questions which you asked.</p>
<p>Miss Bayne agrees with me that it would be very fine, indeed, if we<lb/>
could have a photograph of Dr. Reed's diploma. She also provides the follow-<lb/>
ing answers to your questions which I quote directly from her letter to me.</p>
<p>She refers me to the following book &ldquo;Walter Reed and Yellow Fever&rdquo;<lb/>
by Howard A. Kelly, page 9....&ldquo;After finishing his course at Bellevue, Dr.<lb/>
Reed was attached to several of the hospitals in New York and Brooklyn,<lb/>
amongst these the King's County Hospital, where he was interne. He was also<lb/>
at the hospital on Randall's Island, where he went especially to study child-<lb/>
ren's diseases. A little later he was appointed district physician to one<lb/>
of the poorest districts in New York, and was thus brought into daily con-<lb/>
tact, for the first time, with all the misery arising from poverty and vice<lb/>
in a large city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the book &ldquo;Walter Reed Doctor in Uniform&rdquo; by L.N. Wood, pages<lb/>
74-75, Miss Bayne gives the following quotation: &ldquo;he had taken his Bellevue<lb/>
medical degree in 1872, and from that time on his services had been, for the<lb/>
most part, devoted to the very poor who lived in the tenements that huddled<lb/>
in side streets toward the rivers and downtown in the older parts of the city.&rdquo;<lb/>
On page 76...&ldquo;The young doctor, while interning at the King's County Hospital<lb/>
.....was appointed a Health Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I said at the beginning, we do not have a photograph of Reed's<lb/>
diploma and we will have one more cause to be grateful to you if you will<lb/>
have one made for us. I feel very foolish that I <add><unclear>have</unclear></add> forgotten what I had done<lb/>
with your letter. It just shows how thoroughly I qualify for the role of<lb/>
&ldquo;absent minded professor&rdquo;.</p>
