FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
<dateline>
<date value="1943-09-10">Sept 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> - 43</date>
8009 Avalon<lb/>

Gen. Albert. E. Truby<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir</salute>
</opener>
<p>It has taken me a long time<lb/>
to state my oppinion on the book<lb/>
but I have been on the shelve and<lb/>
couldn't write, now I'm alright<lb/>
again I've made aquintance with<lb/>
my 2 first patients in cuba the<lb/>
young man from La Punty and<lb/>
Col. O'Reilly. I was working in the<lb/>
palace when Dr. Ames told me one<lb/>
day to go home and <unclear>prepare</unclear> a bed<lb/>
in the yellow fever dept. a young<lb/>
man was sent there, I understand he<lb/>
was a clerk in Gen. Brooks office<lb/>
Dr Wells lost his commission on<lb/>
account of that patient on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> day<lb/>
Dr Ames had to report at pyrotecnia<lb/>
Dr Wells took his place and was told<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06401169"/>
by Maj. Carter to stay in with the<lb/>
patient, he came and looked in<lb/>
the door and left, while not walking<lb/>
around he met Maj. Carter, the Major<lb/>
asked him (or told him) that his orders<lb/>
were to stay with the patient Dr Wells<lb/>
said he couldn't obey such orders as he<lb/>
had to have fresh air Maj. Carter then told<lb/>
him that if he couldn't obey orders he did<lb/>
not belong in the army Dr Wells disappeared<lb/>
from N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 1 Dr Parrett took his place Dr<lb/>
Parrett took a picture of the patient himself<lb/>
and me I had hold of that picture only<lb/>
a short time ago but can't find it <unclear>now</unclear><lb/>
it was <unclear>unmounted</unclear> and might be hid in<lb/>
some book, there was only one bed in<lb/>
the ward and the first three days and<lb/>
nights I never closed my eyes the 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi><lb/>
night I was afraid to sit down<lb/>
because I knew I would have fallen<lb/>
asleep, at 2 A.M. Dr Ames found me<lb/>
standing up against the door jam dead<lb/>
asleep, he laid me down on the floor<lb/>
and put a spare blanket under my head<lb/>
and let me sleep to 7 A.M. I was<lb/>
scared stiff when I woke up and saw<lb/>
the Doctor sitting longside the bed, but he<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06401170"/>
told me it was alright he knew I<lb/>
was tired out, from there on I was<lb/>
Dr Ames's man <unclear>friday</unclear> because I felt that<lb/>
if it had been some of the other<lb/>
Doctors they might have had me carted<lb/>
over to the gaurdhouse, on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> day<lb/>
Dr Ames got a civilian a man from<lb/>
New Orleans immune to come in<lb/>
and help, but he was left alone next<lb/>
day as I was sent over to Pyrotecnia<lb/>
to take care of Col. O.Reilly who had his<lb/>
quarters there but he did not have yellow<lb/>
fever I understand Mrs Ames the<lb/>
&ldquo;widow&rdquo; have a letter of thanks that<lb/>
Col. O Reilly sent Dr Ames after he<lb/>
got well, I was a little surprised that<lb/>
it wasn't mentioned that Dr Ames<lb/>
himself had yellow fever Maj. Stark<lb/>
treated him and must have signed<lb/>
his release from the hosp. I have Dr Ames's<lb/>
service record from the Adj. Gen. Office<lb/>
and it states that Dr. Ames had yellow<lb/>
fever I'm a little dissapointed that the<lb/>
book did not show Miss Lewis affidavit, that<lb/>
Dr. Ames was carried during his own illness<lb/>
down to the pest house to attend to Andrus<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06401171"/>
when Dr. Pinto was negligent in taking<lb/>
care of him I got an <unclear>awfull</unclear> calling<lb/>
down from Maj. Stark for taking Dr Ames<lb/>
did and all down there, but his anger<lb/>
was only temporary Maj. stark was very<lb/>
kind to me later I was the last person<lb/>
he operated on in quemados, he did<lb/>
that after he was retained. I see that the<lb/>
blue print map you sent me for inspec.<lb/>
tion was used, of course no one knows<lb/>
the difference but I lived down there<lb/>
for over Six months and Dr Pinto was<lb/>
not down there more than 6 or 8 times<lb/>
(if that many) I still <unclear>remembert</unclear> the<lb/>
old shacks well enough to point<lb/>
out the leeks in the roof if they were<lb/>
still standing. Book is good and as soon<lb/>
as sold in chicago I will send one to<lb/>
Miss Lewis who is living in Pasadena<lb/>
and one to the Headquarters of the ladies<lb/>
of the appalachian to show that they bestowed<lb/>
their <hi>first Lady Honor</hi> on Mrs Warner for<lb/>
work that <hi>I did</hi> and <hi>not she</hi> again I<lb/>
thank you for the book</p>
