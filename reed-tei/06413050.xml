General Jefferson R. Kean<lb/>
2804 N Street, N. W.<lb/>
Georgetown<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Generals Kean and Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I thought you would like to see a copy of a letter I have just<lb/>
sent to Mr. Moran. I did not know that he was writing his memoirs. He sent<lb/>
me a little note that de Kruif had sent him saying that, if his memoirs were<lb/>
any good, they would find a publisher. In a day or two he wrote me that at<lb/>
last the Cuban Government seemed interested in our shack. Things began to<lb/>
happen fast and within a couple of days various officials asked him to show<lb/>
them our shack. He had his photograph taken with these officials at<lb/>
Camp Lazear and it was decided that the Government would make the shack a<lb/>
National monument. A day or two later officials of the Cuban Medical College<lb/>
came to him, not having heard of the governmental action, and wanted to do<lb/>
something about the shack. They were greatly chagrined when the next day's<lb/>
paper announced they had taken over the project. Meanwhile I have heard<lb/>
from one of these officials, answering the letter I sent to his predecessor<lb/>
two and one-half years ago and which his predecessor never answered. So far<lb/>
as I can see the Cuban Government has not yet made any financial plans to<lb/>
back up their action and they are inviting me now to participate in their<lb/>
plans--which I shall be glad to do. Not surprisingly, the heading of the<lb/>
newspaper photograph of the shack with Moran and the officials standing in<lb/>
front read something as follows: &ldquo;Shack Where Finlay Did His Work to Prove<lb/>
the Cause of Yellow Fever Becomes National Monument.&rdquo; The article therewith<lb/>
was also considerably joggled and stated that the Mayo Clinic had already<lb/>
given $10,000. I made it clear in 1944 when I wrote the officials (which<lb/>
letter they never answered) that the Mayo Foundation had promised me up to<lb/>
$10,000 contingent on the gifts of others and on the interest of the Cuban<lb/>
Government. In any event, things seem to be moving.</p>
<p>I leave tomorrow to speak at the Meeting of the American College<lb/>
of Physicians and then to give several lectures at the Army and Navy<lb/>
General Hospital, Hot Springs, Arkansas. I have been made &ldquo;Expert Civilian<lb/>
Consultant to the Surgeon General&rdquo; and will visit various army hospitals<lb/>
from time to time.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
