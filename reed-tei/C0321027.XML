<salute>Dear Jack:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In reply to your letter of October 22<add><hi rend="superscript">nd</hi></add> I would state</p>
<p>(1): That you are correct in your understanding <hi>re</hi> Bacot's<lb/>
report viability of aegypti eggs after 8 months not being under pre-<lb/>
cisely same circumstances as stated in our MS (i, <add>p. 12)</add>.<lb/>
Miss Brown and I rewrote the Bacot cards, which are all taken <del>form</del><lb/>
from the Fourth and Final Report of the British West African Com-<lb/>
mission<del>.</del> <add>for which you have library card.</add> This <add>report</add> contains the &ldquo;Summary of Conclusions&rdquo; of the Third<lb/>
Investigators report, containing results of Bacot's work on life<lb/>
history &ldquo;Stegomyia fasciata&rdquo; from 1914 to 1916 (?) The Library of<lb/>
the S. G. does not possess this Third Report, never received it. I <add>know this<lb/>
from having</add> found correspondance between Father and Noble (when he was Librarian)<lb/>
on the subject. We have then<add>,</add> copied from the Fourth and final re-<lb/>
port<add>:</add> both the references <hi>re</hi> (i. p. 10) effect of soap on aegypti<lb/>
larvae and (i. p. 12 (a and b) <unclear><add>(our bib. card)</add></unclear>) ) <hi>re</hi> viability aegypti eggs<add>:</add> <del>with:</del>(<hi>b</hi>)<lb/>
account of the way in which they fi<del>an</del><add>na</add>lly reached Malcolm MacGregor.<lb/>
We also made out a card for MacGregor (1915) giving his own account<lb/>
of how the eggs came into his hands <add>(from sir James Fowler)</add></p>
<p>Of course, we should have <hi>much</hi> preferred seing Bacot's origi-<lb/>
nal report in vol. iii. Father did see it. He states this in his<lb/>
correspondance with Gen. Noble. However, the S. G's Library can<lb/>
give us no suggestions as to <add>how to</add> get a copy. Miss Brown, however, says<lb/>
that the 1st. 2nd. and 4th. and final reports were presented to <del>h</del>the<lb/>
S. G's Library by the Prudential Insurance Co. of America,<lb/>
Newark, N. J.<lb/>
and suggests that we might write them and see if they could tell us<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0321028"/>
us<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
where we could see a copy, or that possibly they might lend us one<lb/>
themselves. Do you think it is worth while? And, if so, wouldn't<lb/>
they be more apt to lend it to you than to us? I'm not trying to<lb/>
shirk writing letters <add>(</add>much as I hate 'em!<add>)</add> its just that one wants<lb/>
to be sure of getting what one goes after.</p>
<p>For the latter part of your paragraph <hi>re</hi> vol. iii <add>Investigators reports.</add> I don't think<lb/>
its a different class of publication from the other reports as J. and <add>vols.</add><lb/>
A. Churchill of London also published <add>the paper backed copies of</add> the Fourth and Final Report and<lb/>
i and ii. These (i and ii) are also published in the Y. F. Bureau<lb/>
Bulletins. I am enclosing data on the missing Investigators Report (v. iii)</p>
<p>2): Would it be asking too much if, in the future, when you re-<lb/>
turn bibliographic cards for further information, you have Miss Fred-<lb/>
erick enclose <add>or send a copy of</add> the library card also; or else copy all data on library<lb/>
card on the bibliographic card? It would save us a <hi>lot</hi> of time in<lb/>
looking things up, <del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> You see, on account of the time<lb/>
element involved, we only put enough data on our bibliographic cards<lb/>
to identify them with the library cards, and without the latter we<lb/>
have to duplicate a good deal of our work</p>
<p>3): I am enclosing library and bibliographic card for Father's<lb/>
article read in Australia (1923). Haven't given<del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> pagination <add>(Father's MS)</add> on bib-<lb/>
liographic card as I assume you have it, and I would have to go through<lb/>
the MS to find it. If you haven't it, of course, I'll be glad to get<lb/>
it for you, but I assume you have a bibliographic card with the pagina-<lb/>
tion.</p>
<p>4): By the way, this is dealing in &ldquo;futures,&rdquo; but before the<lb/>
bibliography <del>(library cards)</del> is typed, may Miss Brown and I please go<lb/>
over <add>the library cards</add> with you? We are extremely anxious to do this both in<lb/>
order to learn your wishes concerning certain of the cards and also to<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fC0321029"/>
to<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
rewrite any that may not conform to a uniform order of proceedure.<lb/>
Please don't think I'm getting &ldquo;set&rdquo; in my ways from my very small ex-<lb/>
perience of working in libraries, and with librarians, but I'm sure<lb/>
you agree with me that the &ldquo;manner&rdquo; as well as the &ldquo;matter&rdquo; counts, al-<lb/>
though &ldquo;differing in degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5): I am enclosing a note from Morley, in answer to my inquiry<lb/>
<hi>re</hi> filling in our outline maps etc. Not very satisfactory, but better<lb/>
than I had hoped, if he even gets someone else interested in part of the<lb/>
work. No data on the bibliographic refs. I asked him for. However, we<lb/>
got the one on the Book of the Jew ourselves.</p>
<p>6): No news from L. O. Howard's librarian <hi>re</hi> the references she<lb/>
asked me to turn over to her</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to ask us to do anything in the world we can for<lb/>
you. You've got the really hard part of the work and even the smallest<lb/>
thing we can do to make it easier will be a privelege.</p>
<p>With much love to the Susans,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>
