<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You have certainly done a swell job in<lb/>
analyzing the whole situation in regard to the medical<lb/>
possibilities for Founders' Day. I am delighted to<lb/>
have this authoritative study on your part and I<lb/>
cannot tell you how much I appreciate it. I am<lb/>
very definitely convinced that your suggestion of<lb/>
Doctor Sawyer is the right one for the main speaker<lb/>
on the morning of Founders' Day. I am going to<lb/>
propose this to the trustees at the next meeting and<lb/>
see if we can sign him up. I find in my experience<lb/>
that it is better to finish one part of it at a time,<lb/>
and if we can get him then we can go on to the<lb/>
question of the evening dinner which is a different<lb/>
problem.</p>
<p>If we have Doctor <add>W A</add> Sawyer <add><del><unclear></unclear></del> Director Int Health <del><unclear>Ara</unclear></del><add><unclear>Div</unclear></add> Rockefeller <unclear>Fo</unclear></add> in the speech of the<lb/>
morning dealing with this yellow fever incident, and<lb/>
if we have the play the night before and the background<lb/>
talk by yourself, it is entirely probable that we will<lb/>
need to move to some other phase of medicine for the<lb/>
dinner. This outline which we have now will constitute<lb/>
enough treatment of the Lazear problem and the plan<lb/>
will be to have something quite different for that dinner<lb/>
Founders' Day evening, though it should be along medical<lb/>
lines. It may be that something may be worked out in<lb/>
the reapproachment of Washington and Jefferson College<lb/>
and Jefferson Medical School. As you know, there is a<lb/>
very involved relationship due to these portraits which<lb/>
were stolen and ultimately given to Jefferson Medical<lb/>
School. It may be that the <hi>new Dean of that School is</hi><lb/>
a good speaker, that we can persuade them to return<lb/>
these famous portraits to this College on that occasion<lb/>
and that we can thus make that dinner one dealing<lb/>
primarily with medical education. This is just an idea<lb/>
that is playing through my mind and I pass it on to you.</p>
<p><unclear>Polit.<lb/>

<p>Henry K<lb/>
<hi><unclear>Mohler</unclear></hi></p>
<p>If you happen by chance to have any reactions<lb/>
concerning the speaking ability of the new Dean of the<lb/>
Jefferson Medical let me have them. Of course I can<lb/>
pick this up in Philadelphia, so do not go out of your<lb/>
way in the matter.</p>

<p>Doctor Philip S. Hench</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>December 18, 1939</p>
<p>Since I wrote you, the students have put<lb/>
on &ldquo;Yellow Jack&rdquo; and it was very successfully and<lb/>
effectively done. This means that we are sure of being<lb/>
able to put it on next year with success. We are<lb/>
profoundly disappointed that Sidney Howard himself<lb/>
was killed this summer.</p>
<p>Thank you for increasing your pledge to one<lb/>
hundred and fifty and please bear in mind that you can<lb/>
take three years to pay this, doing it when and as it<lb/>
is convenient. The requirement that it carry &ldquo;Lafayette<lb/>
'16&rdquo; may have been intended as a joke, but I have<lb/>
suggested to the men here that it would be a very<lb/>
effective thing to put on there in view of the large<lb/>
number of names carrying W. and J. numerals. I am<lb/>
hoping they will do it and think they will.</p>
<p>I still do not know when I can get out there,<lb/>
but I hope it will be quite soon. It depends a little<lb/>
bit on how Harriet's health is and how campaign<lb/>
measures go forward in other respects.</p>
<p>I hope that you folks have a lovely<lb/>
Christmas and that there will be much happiness in your<lb/>
home. With kindest regards,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
