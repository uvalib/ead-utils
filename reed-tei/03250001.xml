<p>"In the spring of 1901, following a year of much activity in working, writing, and<lb/>
lecturing on the subject, I prepared the volume entitled &ldquo;Mosquitoes: How They Live;<lb/>
How They Carry Disease; How They Are Classified; How They May Be Destroyed.&rdquo; The<lb/>
volume was promptly published by McClure, Phillips &amp; Co. of New York, and was widely<lb/>
read. Surgeon General Sternberg had a large number of copies bought for the use of<lb/>
the Army surgeons, and there seems no doubt that it was published at a psychological<lb/>
moment. Just before this book was published the Century Magazine published an article<lb/>
of mine entitled &ldquo;Malaria and Certain Mosquitoes&rdquo; (April 1901).</p>
<p>There was one rather unfortunate episode connected with the publication of the<lb/>
book. It had not been out two days before I was told by a friend that Dr. Walter<lb/>
Reed's friends felt hurt by the way I had told the yellow-fever story. I had often<lb/>
talked with General Sternberg during the progress of the work of the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Commission in Habana. In fact, we met almost daily at the Cosmos Club, and he told me<lb/>
of his latest news from Reed or I told him of some letter that I had received from him.<lb/>
I thought that I was familiar with the situation, and stated in the book that the<lb/>
Commission had been appointed by General Sternberg and instructed by him to investigate<lb/>
the disease from the mosquito standpoint.</p>
<p>It seems that this was not the case. Their instructions were general and not specific.<lb/>
The mosquito investigation was undertaken on Reed's sole initiative. As a matter of fact,<lb/>
before going to Cuba for their work, Reed and Lazear spent some time in my office studying<lb/>
mosquitoes in order that they might more easily identify the old &ldquo;Culex fasciatus&rdquo; with<lb/>
which Carlos Finlay of Habana had done his earlier work; and during their investigations<lb/>
Reed frequently wrote me and sent me mosquitoes for examination.</p>
<p>When I learned that my phraseology had been criticized, I at once called on Reed and<lb/>
found him in an office in the Army Medical Museum. He was rather solemn, though perfectly<lb/>
courteous and friendly, and when I had made my explanation he said &ldquo;That is how I thought<lb/>
it happened, but as a matter fo fact I went into this line of work without instructions.&rdquo;<lb/>
And he went on to tell me that he had been doing some work at Johns Hopkins University<lb/>
and had often talked with W. S. Thayer who had visited Italy and studied the Anopheles-<lb/>
malaria work there and had therefore become anxious to do experimental work with yellow<lb/>
fever and mosquitoes.</p>
<p>I did the best I could under the circumstances, and wrote an article which was pub-<lb/>
lished in the American monthly Review of Reviews for August, 1901, and which was entitled<lb/>
&ldquo;Mosquitoes as Transmitters of Disease&rdquo;. In this article I omitted all reference to<lb/>
instructions from the Surgeon General's Office and gave to Major Reed the whole credit<lb/>
for the inauguration of the work. I followed this with another article &ldquo;Yellow Fever<lb/>
and Mosquitoes&rdquo;, in the Century Magazine for October, 1903."-----p. <hi>469-470</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;Years later I became well acquainted with Walter Reed, James Carroll, and Jesse W.<lb/>
<del><unclear>Lazear</unclear></del> Lazear. They came to the entomological offices in the Department of Agriculture<lb/>
to study mosquitoes before they went to Cuba where their immortal work discoveries were<lb/>
made. During the progress of the Cuban work Walter Reed wrote me frequently for information<lb/>
about mosquito questions&rdquo;----p. <hi>481</hi></p>
<p>(I think that Dr. Howard is certainly in error here when he says that <del>Reed and</del> Lazear<lb/>
visited him before they went to Cuba. Lazear went to Cuba in February 1900 and already knew<lb/>
a lot about mosquitoes. Reed and Carroll may well have visited Howard (p. 481) See my<lb/>
photostat copies of the Howard-Reed-Carroll correspondence. Reed and Carroll were in<lb/>
Washington in May 1900 and then Reed and Carroll went to Cuba together. Lazear had already<lb/>
been there three months--P.S. Hench, M.D.)</p>
<p>I concur in this<lb/>
Note by JRK- 4/14/46-<lb/>
I remember distinctly that Reed told me that when he went <unclear>next</unclear><lb/>
Aug 2- he asked Gen. Sternberg about investigating Finlays mosquito theory<lb/>
Gen. Sternbergs reply was you can do it if you wish but you will be wasting your<lb/>
time.</p>
