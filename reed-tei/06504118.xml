General Albert E. Truby<lb/>
145 Laurel Street<lb/>
San Francisco, California<lb/>
</dateline>
<salute>My dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you for your letter of November 5. The Cubans have not left out Lazear<lb/>
or Carroll. They each are having a special medallion made, a profile. Five<lb/>
or six round medallions will honor the main workers and will occupy (I am<lb/>
told) the center of the wall. On either and will be a bronze tablet naming<lb/>
others and I think you were looking at the list of names for those bronze<lb/>
tablets on the side. However they did leave out Doctor Pinto and Captain<lb/>
Stark. I spent many, many hours this summer collecting for Pedro a complete<lb/>
list of everybody connected with the affair. I recommended the inclusion of<lb/>
Doctor Pinto and Captain Stark but apparently the committee decided to honor,<lb/>
at least on the main tablets, essentially those who worked at Camp Lazear.<lb/>
However they later added a small list of names of those who cooperated,<lb/>
including the names of yourself and General Kean. I did not recommend<lb/>
the inclusion of Miss Warner's name but I did suggest the inclusion of<lb/>
Ames and Lambert. Having sent my long list and my suggestions (a copy<lb/>
of which I am sure I sent you) I later sent two or three other letters<lb/>
to Pedro but when he and his committee (who else is on it I do not know)<lb/>
made their final decision I just didn't have any more pep in me to argue<lb/>
at long distance. I had hoped that some of those to whom I wrote would<lb/>
write to him and make their own suggestions. Perhaps they did. If so,<lb/>
I received no carbons.</p>
<p>Thank you for your note about Dr. Mazzuri and John Peter Barstow. I will<lb/>
write the Minneapolis Tribune.</p>
<p>I am so glad that you are home again. You have had a long, hard time and<lb/>
although undoubtedly you were splendidly cared for in the Letterman Hospital,<lb/>
&ldquo;there is no place like home.&rdquo; How I wish I could drop in on you for a nice<lb/>
whole day's chat. I shall fly to Havana, spend two or three days there and<lb/>
fly back. Thereafter I will certainly write you and send you some photo-<lb/>
graphs of the affair. If I were a millionaire, I would charter a plane and<lb/>
pick up some very dear friends of yellow fever fame, you and Mrs. Truby<lb/>
especially, and fly them down to this affair, but alas it seems to be illness<lb/>
more than finances that prevents most of those who should go from going.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
