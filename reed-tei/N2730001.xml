<p>NOTED DOCTORS<lb/>
AT THE HOPKINS</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>ATTENDED OPENING OF SURGICAL<lb/>
LABORATORY.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Appointments and Arrangements Pro-<lb/>
nounced to Be the Finest in the<lb/>
Country--Tablet to Memory of Dr.<lb/>
Lazear, Who Lost His Life in the<lb/>
Interest of Science--Warm Tribute<lb/>
Paid to the Hospital--Addresses<lb/>
Made by Local and Visiting Scien-<lb/>
tific Men--Those Who Attended.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Learned medical men from far and<lb/>
near gathered at the Johns Hopkins<lb/>
Hospital yesterday morning to celebrate<lb/>
the opening of the magnificent new<lb/>
surgical laboratory which has just been<lb/>
completed at the cost of $150,000.</p>
<p>In the afternoon exercises were held<lb/>
in the clinical lecture-room for the un-<lb/>
veiling of the bronze tablet to Dr. Jesse<lb/>
Lazear, and at night Dr. Clifford Albutt,<lb/>
the eminent physician of London, made<lb/>
an address to the Johns Hopkins medi-<lb/>
cal students upon the opening of the<lb/>
school year.</p>
<p>The new surgical laboratory is de-<lb/>
clared unequalled by all who have in-<lb/>
spected it. The surgical amphitheater<lb/>
is the most up-to-date result of modern<lb/>
architecture and medical ideas that is<lb/>
known, and it may well be regarded<lb/>
with admiration. Built entirely of white<lb/>
marble, tile, steel and enamel, it is the<lb/>
embodiment of surgical cleanliness. The<lb/>
seating arrangement is made of steel<lb/>
upon a conical foundation of white tile,<lb/>
which will allow every portion of it to<lb/>
be easily cleaned, and the facilities for<lb/>
observing operations are excellent.<lb/>
Upon either side of the amphitheater<lb/>
are rooms for special surgical cases,<lb/>
and all through the four-story building<lb/>
there are any number of toilet rooms<lb/>
fitted out with the most perfect and ex-<lb/>
pensive appointments. There is abund-<lb/>
ant room for lecturing purposes, and an<lb/>
improved water-cushion elevator for the<lb/>
gentle removal of patients from one<lb/>
floor to another.</p>
<p>A Notable Gathering.</p>
<p>The gathering yesterday was notable,<lb/>
including physicians from Europe and<lb/>
many states of this country. The ex-<lb/>
ercises were opened by Judge Henry D.<lb/>
Harian, president of the board of trus-<lb/>
tees of the Johns Hopkins Hospital,<lb/>
who reviewed the work accomplished by<lb/>
the university and hospital and impor-<lb/>
tant incidents of its recent history, es-<lb/>
pecially the loss of Dr. Osler and the<lb/>
losses the institution suffered in the<lb/>
great fire. He also rendered thanks to<lb/>
Mr. Rockefeller, who came to the aid<lb/>
of the hospital to offset the reverses<lb/>
received from the fire.</p>
<p>The exercises were held in the clin-<lb/>
ical amphitheater, on the first floor of<lb/>
the new building, and a large number<lb/>
of extra chairs had to be supplied to<lb/>
seat the large audience which was pres-<lb/>
ent.</p>
<p>Dr. William H. Welch, in introducing<lb/>
Dr. William S. Halsted, surgeon-in-<lb/>
chief to the hospital, said that the credit<lb/>
for the new building was largely due to<lb/>
the latter. Dr. Halsted's address dis-<lb/>
cussed the points of the new building,<lb/>
and Dr. Lewis A. Stimpson, professor<lb/>
of surgery in the Cornell University<lb/>
Medical School, paid a high tribute to<lb/>
the prowess of the Hopkins Medical<lb/>
School, and especially Dr. Halsted, in<lb/>
surgical science.</p>
<p>Dr. T. Clifford Albutt, regius professor<lb/>
of medicine in Cambridge University,<lb/>
spoke in highest admiration for the<lb/>
progress made by the Johns Hopkins<lb/>
University in so few years. He said<lb/>
that he was instrumental in taking Dr.<lb/>
Osler not to a higher sphere, but to an-<lb/>
other sphere. He also discussed the re-<lb/>
lationship which should exist between<lb/>
the surgical laboratory and the hos-<lb/>
pital ward.</p>
<p>Prof. Abraham Jacobi, emeritus pro-<lb/>
fessor of the diseases of children at<lb/>
Columbia University, New York, could<lb/>
have uttered no higher compliment to<lb/>
the Johns Hopkins University than when<lb/>
he said yesterday that &ldquo;there is no bet-<lb/>
ter way to medicine than through the<lb/>
Johns Hopkins.&rdquo; Former President Dan-<lb/>
iel C. Gilman spoke in eulogy of Drs.<lb/>
Lazear and Walter Reed.</p>
<p>Bronze Tablet Unveiled.</p>
<p>A luncheon was served at noon, and<lb/>
following this the bronze tablet to Dr.<lb/>
Lazear in the clinical amphitheater was<lb/>
unveiled. Dr. Lazear, to whom the tablet<lb/>
is erected, was assistant resident physi-<lb/>
cian of the Johns Hopkins Hospital,<lb/>
when he was appointed in 1900 by Presi-<lb/>
dent McKinley a member of the com-<lb/>
mission to investigate yellow fever in<lb/>
Cuba. The commission succeeded in its<lb/>
design of preventing the ravages of the<lb/>
disease, but Dr. Lazear lost his life as a<lb/>
result of his researches. The addresses<lb/>
were made by Dr. Osler, Dr. James Car-<lb/>
roll, of the United States Army; Dr.<lb/>
William S. Thayer. Drs. Carroll and<lb/>
Thayer were both associated with Dr.<lb/>
Lazear upon the commission.</p>
<p>The tablet is about 4 feet by 4 and is<lb/>
inscribed as follows:</p>
<p>In Memory of<lb/>
JESSE WILLIAM LAZEAR,<lb/>
Graduate in Arts at<lb/>
Johns Hopkins University in 1889<lb/>
And in Medicine at Columbia University<lb/>
in 1892;<lb/>
In 1895-96 assistant resident physician<lb/>
in the Johns Hopkins Hospital,<lb/>
Member of the Yellow Fever Commission<lb/>
in 1900,<lb/>
With rank of acting assistant surgeon.<lb/>
He died of yellow fever at<lb/>
Quemados, Cuba.<lb/>
September 25, 1900.</p>
<p>With more than the courage and devo-<lb/>
tion of the soldier he risked and lost his<lb/>
life to show how a fearful pestilence<lb/>
is communicated and how its ravages<lb/>
may be prevented.</p>
