JOSEPH F. SILER<lb/>
PRESIDENT<lb/>
MAURICE H. THATCHER<lb/>
VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL<lb/>
WALTER A. BLOEDORN<lb/>
SECRETARY<lb/>
Dr. Philip S. Hench<lb/>
Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Rochester, Minn<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wrote you on September 12th concerning a number of matters. Since writing<lb/>
that letter I have been able to talk with Col. Kimborough, head of the Urological<lb/>
Service at Walter Reed, and I am afraid that I gave you incorrect information on<lb/>
some points. Col. Kimborough tells me that when General Kean was admitted to the<lb/>
hospital he had complete retention and it was necessary to use a catheter to keep<lb/>
the bladder emptied. Col. Kimborough was away from the hospital for a few days<lb/>
after Gen. Kean was admitted and during this absence a compley survey was made of<lb/>
Gen. Kean's general physical condition. When Kimborough returned it was decided<lb/>
that it would not be possible to remove the prostate under any circumstances on<lb/>
account of Gen. Kean's age and the condition of his heart. It was felt, however,<lb/>
that something would have to be done to relieve the constant retention and a<lb/>
suprapubic custostomy was carried out under local anesthesia. Unfortunately Gen.<lb/>
Kean had a stroke subsequent to the operation and this was complicated by pneumonia<lb/>
which required use of an oxygen tent for several days.</p>
<p>With further reference to Blossom Reed's letter to you, I think you can dis-<lb/>
regard it entirely as it was written at a time when Blossom was not thining pro-<lb/>
perly. Sha has been in the Psychopathic Ward at Walter Reed for a week or more<lb/>
and during the past three days her mental condition has improved to some extent<lb/>
although she is still very greatly confused. It is my intention to go out and see<lb/>
her when she is somewhat better and I will write you later concerning her condition.<lb/>
As I have already written you, she is receiving and will continue to receive the<lb/>
monthly annuity of $84 from the Walter Reed Memorial Association. I shall also<lb/>
take up with General Reed the question of her property at Blue Ridge Summit. I do<lb/>
know that her home up there has been rented and General Reed expects to have her<lb/>
live with him after she is released from the hospital. If I receive any further<lb/>
information concerning her financial problems, I will pass it along to you in the<lb/>
near future.</p>
<p>We hope that it will be possible for you to attend the annual meeting this<lb/>
year. It will of course be necessary for us to elect a new President and also two<lb/>
new members of the Board as both General Kean and Dr. L. O. Haward have died re-<lb/>
cently.</p>
<p>I went down to Ft. McNair a few days ago and the grass around the marker is<lb/>
now looking quite well and I will soon have the photograph made and send you one.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
