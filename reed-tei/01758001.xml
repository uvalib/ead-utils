<salute>My own darling wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p><hi>Two</hi> mighty<lb/>
&ldquo;feet&rdquo; letters by yesterday's mail-<lb/>
one dated Oct. 5 &amp; the other Octr 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.<lb/>
Papa is much obliged to his dar-<lb/>
-ling wifie for writing him<lb/>
<hi>two</hi> letters every week, which is<lb/>
more by half than &ldquo;hubby&rdquo; does,<lb/>
and which shows how much<lb/>
she thinks of her ugly old Ari-<lb/>
-zona mantee. Love Papa's<lb/>
son's little heart!, papa is much<lb/>
obliged to him, too, for sending<lb/>
him some pretty rose leaves-<lb/>
To think that papa's darling<lb/>
Laurie has had these petals<lb/>
in his own darling &ldquo;ittle&rdquo;<lb/>
hands makes them very dear<lb/>
to papa's heart! Do you think,<lb/>
Emilie darling, that he appre-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01758002"/>
-ciates the fact that his papa<lb/>
is away from him? or does he<lb/>
mistake any gentleman for his<lb/>
&ldquo;daddie&rdquo; &amp; call him so? I wonder<lb/>
whether he would not know<lb/>
me, if I should come into the<lb/>
room? I really believe he<lb/>
would- I am certain that he<lb/>
would know me, if I should<lb/>
recall to his memory a few<lb/>
old apache expressions; such<lb/>
as &ldquo;ditn't, ditn't, day&rdquo;, and &ldquo;bad<lb/>
daddies&rdquo;- I had a letter from<lb/>
Pa, dated Octr 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, and he mentions<lb/>
<add>his</add> brightness,- says he thinks he<lb/>
is as smart as any child he<lb/>
ever saw, and that he begins<lb/>
to talk considerably- He<lb/>
seems to think a great deal<lb/>
of him, and never fails to mention<lb/>
both of <del>them</del> you in his letters.<lb/>
You can tell Dr John, for me,<lb/>
that Lawrence derives his<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01758003"/>
brightness from his mother,<lb/>
and his sweet disposition too-<lb/>
Now ain't we about <hi>even</hi>, lov-<lb/>
ie? Bless your sweet life and<lb/>
heart! You know every body says<lb/>
that he is <hi>just like</hi> his mother!<lb/>
Of course, lovie, dear, it must<lb/>
be remembered that he first<lb/>
sniffed the oxygen, so to speak,<lb/>
in the heart of the &ldquo;sierra blan-<lb/>
cas&rdquo;, and this fact must have<lb/>
<hi>something</hi> to do with his bright-<lb/>
-ness; besides, lovie, you must<lb/>
not forget that the five quarts<lb/>
of milk which he daily drank,<lb/>
was extracted from a very<lb/>
<hi>sensible</hi> cow; or as Jimmie<lb/>
&ldquo;spin up the Creek&rdquo; would<lb/>
say, a &ldquo;noble animal&rdquo;! All<lb/>
these things must be taken<lb/>
into consideration; and last<lb/>
and not least, that his papa<lb/>
(and mama, too) started him in<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01758004"/>
&ldquo;the way that he should go&rdquo;-<lb/>
Bless his sweet, innocent,<lb/>
life, papa prays every day<lb/>
that his health &amp; life may<lb/>
be spared, to be a joy &amp;<lb/>
comfort to mama &amp; papa!<lb/>
Talk to him very often about<lb/>
me, my precious wifie, and<lb/>
don't let him forget his papa.<lb/>
Make him guide the pencil<lb/>
very often in writing to his<lb/>
dear &ldquo;daddie&rdquo;, and kiss him many<lb/>
times every day for papa!<lb/>
I also had a letter, yesterday,<lb/>
from Colonel Biddle- You<lb/>
remember that he promised<lb/>
to have me ordered to Thomas.<lb/>
He writes that he did every<lb/>
thing he could, but that the<lb/>
Medical Director replied,<lb/>
&ldquo;Biddle, I won't do it! Apa-<lb/>
che is too large &amp; important<lb/>
a Post for a contract Doctor,<lb/>
and I can't accommodate you&rdquo;.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01758005"/>
Page 5. So you perceive, my<lb/>
precious darling, that my<lb/>
chances of going to Thomas are<lb/>
not very favorable. Of course,<lb/>
as far as Comfort is concerned<lb/>
there is no comparison be-<lb/>
-tween the two Posts. There are<lb/>
no quarters at Thomas, and<lb/>
plenty of dust &amp; heat to be<lb/>
endured. I wanted to go,<lb/>
as my precious Emilie knows,<lb/>
in order to be able to com-<lb/>
-municate more often with<lb/>
her and for no other reason.<lb/>
It would have been very<lb/>
convenient, when I am or-<lb/>
-dered out, next year, but I<lb/>
assure, my darling wifie,<lb/>
that when I am once re-<lb/>
-lieved, I won't waste<lb/>
much time, on the road, in<lb/>
hastening to my pretty, sweet<lb/>
wifie and boy! The Atchison<lb/>
Santa Fe and Topeka R. Road<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01758006"/>
will be at Albuquerque<lb/>
(a town situated &ldquo;hard by&rdquo; the<lb/>
Rio Grande, a river which is<lb/>
very hard to cross, when you<lb/>
have to wait three hours<lb/>
for a few thick headed, lazy<lb/>
Mexicans to make up their<lb/>
minds! Dost remember, lovie?)<lb/>
by the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of January, and by the<lb/>
time I am ordered out, it may<lb/>
be much nearer Apache.<lb/>
Mantee won't be on the way<lb/>
more than 12 or 14 days, at the<lb/>
outside! Do you hear that<lb/>
lovie? Won't that be perfectly<lb/>
splendid? Hesche, Enchaw!<lb/>
You ought to see the heap of<lb/>
pretties I got by yesterday's<lb/>
mail, lovie! Some nice &ldquo;gents<lb/>
balbriggan&rdquo; (&ldquo;I want to know&rdquo;,)<lb/>
and I can<del>t</del> now remove the<lb/>
&ldquo;Clothes-line&rdquo; from my heel-<lb/>
also four (4) good shirts,<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01758007"/>
which came to hand, just<lb/>
in time, as my others were<lb/>
beginning to give out at the<lb/>
button-holes in the neck-band;<lb/>
otherwise they haven't got<lb/>
a &ldquo;brack&rdquo; in them. I got, be-<lb/>
-sides, lovie, a pretty army<lb/>
cap. The first I received,<lb/>
about a month ago, was<lb/>
too small and I had to re-<lb/>
turn it. This one fits me ex-<lb/>
-actly, and of course, is very<lb/>
becoming! Ahem! &ldquo;<hi>Boodigs</hi>&rdquo;!<lb/>
I have now got collars,<lb/>
shirts &amp; socks - and a nice,<lb/>
new pair of full-dress pants<lb/>
which Krobrisch,(Captain<lb/>
Hentig's Co. Tailor,) made for<lb/>
me, out of cloth which I<lb/>
got from A.T. Stewarts- and<lb/>
all of which are paid for<lb/>
thank goodness - as well<lb/>
as my military cap too.<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01758008"/>
I have a bill of <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>5.00, for shoul-<lb/>
-der straps &amp; buttons to pay,<lb/>
and I shall send the money<lb/>
by this mail- Besides, I have<lb/>
sent to Mr Stewarts for 2 yds<lb/>
of nice, dark-blue, broad-cloth<lb/>
with which to have a good<lb/>
blouse made. I think the<lb/>
cloth and making will cost about<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>18- I am done buying quar-<lb/>
-termaster's blue cloth, as<lb/>
it wears out so quick &amp; be-<lb/>
-comes so easily soiled that<lb/>
it is a waste of money in<lb/>
the long run. The above are<lb/>
all the outside expenses I<lb/>
will have during the remain-<lb/>
der of the year- certainly <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>25<lb/>
will cover every thing. Now,<lb/>
as my little wifie wanted<lb/>
to know about how much we<lb/>
could save, I will enter into<lb/>
particulars a little bit. In the<lb/>
first place, darling, you say<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01758009"/>
(Page 9.) that you have enough<lb/>
to pay your way back to Nor-<lb/>
folk, and that Mr Vaughan has<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>60.00 of your money- well that<lb/>
is very good, for my darling wifie.<lb/>
The check of <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>50.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> which husband<lb/>
sent you on the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Octr &amp;<lb/>
which you have already re-<lb/>
-ceived by this time, will bring<lb/>
your money up to <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>110.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> when<lb/>
you get to Norfolk during<lb/>
the latter part of November.<lb/>
Now as you <add>have</add> a nice new dress<lb/>
&amp; hat to buy <add>for your darling self</add> &amp; some things for<lb/>
our little boy, I don't suppose<lb/>
my darling would have more<lb/>
than <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>25.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> left on, say, Decem-<lb/>
ber 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. Well, suppose, lovie,<lb/>
for argument's sake, we will<lb/>
take it for granted that you<lb/>
have <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>25.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> on Decr 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>; then<lb/>
if husband should send you<lb/>
a check for <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>50.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> more, wouldn't<lb/>
<hi>that</hi> take you through the year?<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01758010"/>
you understand, my precious<lb/>
wifie, that I am only supposing<lb/>
a case - and my darling little<lb/>
wifie is such an apt hand<lb/>
at paper &amp; pencil and making<lb/>
up accounts generally,(love<lb/>
her darling heart!) that I know<lb/>
she will grab her paper and<lb/>
pencil and go to figuring at<lb/>
once. Now, husband doesn't<lb/>
forget that he said, in the<lb/>
letter, enclosing the <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>50 check,<lb/>
that he was going to send you<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi><hi>75.</hi><hi rend="superscript">00</hi> more for the rest of the<lb/>
year, and he will do so, if you<lb/>
need it; but since mother<lb/>
is so anxious to add to our<lb/>
little sum, something more<lb/>
this year, I have made the<lb/>
above proposition- The idea<lb/>
of husband using <hi>thinner</hi><lb/>
paper &amp; thus saving on <hi>pos-<lb/>
tage stamps</hi> was too sweet<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01758011"/>
for <hi>any</hi> purpose; &amp; husband<lb/>
owes his wifie 42 kisses and<lb/>
a half for that suggestion!<lb/>
Now to return to the subject;<lb/>
if <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>50.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> more will pay mama's<lb/>
&amp; son's expenses till Jan. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>, then<lb/>
papa can save, at least, <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>175.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi><lb/>
or probably <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>200 during the re-<lb/>
-mainder of this year. If Mama<lb/>
will only bear in mind that<lb/>
papa's expenses will be, every<lb/>
month that papa remains<lb/>
in Arizona, about <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>50.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi>, and<lb/>
if she keeps an account of her<lb/>
monthly expenses, she will know<lb/>
about what we can save<lb/>
every month, next year-<lb/>
Going upon the basis of the<lb/>
amount mentioned above be-<lb/>
ing sufficient to carry you<lb/>
through the year, then ac-<lb/>
-cording to my figures, lovie<lb/>
dear, your expenses &amp; papa's<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01758012"/>
boy's, during the 8 months, from<lb/>
May 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> to Jan. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> will have<lb/>
been about <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>560.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi>, or at the<lb/>
rate of <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>70.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> a month. Now,<lb/>
my precious wifie, husband<lb/>
is perfectly satisfied with that<lb/>
showing, and he thinks mother, dear,<lb/>
has done well to keep her ex-<lb/>
penses down to that amount.<lb/>
Of course, my precious wifie,<lb/>
next year, you will not pay<lb/>
board all the time, and your<lb/>
expenses will be less. We will<lb/>
have to economize and save some-<lb/>
-thing, each month, in order<lb/>
to buy our furniture for<lb/>
our new home and lots of other<lb/>
things. But I have no fear<lb/>
on that point, as I know my<lb/>
precious wifie is just as anx-<lb/>
-ious to save &amp; have a nice,<lb/>
pretty home, and nice pretty things<lb/>
in it, as mantee is - and she will<lb/>
have a heap of &ldquo;pretties,&rdquo; won't you, lovie?<lb/>
<pb n="13" id="f01758013"/>
(Page 13.) Tuesday Morning Octr 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 79.<lb/>
Just to think, precious wifie, that<lb/>
October is almost gone, &amp; Novem-<lb/>
ber nearly here! One more month<lb/>
gone certainly, lovie, and husband<lb/>
is one month nearer his little<lb/>
wifie &amp; son! Oh! how I wish<lb/>
Jan. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1880 was here, for then I<lb/>
could begin to look forward<lb/>
to seeing my wife &amp; boy, during<lb/>
the year <hi>certainly</hi>. Time passes<lb/>
rapidly, my precious wife, but<lb/>
not near so fast, as it did when<lb/>
precious Mam<del>m</del>a &amp; son were at<lb/>
Apache, and not nearly so fast as<lb/>
I know it must pass with<lb/>
you, lovie. You have so many<lb/>
things to engage your attention;<lb/>
and so many little trips &amp; visits<lb/>
here and there, that the month<lb/>
must go by right quickly.<lb/>
At any rate, husband trusts<lb/>
that time does not hang heavy<lb/>
on his darling's hands. &ldquo;<hi>Boodigs</hi>&rdquo;!<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f01758014"/>
Mantee can't help from feeling<lb/>
lonely sometimes, for he has to<lb/>
sit in his room all alone,<lb/>
&amp; not a soul to talk to- But<lb/>
he does not complain of his<lb/>
fate, but awaits the coming<lb/>
days hopefully, trustfully-<lb/>
Dr McPherson has not yet<lb/>
returned. I think though that<lb/>
he will be back at apache<lb/>
within three weeks. Captain<lb/>
Hentig's company does not<lb/>
go to Thomas after all- Cap't.<lb/>
Foulk's company goes from<lb/>
Thomas to Grant, and Captain<lb/>
Tupper's Co. comes from Grant<lb/>
to Thomas. Captain McGowan<lb/>
goes to Fort Rucker and the<lb/>
company there of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Inf<lb/>
comes to apache. This brings<lb/>
Lt. Halloran &amp; wife &amp; Lt.<lb/>
Smith and wife- The former<lb/>
lady said to be a &ldquo;Bridget&rdquo;<lb/>
<pb n="15" id="f01758015"/>
of the &ldquo;purest ray serene;&rdquo; and<lb/>
the last named lady, Mrs. Smith<lb/>
is a blooming bride, from<lb/>
somewhere in New York State.<lb/>
As the &ldquo;Duchess&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Countess&rdquo; re-<lb/>
-main at apache, this will give<lb/>
us six (6) ladies. I tell Mrs.<lb/>
Hentig that the writer will<lb/>
be the liveliest ever known<lb/>
at Apache; in fact, one con-<lb/>
-tinual season of jollity<lb/>
and &ldquo;flow of soul&rdquo;, as it were.<lb/>
But the &ldquo;Duchess&rdquo; doubts my<lb/>
statement very much- She thinks<lb/>
there won't be life enough<lb/>
in the garrison to get up<lb/>
a pick nick even! It's very<lb/>
true that, at present, you<lb/>
would not know that there<lb/>
was a lady in the garrison.<lb/>
For a week at a time you<lb/>
never see one out of doors,<lb/>
&amp; this, too, while we are hav-<lb/>
<pb n="16" id="f01758016"/>
ing the most charming wea-<lb/>
ther. I never experienced more<lb/>
beautiful weather than we<lb/>
have had, for the last four<lb/>
or five days, and how they can<lb/>
stick in the house &amp; glue<lb/>
themselves to chair-bottoms<lb/>
so firmly, I can't see. If both<lb/>
of them were not cut out<lb/>
for princesses or queens,<lb/>
I am very much mistaken.<lb/>
Mrs. Hentig says now that<lb/>
she is going to compel the<lb/>
captain to go on a leave-<lb/>
But you know, my precious<lb/>
wifie, how much attention<lb/>
he pays to <hi>her compulsion</hi>.<lb/>
He certainly ought to have<lb/>
money enough to take him<lb/>
on a leave, for since the ad-<lb/>
-vent of our new <unclear>C.O.</unclear>, the<lb/>
season of gambling has been<lb/>
a very brisk one, &amp; cap't. Hen-<lb/>
-tig generally wins when he plays.<lb/>
<pb n="17" id="f01758017"/>
(Page 17.) Didn't I tell you, my<lb/>
precious wifie, that if Mrs.<lb/>
Hentig expected too much of<lb/>
her new soldier Cook, Mr &ldquo;Speck&rdquo;,<lb/>
that she would be disappointed.<lb/>
Well, it was just as I said-<lb/>
The Captain told &ldquo;Speck&rdquo; to have<lb/>
a pair of chickens roasted<lb/>
for dinner, &amp; Mrs. Harrison<lb/>
told me of their appearance,<lb/>
when they were brought in-<lb/>
necks &amp;&ldquo;pope's noses&rdquo; gone!<lb/>
wings cut close off to their<lb/>
bodies, and then both chickens<lb/>
perfectly &amp; neatly <hi>skinned</hi>!<lb/>
She says that they looked<lb/>
actually so funny, that none<lb/>
of them knew what they<lb/>
were, &amp; that when they did<lb/>
find out, they nearly split<lb/>
their sides laughing! The legs,<lb/>
by the way, were left on &amp; were<lb/>
sticking straight up in the<lb/>
air, as a mild protest on<lb/>
<pb n="18" id="f01758018"/>
on the part of the birds, for<lb/>
their shabby treatment by<lb/>
Se&ntilde;or &ldquo;Speck&rdquo;! Salt on pies,<lb/>
and Sugar in Soup are pret-<lb/>
ty difficult ideas to surpass,<lb/>
but I think Mr &ldquo;Speck&rdquo; will<lb/>
get up something more en-<lb/>
-tertaining than either of those,<lb/>
if he is only given time and<lb/>
opportunity- I have con-<lb/>
gratulated the &ldquo;Duchess&rdquo; hear-<lb/>
-tily upon her new &ldquo;Menial-&rdquo;<lb/>
I have advised her to ap-<lb/>
-point &ldquo;Tom&rdquo; Hentig as &ldquo;first<lb/>
assistant&rdquo;! Hesche, enchaw!<lb/>
Present my regards to Miss Lou<lb/>
Woodward and tell her that Lt.<lb/>
Mills, necklace and all, have ta-<lb/>
-ken their departure for the<lb/>
Southern part of the territory,<lb/>
or else I would insist upon<lb/>
his forwarding the ornament<lb/>
at once. However, if allowable,<lb/>
<pb n="19" id="f01758019"/>
Congratulate her for me, on the<lb/>
acquisition which she has<lb/>
obtained in the shape of Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Don Vaughauero- Now, if you<lb/>
think, my darling wifie, that<lb/>
she would be angry, if you<lb/>
you should tell her the above,<lb/>
don't mention <add>it</add> for all the world.<lb/>
I would like to be in Mur-<lb/>
-freesboro, just to see how<lb/>
gallant the young lad makes<lb/>
himself, &amp; the winsome glan-<lb/>
-ces which the lassie gives<lb/>
in return! &ldquo;I want to know&rdquo;!<lb/>
Please enlighten my stupidity,<lb/>
beauty, dear, by telling me<lb/>
who Miss Mollie Day was,<lb/>
and also the &ldquo;noble&rdquo; &ldquo;gent&rdquo; whom<lb/>
she caught on the wing- as<lb/>
it were- I really can't &ldquo;locate&rdquo;<lb/>
her, as C. Reed, would say-<lb/>
By the way, has the festive<lb/>
Don Grimes lead any maiden<lb/>
<pb n="20" id="f01758020"/>
coy to the altar yet? I<lb/>
really have forgotten whether<lb/>
you told me that he was<lb/>
married or not- and Miss<lb/>
Nellie is no longer the <add>reig<del>h</del>ning</add> <del>raining</del><lb/>
(blast the spelling!) beauty? Ah!<lb/>
I am afraid, she has rejected<lb/>
one too many! But my little<lb/>
&ldquo;Nemps&rdquo; wan't caught napping<lb/>
that way, was she, lovie? I<lb/>
tell you, the first beau that<lb/>
came along, she &ldquo;knabbed&rdquo; him,<lb/>
and a <hi>fine boy</hi> with him!<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi>Boodigs, enchaw&rdquo;</hi>! She wasn't<lb/>
going to &ldquo;waste her sweetness<lb/>
on the desert air&rdquo;- although<lb/>
she has had a pretty good<lb/>
opportunity of doing so since.<lb/>
(Colorado <hi>desert</hi>, lovie,- &ldquo;<hi>Boodigs</hi>&rdquo;)<lb/>
But I can't write any more,<lb/>
this time - Be a good, sweet, true,<lb/>
loving little wifie &amp; take good<lb/>
care of papa's darling boy- Kisses<lb/>
for Mama &amp; son &amp; bushels of love.<lb/>
Best love to all homefolks, and re-<lb/>
gards to all inquiring friends-</p>

<salute>Ever,<lb/>
lovie, your own fond &amp; devoted &ldquo;hub&rdquo;.</salute>
