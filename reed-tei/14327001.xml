<salute>Dear Mumsie-</salute>
</opener>
<p>You must forgive<lb/>
me for having let<del>ter</del><lb/>
a week pass without<lb/>
writing to you for I<lb/>
have been so busy I<lb/>
have scarcely had<lb/>
time to breathe. To<lb/>
begin with was our<lb/>
card party on Tuesday,<lb/>
a hop on Wednesday,<lb/>
and moving on Wednes-<lb/>
day too, the Gen. came<lb/>
to dinner Friday and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14327002"/>
yesterday we went to<lb/>
town to see the dear<lb/>
old General off. It<lb/>
was a sad day for<lb/>
us all, as you can<lb/>
imagine, and I think<lb/>
the General felt very<lb/>
blue too, over the break-<lb/>
ing up of his staff<lb/>
and leaving Cuba for<lb/>
good.</p>
<p>But to go back to<lb/>
the card party. Mrs.<lb/>
Stark and I worked<lb/>
like slaves for three<lb/>
days, and were reward-<lb/>
ed by having the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14327003"/>
party a great success. To begin<lb/>
with the <unclear>piazza</unclear> of the Starks cot-<lb/>
tage was nearly all enclosed with<lb/>
tent flys, and we had five card<lb/>
tables out there and one in the<lb/>
parlor. The party was from half<lb/>
past three to six for neither of<lb/>
us would upset the children by<lb/>
having an evening affair. The house<lb/>
was really beautiful decorated with-<lb/>
in and without with palms and<lb/>
roses and those bright foliage plants<lb/>
from the palace. About fifty people<lb/>
came and as each one arrived they<lb/>
were given a mint julep. Mrs. Stark<lb/>
said that was the way they<lb/>
did in Norfolk, and it seemed to<lb/>
work very well in Cuba. Then they<lb/>
were put to playing six handed<lb/>
euchre, but that did not last<lb/>
very long for we had to begin<lb/>
serving tea promptly at five to<lb/>
get it in before dark. We fed them<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14327004"/>
2<lb/>
well on creamed chicken<lb/>
and mushrooms, baked<lb/>
in little Cuban bowls,<lb/>
Saratoga chips, lobster<lb/>
salad, deviled ham &amp;<lb/>
lettuce sandwiches, olives<lb/>
salted almonds, hot<lb/>
chocolate, cold punch<lb/>
(claret) and pineapple<lb/>
ice served with those<lb/>
crispy Cuban &ldquo;horns&rdquo; they<lb/>
give you in the cafe's.<lb/>
Mrs. Jackson won the<lb/>
ladies' first prize, a<lb/>
palm in a red water<lb/>
jar, Capt. Sickle's the<lb/>
gentlemen's, a box of<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14327005"/>
Henry Clays, and Mr.<lb/>
Day the booby prize, a<lb/>
<add>little</add> mule that walked<lb/>
across the floor kicking.<lb/>
Everybody seems to<lb/>
have had a splendid<lb/>
time, and Mrs. Stark<lb/>
and I are sure the<lb/>
&ldquo;eatings&rdquo; were the best<lb/>
and the party the<lb/>
jolliest that has ever<lb/>
been given here. That<lb/>
afternoon Martha and<lb/>
the Stark boys had a<lb/>
&ldquo;card party&rdquo; at my house<lb/>
in which the little<lb/>
freezer played a prominent<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14327006"/>
 part.</p>
<p>The next day I moved from the cottage<lb/>
into the row and I am not yet<lb/>
entirely settled into my three rooms,<lb/>
for tho' I brought so little down<lb/>
<unclear>with</unclear> me and Rannie seemed to<lb/>
have very little in his room the<lb/>
whole face of the earth is covered<lb/>
with our stuff. And I have the<lb/>
prospect of another move in about<lb/>
six weeks, when Dr. Havard comes<lb/>
back and Rannie is made post<lb/>
surgeon here.</p>
<p>Our party was Wednesday and the<lb/>
hop in honor of the General Thursday<lb/>
night. The pavilion was decorated<lb/>
with the palms from Mrs. Starks, and<lb/>
there was a big crowd for it was<lb/>
the first dance in nearly six months<lb/>
and the people came from Vedado<lb/>
and Caba&ntilde;a. No Cubanos <unclear>tho'.</unclear></p>
<p>Mrs. Dun and Mrs. Slocum arrived<lb/>
last Monday, so our house is full<lb/>
and Mrs. Dun is running the<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f14327007"/>
3<lb/>
<unclear>mess</unclear> with her ser-<lb/>
vants she brought from<lb/>
the north. She is<lb/>
a very nice little<lb/>
woman, a sister of<lb/>
Dalzell <del>the</del><add>of</add> Gale base<lb/>
ball fame, and she<lb/>
knew Tom at New Haven.<lb/>
We are sad at the<lb/>
prospect of losing the<lb/>
Duns in a few days,<lb/>
for they are going to<lb/>
move to Quemados<lb/>
into the House of<lb/>
the Lions, you remem-<lb/>
ber it, don't you? Then<lb/>
I will keep house with<lb/>
<unclear>Rufinia</unclear>, for Mrs. Slocum<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f14327008"/>
is so deaf she can't,<lb/>
but she says she will<lb/>
teach <unclear>Rufinia</unclear> to cook<lb/>
lots of things. I knew<lb/>
Mrs. S. and I would<lb/>
get on finely together<lb/>
and we are great<lb/>
cronies already. While<lb/>
I am devoted to Capt.<lb/>
Slocum, he is so sweet<lb/>
to me. (You needn't<lb/>
tell Helen and Caz.)</p>
<p>Lots of people turned<lb/>
out to see the General<lb/>
Major Michie and Mrs.<lb/>
Mc Cormick off on the<lb/>
Morro Castle yesterday.<lb/>
The band went down<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f14327009"/>
too and played vigorously all the<lb/>
time. I drove down from <unclear>Coacha</unclear> with<lb/>
the General and he had a beau-<lb/>
tiful, enormous bunch of roses for<lb/>
me. We all went on board the<lb/>
Morro Castle, which seems to be a<lb/>
very fine steamer, and then the<lb/>
General stood in the gangway and<lb/>
said goodbye to each of us as we<lb/>
went off. I know I nearly cried<lb/>
and I think from the looks of the<lb/>
ex. staff when they got back on<lb/>
the Baker they all felt as I did. Mr.<lb/>
Day, Mr. Rhea and Mr. Conrad all<lb/>
go up on the Mc Pherson Monday.<lb/>
Mr. Rhea has a six weeks leave<lb/>
and Mr. Humphrey is just back<lb/>
from one. He told me he left <hi>the<lb/>
family</hi> very well and he has come<lb/>
to see Bobbie so as to report on him,<lb/>
as he was ordered to do.</p>
<p>I wish you could see your Bobs, he<lb/>
is the very picture of health and<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f14327010"/>
4<lb/>
smiles at everybody<lb/>
that speaks to him.<lb/>
He never cries, except<lb/>
yesterday, when I<lb/>
took him out of his<lb/>
bath sooner than he<lb/>
wished me to, so<lb/>
he scolded and cried<lb/>
all the time I was<lb/>
dressing him and<lb/>
stopped as soon as I<lb/>
gave him to Emma.</p>
<p>I am so sorry Peg<lb/>
did not get to Augusta<lb/>
she must have been<lb/>
dreadfully disappointed.<lb/>
Did any of you go to<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f14327011"/>
Mrs. Twombly's dance?<lb/>
Was it a costume affair?</p>
<p>Nov 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Dearest Mummy</p>
<p>I go down today to take<lb/>
Col. Havards office and<lb/>
Louise has opened one<lb/>
eye to tell me to finish<lb/>
her letter to you and put<lb/>
it in the mail. From<lb/>
the present length of it I<lb/>
dont think it needs much<lb/>
finishing. I was very glad<lb/>
to get your letter the day<lb/>
before yesterday, and to<lb/>
hear your opinion as regard<lb/>
the latest theory concerning<lb/>
the &ldquo;pestilence that flyest<lb/>
by night.&rdquo; Reed and I have<lb/>
taken great enjoyment out<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f14327012"/>
of the airy &amp; superior tone of the lay papers<lb/>
with regard to the mosquito theory. The<lb/>
medical journals on the contrary treat<lb/>
it with much consideration. Did you<lb/>
see the N. Y. Herald's editorial? Well<lb/>
in a couple of months I hope Reed<lb/>
will show them how much they dont<lb/>
know. We are still very much in the<lb/>
air as regards our quarters &amp; status<lb/>
generally. I am at the present the proud<lb/>
possessor of a <unclear>barouche</unclear> &amp; pair of<lb/>
blocks but fear to lose them any day.<lb/>
Goodbye dear gran.</p>
