<salute>Dear Mr. LePrince:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wonder if you will be so very kind as to help me out<lb/>
with the enclosed bibliography, so far as field work will permit? As<lb/>
you may see, my references are very incomplete, which makes them <hi>extremely</hi><lb/>
hard to find, when there are so many journals in which they might have<lb/>
appeared. I especially want your bibliography--i. e. every publication<lb/>
in which you mention the occasional occurrence of aegypti larvae in street<lb/>
gutters. I think there is another ref. to some article of yours <hi>re</hi> aegypti<lb/>
breeding (in winter) in some hotel, but I have not access to my files to-day<lb/>
<add>Will you please give me this ref also &ldquo;<unclear>per si [unclear]?</unclear>&rdquo;</add></p>
<p>Of course, I don't expect you to be able to help me with all of<lb/>
the enclosed references, but any that you can give will be a god-send and<lb/>
perhaps Dr. Barber might have some literature available which you haven't.</p>
<p>I am hoping and praying that I will get my references in such<lb/>
shape that I can go over to Baltimore next month and take them to Frost, in<lb/>
order that he may do the final editing of Father's MSS before we send it<lb/>
in to the I. H. D. for publication<del>.</del> <add>which we hope to do in November<unclear>.</unclear></add> I wish much that the early publication<lb/>
of Father's book were not so very important, as (despite the time that has<lb/>
already been spent on it) I should like to spend the whole of next winter<lb/>
on winding it up as he would have liked to have it. However, it <hi>is</hi> needed<lb/>
now as &ldquo;ammunition&rdquo; so I've been working from seven to ten hours per diem<lb/>
on it ever since I got back from the Hopkins last March (after two months<lb/>
there on account of &ldquo;flu.&rdquo;) I have a wonderful Secretary (one of the staff<lb/>
of the Library of Congress) and she and I, after two and a half months at<lb/>
the aforesaid Library checking &ldquo;pre-historic&rdquo; references to yellow fever in<lb/>
six languages, are now at the Library of the S. G. of the Army working up<lb/>
the purely medical references. These are <hi>dreadful</hi> as Father knew them all<lb/>
so well that he didn't record them in his bibliographic notes. Had he done<lb/>
so we had finished e'er now. As it is, things that he could have cleared up<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0323018"/>
up <add>for me</add><lb/>
-2-<lb/>
in a few hours will take us as many weeks. However, Father was wise to<lb/>
stick to the text of his MSS, which no one else could do, and leave the<lb/>
&ldquo;mechanics&rdquo; to the future. <add>We <hi>just</hi> finished as it was!</add></p>
<p>I think so often of &ldquo;the Malaria Gang&rdquo; and hope sometime to see you<lb/>
during your flying visits to Washington.</p>
<p>With all manner of remembrances to each one of you, and also to<lb/>
your family, I remai<del>i</del><add>n</add></p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly your friend,</salute>
Senior Sanitary Engineer J. A. LePrince,<lb/>
U. S. Public Health <unclear>Service</unclear>,<lb/>
Office of Field Investigations of Malaria,<lb/>
Richmond, Va.<lb/>
Please forward.<lb/>
<seg>
P. S. I got a note from Theodore Hayne just before he sailed<lb/>
for West Africa. I don't b<del>a</del><add>l</add>ame him for going, but I hope that the Service<lb/>
will get him eventually.<lb/>
