<salute>Dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your interesting letter of Dec. 24th received in<lb/>
due time and I would have answered sooner, but you know that a man in<lb/>
the field is liable to let his correspondence drag a little in hopes<lb/>
of having more to write about.</p>
<p>I have been very busy lately in as much as we have three<lb/>
new projects under construction. The policy of cutting and burning<lb/>
all trees and vegetation in ponded areas of this concern is indeed a<lb/>
large undertaking, and as you have already said, is a most important<lb/>
one.</p>
<p>The company decided last summer to raise the Wateree<lb/>
dam six feet, this work started, one might say, overnight. We immediate-<lb/>
ly began clearing out new area. The dam is about completed and we<lb/>
are about through clearing although I am going to keep some crews at<lb/>
work for some time yet. It is doubtful if this pond will ever be<lb/>
allowed to completely fill up. I am going to make a careful and com-<lb/>
plete study of this project for next few years and in meantime use<lb/>
means to control breeding should any occur.</p>
<p>I guess you have seen a copy of regulations on im-<lb/>
pounded waters recently passed by South Carolina State Board of<lb/>
Health. They are very good and if properly complied with will<lb/>
certainly reduce malaria in South Carolina. I am doing all in my<lb/>
power to see that my people strictly comply with them.</p>

Dr. Carter.</p>
<p>We are raising the old Catawba dam (above Rock Hill<lb/>
S. C.) forty feet. This is going to be about largest pond we will have.<lb/>
(Shore line about 222 miles) We have about seven hundred men on this<lb/>
clearing project and have two years to get clearing completed. This is<lb/>
a very bad and malarious area and I am taking every means to stamp out<lb/>
malaria in this community as a whole.</p>
<p>As to Rhodhiss, about forty miles below Bridgewater dam,<lb/>
this project will be completed in about three weeks. This pond will<lb/>
have a shore line of about eighty miles and the general terrain is<lb/>
about same as Bridgewater. We are about through clearing this area<lb/>
and I am now making my last inspection before dam is closed. We have<lb/>
about twenty five sawdust piles in this area, mostly old ones, they will<lb/>
not burn, so I am dragging them down and I do not believe they will<lb/>
float or give me much trouble however, I am sure they will bear watching.</p>
<p>The company is cooperating with me fine in all my under-<lb/>
takings and I can now begin to see results in some of my work.</p>
<p>My fish (gambusia) experiments have and are working<lb/>
out fine and I have had good success in raising a large number of them.<lb/>
There are great things but I dare not place to much confidence in them,<lb/>
as my areas are large.</p>
<p>I will keep you posted during the year as to my work as<lb/>
I know you are interested.</p>
<p>Certainly trust your health is improving, and I hope to<lb/>
get <add>up</add> to see you before spring. Everyone here sends kindest regards and<lb/>
