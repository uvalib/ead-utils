<p>White informs Hench that he knew Reed and Carroll well and was the anesthetist for Reed's last operation. He believes Carroll's mosquito bite was accidental, not experimental. White encloses a manuscript characterizing the two men and describing Reed's operation.</p>

<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your interest in the history of the Yellow Fever Commission<lb/>
prompts me to write concerning some <xref id="f03906045">facts</xref> about Doctor Walter Reed<lb/>
and Doctor James Carroll. These facts are of little importance in<lb/>
themselves but I thought they might add something to your store of<lb/>
information.</p>
<p>Doctor Reed was Professor of Bacteriology and Pathology and<lb/>
Doctor Carroll was his assistant in the medical school here which<lb/>
I attended (Columbian University, now George Washington University).<lb/>
I graduated in 1898 and became an instructor or demonstrator in the<lb/>
school under Reed and Carroll and consequently knew them very well.<lb/>
A few years later I became interested in anesthesia and devoted a<lb/>
large part of my leisure time, which I had then, to my work, and was<lb/>
among the first to use nitrous oxide as a preliminary to ether, with<lb/>
the original Bennett inhaler. For some reason I had quite a local<lb/>
reputation and when Doctor Reed was operated on in his last illness<lb/>
I <hi>was called upon to give the</hi> anesthetic at the Army Hospital in this<lb/>
city. <hi>Col. Borden operated</hi> and I recall the details of the operation<lb/>
quite well.</p>
<p>Doctor Carroll was the pathologist, on a part time basis, at a<lb/>
Hospital in this city with which I was connected and I remember dis-<lb/>
tinctly when he announced his departure for Cuba. It has been my<lb/>
impression that Carroll was accidentally bitten by a mosquito and<lb/>
that he did not submit to inoculation as Cornwall has so wonderfully<lb/>
portrayed on canvas. Carroll returned and lived in Washington until<lb/>
he died of a heart ailment, a sequela of his infection.</p>
<p>Please disregard this letter if what I have written is not of<lb/>
any help to you. Your interest in the Commission came to my attention<lb/>
and I thought perhaps some of these minor details might be of value.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
