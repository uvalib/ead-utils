<salute>Dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Gen. A.G. Love Med Corps Retd<lb/>
Took me to Walter Reed on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
to see Gen. Ireland. His condition is<lb/>
lamentable. He cannot any longer sit up<lb/>
or apparently use his muscles in any<lb/>
way or say a word. He did smile when<lb/>
he saw me which was a great comfort<lb/>
to me for I feared he might not know<lb/>
me. Gen. Love was at Walter Reed to<lb/>
hear your address which he said was<lb/>
wonderful, and said that the hall was<lb/>
jammed, as many as could crowd in.<lb/>
He wished to speak to you, but you were<lb/>
so surrounded that he had to give it up<lb/>
and come away. I hope that you were<lb/>
able to have a talk with Surg. Gen. Bliss<lb/>

If you did not I will ask Siler to write<lb/>
you about the Tablet. Before putting<lb/>
Powell's book &ldquo;Bring Out Your Dead&rdquo; on the<lb/>
shelf I wanted to make a few comments<lb/>
He mentions Walter Reed in the preface<lb/>
and gives him credit for having <hi>discovered</hi><lb/>
the transmission of yellow fever by the<lb/>
female mosquito, which Reed never claimed<lb/>
and which we know is not true. I always<lb/>
&check; <add>Think,</add> as you know, that the word <hi>demonstrated</hi><lb/>
should be used for his great accomplish<lb/>
ment. The name of Carlos Finlay is not men-<lb/>
tioned. Of course this will enrage our Cuban<lb/>
friends, and destroy the value of his book<lb/>
for them. Powell is such a well informed man<lb/>
that they will regard the error as intentional.<lb/>
There seem to have been quite a number of second<lb/>
attacks, and in some the second was fatal.<lb/>
Dr. Finlay regarded second attacks as very rare<lb/>
and I suppose in such cases the first fever<lb/>
was malarial or from some other cause.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f06501086"/>
<p>3</p>
<p>There were some fine doctors in Phila<lb/>
Currie for instance and fat Hutchinson<lb/>
&check; the Post Physician who accepted Cur-<lb/>
rie's rational treatment, and might pro-<lb/>
bably have been saved if he had stayed<lb/>
quietly in bed instead of getting up and<lb/>
going down stairs and doing some writing<lb/>
during the remission. And Deveze the<lb/>
french man who had learned rational<lb/>
treatment of the disease in his practice<lb/>
in the West Indies. Was it not noble the<lb/>
way that Girard supported him at Bush<lb/>
Hill Hospital against all the fulminations<lb/>
of Dr. Rush and his followers. I think<lb/>
that Powell has done a great work in<lb/>
bringing to popular notice the nobility<lb/>
of Stephen Girard, and Helm, the Major<lb/>
Clarkson and his committee and the many<lb/>
brave men who stayed in the city to keep<lb/>
things going and provide food and money<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06501087"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
4<lb/>
and workmen to meet each emergency<lb/>
as it arose. The way the committee<lb/>
backed up Girard and Helm at Bush<lb/>
Hill and provided whatever they called<lb/>
for makes a fine story. I was sorry to<lb/>
read that Benjamin Rush got his inspira-<lb/>
tion as to treatment from a book by Dr.<lb/>
John Mitchell on his experience in Virginia<lb/>
in 1741 (page 77). The cool way in which<lb/>
Rush and his followers disregarded the<lb/>
&check; great experience<unclear>&check;</unclear> of the French doctors Deveze<lb/>
La Roche and <unclear>Menge's</unclear> is surprising and<lb/>
lamentable. I never read any of La Roche<lb/>
but remember that Walter Reed brought his<lb/>
fat 2 volumes to Cuba and was always<lb/>
quoting them. Just who was responsible<lb/>
&check; for the marvelous efficacy of the American<lb/>
treatment in Cuba? rest in bed from the<lb/>
beginning, no medicine and no food,<lb/>
until all fever left and then not made.<lb/>
You will remember that the mortality of<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06501088"/>
5<lb/>
such Americans as were under<lb/>
Army care and treatment, was only<lb/>
about 1&sol;3 of that of the Spanish<lb/>
laborers in Havana. Reed took much<lb/>
interest in the treatment of our cases<lb/>
but I do not recall that he made any<lb/>
changes in it or suggestions regarding<lb/>
it. I would be interested to know<lb/>
what La Roche had to say regarding<lb/>
treatment. The Cuban doctors always<lb/>
wanted to give a Saline purgative<lb/>
first thing.</p>
<p>Well this is enough about Powell's<lb/>
book. It is well written and indexed<lb/>
and shows much labor and discrim-<lb/>
ination.</p>
<p>I think that both Cornelia and I can now<lb/>
be discharged from sick Report. We<lb/>
send great regards to you and Mrs H</p>
