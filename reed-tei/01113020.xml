Dr. F. F. Russell, General Director,<lb/>
International Health Board,<lb/>
61 Broadway, New York, N. Y.,<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Replying to your letter of the 10th. inst., received yesterday, I<lb/>
would say that the description of the case of the Italian, given by<lb/>
Dr. Pettman, is--save in two points--that of yellow fever. Its devia-<lb/>
tions from type are, first that he was <hi>slightly</hi> jaundiced and next that<lb/>
the gums were not markedly swollen nor congested. The autposy as<lb/>
given is also that of yellow fever and the fact that &ldquo;the liver: kidneys<lb/>
and spleen were yellow&rdquo; rather implies that the slight jaundice noted a-<lb/>
bove may have been due to the man being very dark or some similar reason.<lb/>
In the absence of further data I would consider it yellow fever.</p>
<p>The same diagnosis is the most probable one in the case of Hanney--<lb/>
though the history is decidedly imperfect. If this man's attack dates<lb/>
from 9 A. M. April 3rd. his death at 3.30 A. M. the 6th. is unusually<lb/>
early. There is frequently error, however, in determining access of<lb/>
attack in a very ill patient.</p>
<p>I would not in general regard 2 days 7 hours from the attack as too<lb/>
late to administer the serum intra-venously--though the earlier this is<lb/>
done the better. Possibly the perturbation caused by the intra-venous<lb/>
injection--which to my own knowledge is decidedly painful sometimes--<lb/>
may have precipitated his death. Do you remember the statement of Dr.<lb/>
Alva Diaz of Ferrenafe that in light cases the injection of serum (in<lb/>
the muscle) was followed by immediate improvement in light cases but<lb/>
seemed to hasten death in the severe ones? Possibly this latter, if<lb/>
t occurred, was due to perturbation caused by the injection given<lb/>
ther late in the case when any little thing of that sort will cause<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01113021"/>
cause<lb/>
Russell 2<lb/>
death.</p>
<p>Of course you must furnish both serum and vaccine for these African<lb/>
outbreaks, yet I am very much afraid that--with the French especially--<lb/>
they will depend on the latter to immunize their European personnel and<lb/>
not do the <hi>aegypti</hi> work necessary for elimination. The fever in the<lb/>
meantime will persist among the natives and we will have no information<lb/>
of its occurrence. The only hope for the institution and earnest press-<lb/>
ing of <hi>aegypti</hi> control in Africa is the fear of the Europeans of yellow<lb/>
fever. If this be taken away or diminished by vaccination or any other<lb/>
means we would despair of its elimination.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
