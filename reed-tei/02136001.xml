Tuesday.<lb/>
</dateline>
<salute>Dearest Mother-:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here it is<lb/>
over a week since I last<lb/>
wrote you and to me it seems<lb/>
only yesterday-</p>
<p>To begin with<lb/>
I had a letter from Dr Truby<lb/>
at Columbia Bks this morning<lb/>
and he said that Father left<lb/>
Sunday on a Ward Liner<lb/>
for Washington, so I imagine<lb/>
that you will see him before<lb/>
this gets off of the island so<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02136002"/>
I know that again you<lb/>
are happy-</p>
<p>Your last letter<lb/>
took an unusual long<lb/>
time to reach me as I<lb/>
only got it yesterday morning<lb/>
I am glad that Blossom<lb/>
has found a new friend<lb/>
and I hope she will enjoy<lb/>
herself very much this winter.<lb/>
We are all wildly excited<lb/>
over <unclear>le</unclear> just at present<lb/>
and Capt Van Vhit, and Dr Goulding<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02136003"/>
make it quite interesting for Cooke<lb/>
and myself -- although we manage<lb/>
to beat them quite often, just<lb/>
think here it is the middle of Oct.<lb/>
and we are still swimming, fishing<lb/>
and the like-</p>
<p>The Sedgwick arrived yesterday<lb/>
and brought- Capt and Mrs Clarke<lb/>
and Mrs Walton, Mrs C is from<lb/>
Macon Ga and apparently a<lb/>
charming lady about 36 years to<lb/>
her credit. I was quite glad to<lb/>
welcome them back-</p>
<p>Mrs Walton is a new york<lb/>
Girl about 24 and very handsome<lb/>
and attractive, she was a Miss<lb/>
Ingrahm- Walon is Reg Armyy but<lb/>
is attached to &ldquo;<unclear>F</unclear>&rdquo; Co, during the absence<lb/>
of our own 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Lieut. One Billy Rayburn</p>
<pb n="4" id="f02136004"/>
<p>I suppose you received<lb/>
Helen Cragin's engagement<lb/>
cards, I really am glad<lb/>
to see that at last they<lb/>
are going to be married<lb/>
and trust that I never<lb/>
will have to wait as long<lb/>
for my love who ever she is<lb/>
at present the last girl I<lb/>
hear from therefore constantly<lb/>
changing from the New England<lb/>
States, as far south as Georgia<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02136005"/>
drifting westward to Mo. and<lb/>
some times switching way down<lb/>
to the isle of Cuba, Do<lb/>
you know where Cuba is-<lb/>
I have heard of it but<lb/>
I dont know exactly where<lb/>
it stands on the map -- to<lb/>
continue after wondering<lb/>
off on such a subject, I say<lb/>
I hope I shant have to<lb/>
wait that long for my Mrs R.</p>
<p>Here is a bit of news for<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02136006"/>
you. Hunter and Miss Gooding<lb/>
have announced their engagement<lb/>
and are to be married this<lb/>
winter right here in this post<lb/>
so we are going to have a<lb/>
little excitement.</p>
<p>Mother I have asked you<lb/>
a lot of questions, and shall try and<lb/>
quit it in the future but. I am<lb/>
tired of sleeping on a Government bunk<lb/>
as my feet always stick out about<lb/>
6 inches.</p>
<p>What will a bed like the one<lb/>
you had in the Company room<lb/>
cost me, or better do you want to sell<lb/>
me that one, now please let me<lb/>
hear from you soon &amp; dont fail to<lb/>
answer this question, Tell dad to see<lb/>
about my bike, I wrote Mr Meyers<lb/>
all particulars</p>
<p>With best love for all</p>

<salute>I am your devoted son</salute>
