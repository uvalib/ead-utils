PROVISIONAL GOVERNOR'S<lb/>
OFFICE<lb/>
21 FEB.- 1908<lb/>
RECEIVED<lb/>
REPUBLIC OF CUBA<lb/>
-----<lb/>
UNDER THE PROVISIONAL ADMINISTRATION<lb/>
OF THE UNITED STATES<lb/>
----<lb/>
ADVISER TO THE SANITARY DEPARTMENT<lb/>
OFFICE.<lb/>
<dateline>
Havana, Cuba, <date value="1908-02-20">Feb. 20, 1908,</date>
</dateline>
The Provisional Governor,<lb/>
The Palace.<lb/>
<salute>Sir:-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I desire to ask your consideration of the following facts<lb/>
with reference to the yellow fever situation in the Island.</p>
<p>The difficulties of the situation are discussed at some length<lb/>
in my report to the Provisional Governor, in pages 455 to 459 of<lb/>
his published Report, which it is hoped General Barry will read.<lb/>
An additional difficulty in this work, which is not mentioned<lb/>
there, is the indifference of Cubans to this disease, which they<lb/>
regard as a foe to foreigners only, and their consequent and nat-<lb/>
ural opposition to thorough and troublesome operations to combat<lb/>
it.</p>
<p>This disease has appeared at nine separate points since the<lb/>
first of January. In the corresponding period of last year only<lb/>
one case occurred. The question of whether the disease can be<lb/>
extinguished in the Island, which is of so much importance to its<lb/>
material prosperity, will be decided during the next two months.<lb/>
It seems obvious therefore that the Provisional Government should<lb/>
make every effort at the present time, both to carry out with en-<lb/>
ergy and thoroughness the special measures directed against this<lb/>
disease, and to perfect the organization of the National Sanitary<lb/>
Department in each municipality.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06224002"/>
<p>P.G.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>2/20/08.</p>
<p>In both directions the Sanitary Department can be greatly<lb/>
assisted by the services of regular Medical Officers. Of the<lb/>
three Medical Officers now on duty with the Sanitary Department,<lb/>
one is stationed at Santiago de Cuba, another at Cienfuegos and<lb/>
the third is not available for service outside of Havana, both<lb/>
because he is in charge of the Purchasing Division which is spend-<lb/>
ing large sums for mules, carts, harness and other sanitary equip-<lb/>
ment, and also because he has the military duty of Attending Sur-<lb/>
geon in Havana.</p>
<p>I request therefore the detail of another Medical Officer for<lb/>
duty with the National Sanitary Department. Whether this Officer<lb/>
can be spared from the Army of Cuban Pacification or must be sent<lb/>
from the United States is not a matter for me to decide; but it is<lb/>
suggested that if the latter is necessary, an Officer be detailed<lb/>
from the Army of Cuban Pacification and replaced from the United<lb/>
States, in order to avoid delay.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very respectfully,</salute>
<signed>J. R. Kean<lb/>
Adviser to Sanitary Department</signed>.
