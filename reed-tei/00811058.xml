<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am glad to have your <add>letter</add> of November 20. I am going to read my<lb/>
paper on the mechanism of relapse in malaria at the Johns Hopkins Medical Society<lb/>
meeting of December 3. I have been puttering on the thing since the summer of<lb/>
1914, and, as it is in the nature of a &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; disease of childhood, I thought<lb/>
it best to publsih what I have, and get ready to stick strictly to the man's work.<lb/>
I do hope you will be back in Baltimore by that time, as I would like to see you<lb/>
and I want to have you there to make any suggestions you care to. I will try to<lb/>
get the paper in shape to send a copy of it tp you ahead of time, so you can look it<lb/>
over and have time to think of loop holes in it. Also, they are going to give a<lb/>
little dinner over there that night, and they want to have you there, if you are in<lb/>
Baltimore.</p>
<p>I am wondering what Doctor Guiteras found about yellow fever along the<lb/>
north coast of Venezuela this summer. I see by the Public Health Reports that<lb/>
yellow fever was &ldquo;present&rdquo; in Venezuela in September. I have been thinking a lot<lb/>
about those isolated cases and outbreaks of yellow fever, in which it is not possible<lb/>
for anyone -- ancient savants or young fry -- to explain the origin, or even to<lb/>
suggest it. And I believe that it would be well to study those cases with the idea<lb/>
that some of them may be Weil's Disease (Infectious Jaundice). Of course, it would<lb/>
be difficult to get the cases to study, as one usually learns of the case some weeks<lb/>
or months after it is over. But a possible line, <add>t</add>hat might throw some light on the<lb/>
question, would be to study the rats in such places, and determine whether many of<lb/>
them are infected with the spirochete of infectious jaundice. I am very anxious to<lb/>
get a chance to study the thing along some lines -- the Weil's Disease line being one<lb/>
of them.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f00811059"/>
<p>If I am not fortunate enough to have you at the meeting to criticise my idea on<lb/>
relapse in malaria, I will hope to see you during the winter. I hope you will be<lb/>
over to give some talks at the Hygienic Laboratory during the winter.</p>
<p>Really, I have nothing new about relapse in malaria, and all of the work that I<lb/>
have done has been done before; but no one followed it out, and tried to correlate<lb/>
the various bits of information in order to give a practical explanation of relapse.<lb/>
But at that, I may be all wrong.</p>

<salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute>
<signed>Eugene R. Whitmore</signed>.
