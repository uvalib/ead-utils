Do pardon my mistakes<lb/>
this time, L.<lb/>

<p>Well dearest mother, I suppose you<lb/>
can guess how pleased and happy I<lb/>
am that at last I have received my<lb/>
commission- Yes the long wait is<lb/>
all over and I am just beginning anew<lb/>
We had heard all kinds of rumors<lb/>
but they all <add>seemed</add> to be groundless, The first<lb/>
we heard came Wednesday, when we<lb/>
saw in the Army Register of the<lb/>
appointments and assignments but as<lb/>
we heard nothing more that day we<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02079002"/>
concluded that the good news would come<lb/>
in on the Saturdays boat, but it was<lb/>
better than we expected, yesterday about<lb/>
1 p.m. I was sitting in my room I<lb/>
heard Capt Harmon come in the<lb/>
office and even then I had no Idea<lb/>
what he was up to, after he had been<lb/>
there about 20 minutes he called me<lb/>
and from then for about <unclear>2</unclear> hours<lb/>
I dont remember what I <del>was</del> did<lb/>
except that I filled out all kind<lb/>
of blanks and that Lt Hamilton<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02079003"/>
signed my Oath of office. Later on in the<lb/>
afternoon I moved over to the officers quarters<lb/>
and after supper I went out to Quemados<lb/>
and saw the Starks.</p>
<p>When I got up this morning the Capt<lb/>
asked me to put on my uniform and told me<lb/>
that I might do duty here until I received my<lb/>
orders so, this morning I mounted the guard<lb/>
and am officer of the day already. So you<lb/>
see it has been quite a change for me, I<lb/>
went down town this morning and got a few things<lb/>
that I needed and have spent the rest of the day<lb/>
quietly at home, <hi>of</hi> <hi>course</hi> I have been dignified<lb/>
to beat the band I guess that's the reason I have<lb/>
had a headache.</p>
<p>Now for the future, I have been assigned<lb/>
to the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Infantry, and they are stationed in<lb/>
Cuba, so I guess its more than probable<lb/>
that I will get orders to join as soon as<lb/>
possible, so I have given up all hope<lb/>
of coming home yet awhile. If I find that<lb/>
I will be able to come home. I will let you<lb/>
know in ample time, so if you dont hear you<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02079004"/>
can mark my visit off your list, of<lb/>
course I am sorry but not at all<lb/>
unhappy that is for the present-<lb/>
I am glad to say that Hunter<lb/>
was assigned to the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> it will<lb/>
make it real nice for us both.<lb/>
Saw <unclear>Beilce Barden</unclear> this morning<lb/>
he is looking fine. by the way<lb/>
Sophia Stuart is up at the Summit<lb/>
have you seen her, Lt B said he<lb/>
was trying to persuade Mrs. Barden<lb/>
to go up there for a month or so,<lb/>
Until you hear from me address<lb/>
your letters to Santa Clara Batty and<lb/>
if I have left they will be forwarded<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02079005"/>
to me,</p>
<p>Ask father if he will select<lb/>
and send to me a good <hi>sword</hi><lb/>
and send it to me <add>here at Santa Clara Batty,</add> tell him to<lb/>
get a good one to cost just about<lb/>
what he said it would and address<lb/>
it in care of the <del>Q</del> transport service<lb/>
at New York and that I will send<lb/>
him the cash for it. If he can't get<lb/>
one in Washington to order it from<lb/>
Henry V. Allien &amp; Co, 734 Broadway, N.Y.<lb/>
well dearest I will close, but will write<lb/>
you again Sunday. Best love for all<lb/>
and hoping <hi>I will</hi> be able to come home<lb/>
if only for ten days or so I am your AffSon</p>
