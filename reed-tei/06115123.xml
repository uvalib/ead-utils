<salute>My dear Miss Wood:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am sending you, at long last, Miss Reed's manuscript and I am<lb/>
taking a chance on you, because Blossom has left it up to me as to whether<lb/>
to send it to you. Apparently I &ldquo;sold&rdquo; myself to her rather over-effectively<lb/>
and she thinks I am &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo;! She feels that what I have written about<lb/>
her father has been done for love and she says that what others are writing<lb/>
about him is done for money. But of course that isn't entirely true. No<lb/>
writer gets enough from a book to make it worthwhile and certainly yours<lb/>
is largely a labor of love. She is leaving it to me to decide whether to<lb/>
send you the manuscript and you will remember that my main concern about<lb/>
it is that I came by it rather left-handedly, getting it not directly from<lb/>
Blossom but from Kellogg. However, Blossom knows that I have a copy and<lb/>
is willing to let me have it. Her main concern is that we shall not <hi>quote</hi><lb/>
from it and I can understand her viewpoint. She is still trying to sell<lb/>
it. Of course, some of the letters have been published already and those<lb/>
which have been published you can quote, giving the source other than<lb/>
Blossom's manuscript. I am sending it to you with the understanding, there-<lb/>
fore, that you will merely use it as background information and to check<lb/>
the whereabouts of General Reed.</p>
<p>I am not surprised that she has been unable to sell it in the form<lb/>
that she submitted it, as the letters are so personal that they are at times<lb/>
a little &ldquo;sticky&rdquo;! Poor Walter would probably turn over in his grave if<lb/>
he knew his daughter was trying to sell those letters.</p>
<p>There are a number of obvious mistakes in the letters--an occasional<lb/>
wrong date, and a few other items that I haven't been able to get corrections<lb/>
for. Notice in one spot he mentions sailing down the coast of Florida viewing<lb/>
the scenery from twenty miles off shore! He must have had exceptional eyesight.<lb/>
Please return the manuscript to me at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>I am sorry not to have acknowledge the receipt of the other material.<lb/>
I have had a most hectic two months. I just completed a course of fifty six<lb/>
lectures to fifty doctors sent here by the American College of Physicians.<lb/>
Fifteen or sixteen of the lectures were given by myself and I was chairman of<lb/>
practically all of the discussions.</p>
<p>Please remember me to your good husband and best wishes for the early<lb/>
completion of your manuscript.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
