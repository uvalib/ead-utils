<salute>My Dear Little Daughter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Both of your letters came last night. I too<lb/>
am <hi>very</hi> sorry. <del><unclear>I</unclear></del> the more so that I feel sure that the<lb/>
decision is erroneous, <add><del><unclear>Now</unclear></del> This is <hi>really</hi> a cause of congratulation.</add> My suggestion would be (1) to<lb/>
do what H. proposes or (2) to see the Ex'g Board in Balt.<lb/>
&amp; find out whether the alleged disability is tem-<lb/>
porary or permanent, &amp; if the former see if he can't<lb/>
apply again. I sh'd think that there would be no af-<lb/>
fection to telling <hi>him</hi> the nature of the disabil-<lb/>
ity. Our Boards do, &amp; the navy Boards also, at<lb/>
least sometimes</p>
<p>Possibly his plan is better - I rather think it is,<lb/>
I can think if only <hi>2</hi> things which could have<lb/>
disqualified him (1) under weight due to<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00811037"/>
C1<lb/>
B22<lb/>
2<lb/>
his recent sickness &amp;(2) albuminuria<lb/>
or the history of Albuminuria. The<lb/>
1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> is clearly temporary- He is usually full<lb/>
<unclear>weight,</unclear> even under very spare diet. For the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi><lb/>
Thayer's certificate, given some time ago, ought to<lb/>
clear the matter up. Thayer is <add>or was</add> a Consultant to a<lb/>
member of the Army Ex'g Boards, &amp; told me<lb/>
that his advice was frequently asked or doubt-<lb/>
ful cases &amp; (as I understood) accepted. It could<lb/>
get another Certif. from Thayer I presume if he<lb/>
(T.) is in this country. I heard that he had gone to<lb/>
Russia. Homman &amp; Fulcher would proba-<lb/>
bly do as well in that case. He. was free from<lb/>
Albuminuria a short while ago &amp;, I under-<lb/>
stood, was told that he was <add>free from it</add> by the examin-<lb/>
er in Baltimore. I am <hi>very</hi> sorry for him.<lb/>
Of<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00811038"/>
3<lb/>
Of course if he <hi>is</hi> disqualified he<lb/>
should not go.- but I don't think that he is,</p>
<p>I don't know what to say of the Br. or Canadian, plan. The<lb/>
last sentence above is true, independent of <hi>my</hi><lb/>
opinion of his fitness.</p>
<p>Send me (1) package litte envelopes - prefera-<lb/>
bly penalty (2) <unclear>''</unclear> <hi>smallest</hi> sick long envelopes<lb/>
not addressed:</p>
<p>I go to Quantico this afternoon- I returned<lb/>
there from Monday night. There is considera-<lb/>
ble of <unclear>Mal. work</unclear> to be done <unclear>there</unclear> &amp; <del>It</del> some<lb/>
typhoid prevention for which I take Waller<lb/>
&amp; Crohurst. I believe I have done some<lb/>
good- to &ldquo;help win the war&rdquo;- here &amp; that<lb/>
we can do more at Q. If we can save the<lb/>
lives of <hi>3</hi> soldiers &amp; marines-it will pay &amp;<lb/>
with a saving of considerable disability <unclear>from</unclear><lb/>
sickness as an extra credit. I think we<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00811039"/>

4<lb/>
will do more than that &amp; I am glad. My <unclear>being</unclear><lb/>
able to hold Va. only <unclear>LeP.</unclear> <add>or</add> myself could do so-<lb/>
release <unclear>LeP.</unclear> for work about the Western<lb/>
Camps- worth I Judge- 100 lives <add>at least</add> &amp; much<lb/>
disability- That is better than going with<lb/>
Guiteras. I am <hi>inclined to think</hi><lb/>
that Wrightson will be assigned to Quantico<lb/>
I suggested <add>it <hi>strongly</hi></add> but did not ask it,</p>
<p>No quarters at Q. &amp; My Address will be<lb/>
after today- <hi>&ldquo;Princess Anne Hotel- Fred-<lb/>
ericksburg Va&rdquo; -</hi> going up every morning &amp; get-<lb/>
ting back (6.20) every afternoon. What is<lb/>
the address of Sally Carter's father?</p>
<p>I am getting another rattan suitcase for<lb/>
my clothes I have more than I <del>want</del><add>have room</add><lb/>
for- Judge that I will have to get a Campaign<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00811040"/>
5<lb/>
<unclear>hat,</unclear> &amp; possibly a new pair of Khaki riding<lb/>
trousers- If I need them I will get them from<lb/>
Young. Expect to be in Norfolk- or in<lb/>
that vicinity- within 7 to 10 days. One thing<lb/>
that has held me back was that I did not<lb/>
want to go wading in the swamps with a<lb/>
Col's insignia. At Q, I have, Theodore Hayne;<lb/>
<unclear>Snidow</unclear> &amp; <unclear>clive</unclear> of Va state Board: &amp; will<lb/>
have Griffitts if I need him &amp; Waller &amp; Crohurst<lb/>
so I can <del>lel</del> leave that out, except where<lb/>
necessary to demonstrate something.</p>
<p>I agree with what you say about Washington<lb/>
&amp; will I think be able to visit it with you later<lb/>
Oh. my Dear: I hate things to fall on you.<lb/>
Not that you are not enduring- wisely &amp;<lb/>
bravely enduring- but you haven't the in-<lb/>
sensitiveness- which comes with old age<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00811041"/>

<unclear>w'h</unclear> is physical I Judge &amp; &ldquo;used to it.&rdquo; We,<lb/>
you especially, have had a &ldquo;hard row<lb/>
to hoe.&rdquo; <del>Never thele</del> And although we are both<lb/>
constitutionally better filled for doing than<lb/>
for bearing things yet please God we have<lb/>
both borne all that was put on us &amp; <hi>done</hi><lb/>
a good part of all that we could in addition.</p>
<p>Glad am I, however, of Brown's report as to your<lb/>
internal &ldquo;geography&rdquo; &amp; I hope the functional<lb/>
part will follow suit we have helped already in<lb/>
this way &amp; may do as much as Joe Hayden yet a good<lb/>
part of my work is<lb/>
due to your help</p>
<p>I must stop now other letters<lb/>
Give my dear love to your mother &amp;<lb/>
to Mary &amp; Henry &amp; Ned. What of Sylvia?</p>
<p>I don't write very often because I am saving my<lb/>
self. One day, Monday, I was up from 6. to <del>11.</del><add>10.30</add>P.M<lb/>
<del>in</del> &amp; was not hurt by it (at Q.) but I lie down<lb/>
<hi>some</hi> of <hi>every</hi> <unclear>day.-</unclear> less than <add>was necessary</add> at Norfolk. I am<lb/>
not so strong as I was before the grippe- but seem to be <hi>steadily</hi><lb/>
gaining</p>
