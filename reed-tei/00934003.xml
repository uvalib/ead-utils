Dr. Philip Alexander Bruce,<lb/>
University of Virginia, Va.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Bruce:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Both of your notes received, and I have put off answering you<lb/>
until Sunday as I am too busy during the week.</p>
<p>1/ I am willing to admit--ir, indeed, assert--that I, myself;<lb/>
LePrince and others did all we could--and on the whole good work--<lb/>
in the assistance of Gorgas in the sanitation of the Isthmus. It<lb/>
was primarily <hi>his</hi> job, however.</p>
<p>2/ You have, I think, misunderstood this part of my note. Un-<lb/>
questionably, our work in Panama--and, indeed, all work for the elimi-<lb/>
nation of yellow fever since--has been based on Reed's discovery.<lb/>
We received from him not a "cue, but a <hi>foundation</hi> for work. What I<lb/>
said was that my research work &ldquo;had determined the direction&rdquo; of<lb/>
Reed's--gave <hi>him his</hi> &ldquo;cue&rdquo; so to speak.</p>
<p>Few scientific discoveries--medical or otherwise--are in their<lb/>
entirety the work of any one man: He who puts the capstone on the<lb/>
completed structure gets--as he should--the credit for it, but the<lb/>
foundation and walls may--and generally--have been built by many<lb/>
hands.</p>
<p>Reed, for instance, had the knowledge of the discovery by Ross<lb/>
of the conveyance of malaria from man to man by the Anopheles mos-<lb/>
quito: Of Bignami's demonstration that a period of 8 to 10 days was<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00934004"/>
was<lb/>
2.<lb/>
required for the developement of the malaria parasite in this mos-<lb/>
quito--prior to the end of which time after becoming infected she<lb/>
was not capable of conveying infection: Of my demonstration that &ldquo;when<lb/>
a case of yellow fever developes in a clean, but infectable environ-<lb/>
ment, the environment becomes infected at once--within a few hours--<lb/>
but does not become infective--that is, capable of infecting other men--<lb/>
for a considerable period&rdquo;--which I afterwards fixed as &ldquo;minimally some-<lb/>
what in excess of 10 days.&rdquo; The analogy between Bignami's findings and<lb/>
mine led first Lazear: then Reed: then Durham and Walter Meyer inde-<lb/>
pendently to the same deduction: That the mechanism of conveyance of<lb/>
these two diseases--malaria and yellow fever--was the same.</p>
<p>I say &ldquo;independently&rdquo; because I have no reason to believe that<lb/>
Reed had discussed the matter with Lazear before he <add><unclear>to me</unclear></add> formulated this<lb/>
opinion, which was on the Fourth of July 1900, when we took breakfast<lb/>
together at Quemados.</p>
<p>Reed came to Cuba purposing 1/ To investigate the role of the Sana-<lb/>
relli bacillus and, if this were found negative, 2. to investigate the<lb/>
intestinal flora in yellow fever. The direction of his investigations<lb/>
was changed, as he stated, by the consideration of my data. He had<lb/>
received no directions as to the nature of the research after investi-<lb/>
gating the Sanarelli bacillus, but suggestions from General Sternberg<lb/>
were as above and negatived the conveyance by a living host. He quoted<lb/>
Sternberg as saying: &ldquo;conveyance of yellow fever by fomites is univer-<lb/>
sally admitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does this make the matter plain? I certainly have not meant to<lb/>
imply that Reed's discovery was not the basis of the yellow fever<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00934005"/>
yellow fever<lb/>
3.<lb/>
work in Panama. It unquestionably was.</p>
