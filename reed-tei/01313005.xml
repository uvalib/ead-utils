<p>rejoicing on being barefoot &amp; shows his feet with<lb/>
great pride. Tell <unclear>Mary</unclear> he takes almost as much<lb/>
pride in a - most miserably - stuffed crane <add>(<unclear>or Egret</unclear>)</add> - known<lb/>
as &ldquo;<unclear>Guk</unclear>&rdquo; (&ldquo;duck&rdquo; I suppose) - as Henry did in the stuffed<lb/>
Mallard duck in San Francisco. He <unclear>feeds</unclear> it, talks<lb/>
to it &amp; smoothes its feathers the wrong way for<lb/>
hours at a time. He is a ridiculous child, but I <del><unclear>if</unclear></del><add>sup-</add><lb/>
pose all children are if one watches them closely.<lb/>
I was very sorry to hear of Kate <unclear>Fontaine's</unclear> death. I<lb/>
thought a great deal of her &amp; the loss to her poor chil-<lb/>
dren is well nigh <unclear>iremediable</unclear>. What is the matter<lb/>
with the Beaver Dam House, that Diphtheria &amp;<lb/>
Typhoid Fever should originate there? Those disea-<lb/>
ses should be rare in the low countries.</p>
<p>afternoon</p>
<p>I have just brought the children back from the<lb/>
wreck of the <unclear>Burgenseen:</unclear> it being the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>, &amp; probably the<lb/>
last, chance they have to see it. We brought off an<lb/>
old <unclear>fashioned <hi>hour-glass</hi></unclear>, the first I have ever seen,<lb/>
as a memento. Also a red streamer of bunting for<lb/>
a pennant for Henry &amp; some <unclear>plaited rope yarn for a mat</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01313006"/>
for Laura &amp; a <unclear>buchenswood</unclear> stool for Ned. So we feel<lb/>
quite like wreckers &amp; pirates.</p>
<p>I heard from my Fla man &amp; he says nearly half of<lb/>
the trees set out in Feb. were killed by the freeze &amp; drought<lb/>
combined- that is a less number than I had feared but<lb/>
alas is was the budded half that suffered &amp; those are<lb/>
the most valuable. The older trees were not hurt<lb/>
This place is not so bad by any means as ship Island<lb/>
or as last year. It is quiet &amp; isolated but I am<lb/>
but little, <hi>if at all</hi>, more isolated than I was at San Fran-<lb/>
cisco. &amp; while I led a very active life in Cairo. I never saw<lb/>
anyone <unclear>save</unclear> as a matter of business. The climate just<lb/>
now <unclear>isn't bad &amp; we</unclear> are not at present <unclear>troubled</unclear> with<lb/>
any insects <unclear>save roaches</unclear> which are in abun-<lb/>
dance or rather super abundance, &amp; the little &ldquo;German&rdquo;<lb/>
roaches bite. not severely <unclear>but,</unclear> bite <unclear>Eddy so as</unclear><lb/>
to make a <unclear>sore</unclear> place. Of course we are going to have<lb/>
<hi>heat</hi>. <hi>mosquitoes</hi> &amp; <hi>sand flies</hi>- the most <unclear>pestiferous</unclear> <unclear>insects</unclear> in ex-<lb/>
istence - &amp; have them in <unclear>excess</unclear>: but we don't have them all<lb/>
the time here &amp; there was little good about S. Island</p>
<p>I can't help congratulating <unclear>Ed, on</unclear> his escape from his<lb/>
Mother in law. I am sure she will not venture a <unclear>cross<lb/>
alone</unclear> &amp; I suppose <unclear>E.</unclear> has &ldquo;influence&rdquo; enough to be kept <unclear>W</unclear> of the<lb/>
Missouri, <del><unclear>until</unclear></del> In all <unclear>seriousness</unclear> however it is <unclear>infin-<lb/>
itely</unclear> best that <hi>no one</hi>, however discrete, kind etc, be with them<lb/>
for 18 months at <unclear>least.</unclear></p>
