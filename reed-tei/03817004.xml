<salute>My dear Walter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I felt very flattered to have you and June come to the luncheon<lb/>
as my guests. It gave me a sense of confidence to have at least some of my<lb/>
own friends present.</p>
<p>I haven't forgotten my promise to get you a photograph of Kissinger<lb/>
autographed.</p>
<p>You were kind enough to say that you were going to propose to<lb/>
Hoeber that he might publish my talk. I <del><unclear></unclear></del><add>didn</add>'t have time to tell you that<lb/>
I have been in a quandry as to what to do with this material. I sent a<lb/>
manuscript something like this to Siegerist and told him I didn't know<lb/>
whether it should be published as an article or whether I should save all<lb/>
my material and publish it as a monograph. He strongly suggested that I<lb/>
use it as a monograph, and I don't know whether he was trying to let me<lb/>
down easily and not take the manuscript or not. Young Hoeber was here a<lb/>
month or so ago and I discussed briefly with him this monograph, but he<lb/>
didn't show the slightest interest in it even though I told him of the new<lb/>
discoveries we had made regarding Lazear and others, and of our rediscovery<lb/>
of Camp Lazear. Nevertheless, I let you have the manuscript as I was<lb/>
interested to see what reaction <hi>you</hi> might receive, and I should appreciate<lb/>
it if you would let me know in confidence his reaction to it. They might<lb/>
shy away from the commercial angle but you will remember that the manuscript<lb/>
that I gave you does not once mention the Wyeth people. It merely once or<lb/>
twice mentions Mr. Law and his colleagues and the title of the paper would<lb/>
be of course only as given, mentioning only Mr. Cornwall. Whatever happens<lb/>
I certainly appreciate your interest in the manuscript.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
