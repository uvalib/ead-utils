<p>Carter feels that there is no danger to the coast from any yellow fever east of the Peruvian mountains due to distance, population size, and a paucity of water storage.</p>

Assistant Secretary,<lb/>

<salute>Dear Miss Read:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In answer to your letter of March 30th., enclosing excerpts<lb/>
from Hanson's letter of March 1st. and March 2nd., I would say that<lb/>
I don't know where the Chanchamayo Valley is, nor do I know whether the<lb/>
Central Railroad of which he speaks is the one that goes up from Mollendo<lb/>
to Cuzco, well to the east of the Cordillera, or the extension of the<lb/>
old Aroyo Railroad from Lima. I think the latter; <unclear><add>am sure of it.</add></unclear></p>
<p>If <add>in this valley</add>, as is true of, I think, all of Peru east of the Andes (except<lb/>
possibly on the Amazon) the population is small, scattered quite station-<lb/>
ary and with so much rain that it is not necessary to do much stowing of<lb/>
water, unquestionably yellow fever would last but a little while in any<lb/>
district of this region<unclear>--</unclear>i. e. would eliminate itself spontaneously by<lb/>
failure of the human host. Nevertheless, knowing nothing of the Chan-<lb/>
chamayo region or the ease and frequency of communication <unclear>therefrom</unclear> to<lb/>
the infectable parts of the Coast, I really have not data enough on which<lb/>
<add><unclear>to have</unclear></add> definite advice. <del><unclear></unclear></del> My impression--it is only an impression, of course--<lb/>
is that there is extremely little chance of yellow fever crossing to<lb/>
the Coast from a focus east of the Cordillera:</p>
<p>1/ Because such a focus, if at all close to the Cordillera, would<lb/>
last but a short time, and</p>
<p>2/ Because of the infrequency of communication and the time consum-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00929002"/>
consum-<lb/>
2.<lb/>
ed in going across. We have no evidence that it has ever done so--indeed,<lb/>
are quite sure that it has not. I should think<unclear>.</unclear> too, that from Lima south<lb/>
would be little liable to infection after--say--May 1st. of this year. It<lb/>
is improbable that yellow fever <del>succeeding in crossing</del><add>existing across</add> the Andes would last--<lb/>
say--from February 1st.--which probably would be the date of any that Hanson<lb/>
had heard of--to next October.</p>
<p>However, I would suggest that if Chanchamayo is readily accessible<lb/>
to Dr. Hanson, that he make further inquiries from as close as he can get<lb/>
by railroad and if, in his judgment, it seems advisable--a personal investi-<lb/>
gation.</p>
<p>Frankly, I do not believe this to be necessary, but you are finish-<lb/>
ing up a rather important job on the West Coast and I would feel like taking<lb/>
Hanson's opinion on the matter as to its advisibility.</p>
<p>It is fair to repeat that we know of no cases in which yellow fever<lb/>
has crossed the Cordillera and, although means of communication are much<lb/>
better than they used to be, yet the winter season is almost on us and also<lb/>
I profoundly doubt whether there is, or has been, any yellow fever in this<lb/>
section.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
