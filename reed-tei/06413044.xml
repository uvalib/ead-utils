<salute>Dear Col. Hench-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> is<lb/>
here. You inclosed one written on Feb 20<lb/>
also and stated you had held that one in<lb/>
order to inclose a letter from Lambert. You<lb/>
<hi>failed to inclose</hi> it however.</p>
<p>I am glad you rec'd the express package<del>.</del><lb/>
I was somewhat worried because you<lb/>
had not acknowledged receipt of the package<lb/>
and you failed to answer my air mail<lb/>
letter of Mch. 3 telling you I had sent the<lb/>
package by express. That letter sums up<lb/>
my opinion on the important things we<lb/>
discussed and also some remarks <unclear>on</unclear><lb/>
the Ambulance picture of Reed at Camp<lb/>
Lazear. I think I have identified most<lb/>
of the men in the picture. I wish you<lb/>
would write to Dr Frost at once to see<lb/>
if you can't locate Mrs. Jernegan. I<lb/>
gave you his address in the typed answers.</p>
<p>If you did not get that letter I will<lb/>
send you my retained copy. I would<lb/>
like brief comment on the things in that<lb/>
letter. It won't take longer and I might<lb/>
be able to dig up more info. before<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06413045"/>
Ac<lb/>
T<lb/>
2<lb/>
I go East.</p>
<p>I will be able to look over the<lb/>
printed copies of the microfilms if you<lb/>
send them promptly. I expect to leave here<lb/>
May 8.</p>
<p>I know you will have plenty of<lb/>
comments on my answers to your 3<lb/>
questionnaires. So when you write them,<lb/>
leave space after each paragraph and<lb/>
I will write in my <del>answers.</del><add>comment.</add> That is<lb/>
easier for me than getting a stenographer<lb/>
for I can't dictate long at a time<lb/>
because they all work so late <add>in town</add> and by<lb/>
the time they get here it is nearly my dinner<lb/>
time. I don't work on yf after dark. That<lb/>
is the time the mosquitoes might pester me<lb/>
you know. I am anxious to make any-<lb/>
thing clear that you find questionable- Of<lb/>
course that is going to be a big job for you<lb/>
and it will have to wait until you<lb/>
have time to do it.</p>
<p>I am inclosing two newspaper clippings<lb/>
of interest. The one about Dr. Mazzuri<lb/>
shows another new <del><unclear>man</unclear></del><add>hero(deceased)</add> who is trying to<lb/>
&ldquo;Climb Aboard the Band Wagon (Reed's) after the<lb/>
battle is over&rdquo;- I never met Mazzuri but he<lb/>
was at Camp Columbia in <hi>1901</hi>- It is possible that<lb/>
he did assist Ames in the Huts. Possibly he is<lb/>
the man Lambert took for Pinto- It is<lb/>
important to find out <hi>when he arrived</hi> at<lb/>
Camp Columbia. He was <hi>not</hi> there before<lb/>
Nov. 30, 1900, when I left there- He was a<lb/>
Capt. of Vols. see Gen Wood's report for 1901-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06413046"/>

Thanks for the Thumb-nail sketches by<lb/>
Dr Frost. They are fine but Dr-<lb/>
Durham has <unclear>swallowed</unclear> Hammeter's report<lb/>
on Carroll completely. He also quotes<lb/>
extensively from any book, but does<lb/>
not refer to it- Dr. Frost quotes, too,<lb/>
but gives me credit.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate in finding<lb/>
something <add>good</add> on Dr-Echeveria in Dr<lb/>
Victor Vaughan &ldquo;Memories of a Doctor&rdquo;<lb/>
p <unclear>350</unclear>- You had better read that whole<lb/>
chapter and also the next one on the<lb/>
Typhoid Commission before you write<lb/>
your book. Dr Vaughan was another of<lb/>
my very fine friends- We had near by <unclear>desks</unclear><lb/>
in the S. Q. O in the Division of Sanitation in<lb/>
World War I- I think I told you of the above in 1943.</p>
<p>Referring to Jernegan again I believe<lb/>
he is the man in the Ambulance picture.<lb/>
If so then 16 in the Det. picture <hi>is not</hi> Jernegan<lb/>
and so it is important to investigate further.<lb/>
Jernegan was a larger man than Lawrence (16)<lb/>
Mrs Stark might recognize Jernegan in the<lb/>
Ambulance picture. The Starks knew him well.<lb/>
Mrs Jernegan, if not living, had <del><unclear>rare</unclear></del> a son<lb/>
that Dr Frost knew. On p. 15, Thumbnail Sketches,<lb/>
Dr. Davison speaks of him. Get after<lb/>
this, it is important.</p>
<p>Nothing yet from Mrs Gilhus. I will see<lb/>
her soon.</p>

<p>I would like to see Dr <unclear>Beverly</unclear> &amp; Lambert's<lb/>
