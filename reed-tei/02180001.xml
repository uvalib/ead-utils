FROM GEN. J. R. KEAN<lb/>
Synopsis of Instructions relative to Revenue Funds of Cuba and Official Checks<lb/>
of Disbursing Officers.<lb/>
Any revenues of the Island of Cuba advanced to disbursing officers must be deposited immediately to their<lb/>
respective credits with the designated Depositary nearest or most convenient, except-<lb/>
(1.) Any disbursing officer stationed at a place remote from such depositary, may, when authorized by the<lb/>
Division Commander, keep at his own risk such money as may be entrusted to him for disbursement.<lb/>
(2.) Any disbursing officer receiving money upon specific estimates may disburse it in accordance therewith,<lb/>
without placing it in a depositary, provided the payments are due.<lb/>
Each official check drawn by a disbursing officer must state the object or purpose to which the funds are to be<lb/>
applied.<lb/>
Such statements may be made in brief from but must clearly indicate the object of the expenditure, i.e: &ldquo;Pay-<lb/>
roll,&rdquo; adding the place: &ldquo;on contract for construction,&rdquo; naming the work for which the payment is made, etc.<lb/>
Checks will not be returned to the drawer after their payment, but the depositary shall furnish the officer with<lb/>
a monthly statement of his account.<lb/>
No allowance will be made to any disbursing officer for expenses charged for collecting money on checks.<lb/>
If a disbursing officer dies, resigns, or is relieved, checks previously drawn by him will be paid from the funds<lb/>
to his credit, unless such checks have been drawn more than four months before their presentation, or fraud is<lb/>
suspected.<lb/>
Every disbursing officer when opening his first account will furnish the depositary on whom checks are drawn,<lb/>
with his official signature duly verified by some officer whose signature is known to the depositary.<lb/>
Any official check drawn by a disbursing officer must be in favor of the party by name to whom the payment is<lb/>
to be made, and payable to &ldquo;order&rdquo; or &ldquo;bearer&rdquo; except in the following cases:<lb/>
(1) To make payment of amounts not exceeding $20.00.<lb/>
(2) To make payment at a distance from the depositary, and for the satisfaction of pay-rolls; in either of which<lb/>
case the disbursing officer may draw his check in favor of himself for such amount as may be necessary, but, as far as<lb/>
possible these checks should be made to cover the exact amount of the payment in each case.<lb/>
This receipt to be issued in duplicate, one copy to be sent to the party making the deposit, and the other to be<lb/>
sent to the party whose account is to receive the credit.<lb/>
