Charlottesville, Virginia<lb/>
<salute>My dear Ach:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you very much for the Charlottesville clippings. It is a<lb/>
good thing that I said the right thing at Charlottesville, because later<lb/>
when we visited General and Mrs. Reed in Washington, Mrs. Walter Reed and<lb/>
Blossom in Blue Ridge Summit, and General Kean, we found that every one had<lb/>
already received from friends clippings of the affair. Fortunately, they<lb/>
seemed quite pleased with the clippings and gave me to understand that they<lb/>
were satisfied and pleased with the way I am using their material and that<lb/>
I am giving credit to whom credit is due.</p>
<p>Two members of the Reed family asked me for additional copies of a<lb/>
Richmond paper which I did not have. They wanted to send them to other rela-<lb/>
tives of the Reed family. I am not going to bother you and I hate to bother<lb/>
Mr. Wranek but he will probably know what paper they refer to. The clipping<lb/>
had been cut out and the name of the paper was not thereon and therefore, I<lb/>
am writing to Mr. Wranek and asking for a few copies and also the name of the<lb/>
paper.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I think a note about you to the LaFayette alumnus is<lb/>
over due. You are too modest to send it in yourself, unfortunately. That<lb/>
is why the alumni notes are so scarce. I would like to do it and I should<lb/>
like to mention your recent election to the Ravens and that your course was<lb/>
recently voted the most popular. As I am not quite sure of the significance<del>c</del><lb/>
of the Ravens, please help me out. I know that it is one of the highest<lb/>
honors, if not the highest honor, which the University can bestow on one of<lb/>
its students or faculty. Please give me an additional sentence or two which<lb/>
I will send in.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
