<salute>My dear Sis,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I received a letter from Kit, this morning, &amp; also<lb/>
a short note from yourself - Surely Kit is &ldquo;beside<lb/>
himself&rdquo; from the manner in which he writes. His wrath<lb/>
is like the Eruption from some mighty volcano<del>e</del>. And what<lb/>
amuses me, he sends me letters in which <add>he</add> breathes wrath<lb/>
&amp; threatenings against all mankind, evidently showing<lb/>
himself to be in <del>the</del> a state of the highest excitement &amp;<lb/>
anger, &amp; at the same <add>time</add> urging me to be calm &amp; get out of the<lb/>
matter <del>people</del><add>peaceably</add> - He might, at least show me an example of<lb/>
calmness, and not be writing to me as if he considered<lb/>
me a <hi>nieve babe</hi> - Why, great Heavens! he regrets that<lb/>
he cannot be in New York to look after my affairs!<lb/>
Well, if he carried on in my presence, as he does<lb/>
in his writing, I am of the opinion that a separa-<lb/>
tion of a few hundred miles is decidedly to my<lb/>
benefit - Mark what I say: I know that Kit means<lb/>
to assist me all he can, thinks that his advice is<lb/>
good, &amp; would do anything he could to help me out of<lb/>
my difficulties, but he certainly does not know<lb/>
how to hold his temper. I am bad enough; Kit is<lb/>
worse. If it had not been for my hot head &amp;<lb/>
his hot head, I never should have <del><add>never</add></del> been in<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fLvaa0020"/>
the trouble. We both of us plunged into the suit,<lb/>
like 2 mad bulls, without considering for one<lb/>
moment what would be the termination. I was smarting<lb/>
under the slander which had been <del>uttl</del> uttered against<lb/>
me by an ignorant Dutchman; slander which could<lb/>
not have &amp; did not do me any possible damage-<lb/>
charges which no one ever believed &amp; of which<lb/>
I was immediately cleared upon an investigation.<lb/>
No, into it I would go - what did I know about the<lb/>
law? Kit said it was a good case -- another<lb/>
hot-headed Virginian said the same, and like 3<lb/>
blind jack-asses, as we were, we took aim &amp; fired<lb/>
our little thunder-bolt, which, at first, went &ldquo;whiz-<lb/>
zing&rdquo; through the air <del>A t</del><add>Straight</add> at the unfortunate<lb/>
dutchman, &amp; when we were congratulating ourselves<lb/>
that he would soon &ldquo;squeel&rdquo; from the effect of a<lb/>
smart blow, lo! behold, the thunderbolt changed<lb/>
its course, &amp; in spite of all the laws of gravity,<lb/>
described a circle and took me plumb on the<lb/>
head, making the sparks fly out, in the shape of<lb/>
dollars. The whole thing is simply ridiculous, and<lb/>
I wouldn't take $500 dollars for it. It has learned<lb/>
me a lesson that I shall never <add>forget</add> &amp; one which will<lb/>
be of immense benefit to me. I am entirely<lb/>
too impulsive - You can depend upon it, I will<lb/>
next time, think before I leap - I know <add>Kit</add> is worried,<lb/>
but what good will that effect? He seems to be afraid<lb/>
that my money is going into the large pockets of &ldquo;that<lb/>
<hi>dog</hi> Mattern,&rdquo; (as he dubs him) - Well he won't get enough<lb/>
to buy his old lady a dress - He is entitled to what he<lb/>
gets because he has purjured himself &amp; he will<lb/>
need something to keep his spirits up - If he will tell<lb/>

<del>Office of the Sanitary Superintendent,<lb/>
No. 66 Court Street<lb/>
Brooklyn, 187</del><lb/>
as many lies as he has told for $50, I consider that he<lb/>
does his work remarkably <hi>cheap</hi> - The time is coming<lb/>
when he would gladly pay that amt. to have <del>that</del> his<lb/>
lies blotted out. It is a gratification to know that<lb/>
my action has been perfectly honorable since I com-<lb/>
menced the suit - I have been deceived by <add>some</add> men to<lb/>
a slight extent, but <del>has not</del> it has not damaged<lb/>
me in the least. In fact, I never was happier, or<lb/>
more calm &amp; contented. As for my doing anything<lb/>
&ldquo;rash&rdquo;, never you fear that. I have a tolerably evenly<lb/>
balanced head on my shoulders - &amp; it was never<lb/>
<del>was</del> better balanced than it is to-day - It has been<lb/>
recently shaken &amp; clarified. Kit talks about men<lb/>
&ldquo;eating me up&rdquo; - &ldquo;sucking my life's blood&rdquo; - &ldquo;sapping&rdquo; me <del>&ldquo;</del> -<lb/>
&ldquo;picking&rdquo; me, and a lot of terrible accidents - He forgets<lb/>
that I am a medical man &amp; have seen some <hi>blood</hi><lb/>
in my day - The man who tries to &ldquo;eat me up,&rdquo; will<lb/>
find a <hi>rather</hi> tough morsel - I must give Kit credit<lb/>
for writing letters that would frighten the &ldquo;wax&rdquo;<lb/>
out of a fellow! I thought Mattern was prepa-<lb/>
ring to hurl the Egyptian plagues at me. Let me<lb/>
enumerate a few of his words -- &ldquo;They will <hi>pick</hi> you&rdquo; - &ldquo;suck<lb/>
the blood out you&rdquo;-&ldquo;Pryor is a grabber&rdquo; - &ldquo;he is a farce&rdquo; - &ldquo;Segur is<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="fLvaa0040"/>
an archangel of treachery&rdquo; - &ldquo;a liar&rdquo; - &ldquo;a scoundrel&rdquo;-&ldquo;desertion&rdquo;-&ldquo;you will<lb/>
be skinned&rdquo;-and then after telling me that I am the &ldquo;Victim<lb/>
of Malicious men,&rdquo; he throws off the <hi>mild</hi> sentence:<lb/>
&ldquo;As for D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Segur, if I were a <hi>special</hi> messenger, commis-<lb/>
sioned by God Almighty to search the vocabulary of<lb/>
Hell, I could not find language sufficiently strong<lb/>
to portray his damnable rascality&rdquo; - How is that for<lb/>
laying it on &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; - I want Kit to read this and ask<lb/>
himself whether such language is at all refrigerating.<lb/>
I am sorry that he has written anything to Logan.<lb/>
It cannot possibly do any good &amp; it may do me<lb/>
much harm - For goodness sake, let him send<lb/>
me all his extra fire and brimstone &amp; not<lb/>
to other people. I am afraid Kit's visit has not<lb/>
been very pleasant thus far - well, let everything<lb/>
go smoothly now. I am out of my trouble &amp; there<lb/>
is no use of Kit &ldquo;ripping&rdquo; around (as I know he<lb/>
does) like a little black bull stung in the <del>St n</del><add>Stern</add><lb/>
by a hornet! Upon my soul, as I write, I am<lb/>
roaring with laughter - I only wish I could see<lb/>
Kit for about half an hour; we would have some<lb/>
jolly good fun - But I must close, Excuse all<lb/>
mistakes, as I have written in a great hurry,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Love to all,<lb/>
Your affectionate Bro.</salute>
