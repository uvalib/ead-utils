<salute>My darling Sister:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your dear<lb/>
letter of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Inst, came<lb/>
yesterday afternoon, so that I<lb/>
am not losing much time in<lb/>
answering it- What long and<lb/>
interesting letters you always<lb/>
write! I am willing to agree<lb/>
with you that our dear father<lb/>
is, in many respects, a remar-<lb/>
-kable man and, in all respects,<lb/>
a pure &amp; true man, but I think<lb/>
that his oldest daughter is<lb/>
really a more <hi>remarkable<lb/>
man</hi> than he is! Indeed, when<lb/>
I think of you, as the head and<lb/>
manager of a family of <hi>four</hi><lb/>
sons &amp; <hi>five</hi> daughters, and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f13927002"/>
that you exhibit such cheerful-<lb/>
ness and contentment, in the<lb/>
midst of adverse circumstances,<lb/>
I simply remove my hat and<lb/>
say, &ldquo;there is the most wonder-<lb/>
ful woman of the age&rdquo;! And I<lb/>
mean what I say! I must tell<lb/>
you, my dear Sister, that it has<lb/>
been a great grief to me and<lb/>
a continual &ldquo;thorn in the flesh&rdquo;,<lb/>
that I have been unable, through<lb/>
no fault of mine, to assist either<lb/>
you or poor, dear Tom, in a<lb/>
financial way- It is true that<lb/>
I did manage to let Kit &amp; Tom<lb/>
have about <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>600.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi>, but that was<lb/>
in the days before your widow-<lb/>
hood. I have often wondered<lb/>
whether you didn't sometimes<lb/>
think hard of your youngest<lb/>
brother for not coming to your<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f13927003"/>
assistance- I hope not- at least,<lb/>
not very often- If I only had<lb/>
the <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>3500.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> that I lost in Florida,<lb/>
in the orange adventure!-I know<lb/>
that I told you all about that-<lb/>
Now, at Emily's urgent request,<lb/>
I am buying land for a home<lb/>
in Maryland- Am paying<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>60.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> a month &amp; have been doing<lb/>
so since November 1890; &amp; when<lb/>
I think that this must continue<lb/>
till July 1894, I feel like al-<lb/>
most &ldquo;giving up the ghost&rdquo;- with<lb/>
the boy at school, the monthly<lb/>
payments to be made <add>aforesaid</add>, Life In-<lb/>
surance to be kept up, &amp; house-<lb/>
hold expenses to be attended<lb/>
to, I feel sometimes that I<lb/>
shall have to <hi>desert</hi> &amp; skip off<lb/>
to the South Sea Islands!</p>
<pb n="4" id="f13927004"/>
<p>I merely mention these things, so<lb/>
that you can see how your<lb/>
little brother has to &ldquo;scratch&rdquo; to<lb/>
make the &ldquo;two ends meet&rdquo;- Now,<lb/>
don't misunderstand me, my<lb/>
darling Sister- I don't mean<lb/>
to say that <hi>you</hi> think unkindly<lb/>
of your brother for his lack of<lb/>
assistance- I wouldn't say this<lb/>
for the world - but that your<lb/>
brother blames himself very<lb/>
often for not doing what is<lb/>
nevertheless next to impossible<lb/>
for him to do! Nevertheless, he<lb/>
hopes that the time will come<lb/>
when he can do more, or rather<lb/>
something, &amp; then he will respond,<lb/>
oh! so gladly! I am very glad<lb/>
that little Bessie has had the<lb/>
operation performed- Carry out<lb/>
D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shield's direction strictly-<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f13927005"/>
Am sorry that your boys<lb/>
were disappointed in not hav-<lb/>
ing their salaries increased, this<lb/>
year- still they shouldn't be<lb/>
disappointed- Let them hold<lb/>
on bravely- It will certainly<lb/>
come- I am so glad that<lb/>
you have them so near you<lb/>
so that they have a mother's<lb/>
influence. Take my advice,<lb/>
my darling, &amp; let <del>them</del> all of<lb/>
of your boys get positions<lb/>
in Richmond, if possible-<lb/>
I am so glad to hear that<lb/>
Nita likes her new sphere<lb/>
of duty- She is a brave girl-<lb/>
Give her much love for<lb/>
me, when you next write<lb/>
to her- Lallie must have<lb/>
had a very severe attack<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f13927006"/>
of Typhoid fever- She is wise<lb/>
in not trying to do anything<lb/>
in the way of brain work,<lb/>
for the present- By hastening<lb/>
slowly, she will come around<lb/>
alright and can have, at least,<lb/>
the satisfaction of knowing that<lb/>
her chances of having a second<lb/>
attack are infinitesimal!<lb/>
Give her much love for<lb/>
me. Am glad to know that<lb/>
Tom's boy is taking hold of<lb/>
his books- How his dear Papa<lb/>
did despise them, when a boy!<lb/>
I trust that he will not<lb/>
inherit the same disposition.<lb/>
Give him my love and a kiss.<lb/>
So Olin is getting a &ldquo;power<lb/>
of larning&rdquo; in his head? Why<lb/>
don't you make a professor<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f13927007"/>
of him? Don't he take kindly<lb/>
to the ancient Sanskrit? I<lb/>
think that with Sanskrit, Greek,<lb/>
Latin, and a few of the modern<lb/>
languages thrown in, he might<lb/>
succeed in teaching &ldquo;the young idea&rdquo; &amp;c<lb/>
Keep the little girls at home until<lb/>
they are eight or nine, &amp; then<lb/>
&ldquo;hump 'em&rdquo; up. Little Emily<lb/>
who will be <hi>nine</hi>, next July,<lb/>
is just beginning to spell. She<lb/>
is a big, strong girl &amp; is study-<lb/>
ing very well &amp; learning to write,<lb/>
too. Lawrence is still at R. M.<lb/>
A, but I don't think that<lb/>
he will go back, next ses-<lb/>
sion- Firstly, it's a long way<lb/>
off, and Secondly, the Principal<lb/>
has seen fit to interrupt<lb/>
the boys' studies by introdu-<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f13927008"/>
cing a good, old fashioned<lb/>
Methodist revival- Of course,<lb/>
the little fellow has &ldquo;professed,&rdquo;<lb/>
as might be expected of any<lb/>
emotional boy, although, of course,<lb/>
such spasmodic religious excite=<lb/>
ment is a good deal like pouring<lb/>
water on a duck's back. I don't<lb/>
approve of such things for children,<lb/>
my darling Sister. My boy hasn't<lb/>
done anything that he should be told<lb/>
that he is a lost since &amp; in danger<lb/>
of hell-fire- He is loving, truth-<lb/>
ful, charitable &amp; tender-hearted- He<lb/>
loves God &amp; would share his last<lb/>
crust with the hungry- I could not<lb/>
help writing a sharp letter to<lb/>
D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith- as I had already told<lb/>
him my ideas of the injury which<lb/>
religious emotional excitement often<lb/>
did to young boys &amp; girls- But I must<lb/>
close- Emily &amp; daughter join me in much<lb/>
love to all- Please write soon-<lb/>
very soon, for I so love to hear from<lb/>
you-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Ever, your affectionate brother,</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
