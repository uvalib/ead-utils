<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am delighted to have your letter of<lb/>
May sixth and of course I have been intensely<lb/>
interested in all that you have written and in the<lb/>
photographs which you have sent. I am very sorry<lb/>
to hear that Kahler has had to have an appendectomy,<lb/>
but it is good to know that he is well and has<lb/>
returned hom. Give him my regards and tell him<lb/>
that we have had all the sickness from him that we're<lb/>
going to take.</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more you<lb/>
write about it, the more I am inclined to believe that<lb/>
if Moran comes for the dedication that we should<lb/>
also have Kisinger, and I think we can bear that<lb/>
expense if you are contributing Moran's expense.<lb/>
You do not mention this in your letter but I<lb/>
suppose that later you will let me know what his<lb/>
reaction was to this possibility.</p>
<p>I appreciate your inquiry concerning<lb/>
Mrs. Lazear's address. I do not have it and never<lb/>
have had it, but I have intended to start the search<lb/>
for it. Your inquiry spurred me on and I have now<lb/>
written to Doctor Parran, to Johns Hopkins Medical<lb/>
School, and to one of the Lazear family in Pittsburgh<lb/>
in the hope that I might find out where she is.<lb/>
If I get anything on it I will let you know right<lb/>
away.</p>
<p>I will think more about the question of<lb/>
what can be done for Moran if he comes. At first thought,<lb/>
I am a little bit afraid of the matter of an honorary<lb/>
degree. An honorary Master's Degree doesn't amount to<lb/>
anything anyway and I just question whether the honorary<lb/>
degree of any kind would be justified or appropriate.<lb/>
I will be glad to talk it over with the trustees and<lb/>
see what their reaction is. I do think that Moran and<lb/>
Kisinger, if he comes, should be very markedly recognized<lb/>
somewhere in the program, but I am not sure that the<lb/>

Doctor Philip S. Hench<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
May 14, 1940<lb/>
honorary degree would be approved. As I say, I will<lb/>
keep studying this matter and I will keep in touch with<lb/>
you on this matter.</p>
<p>Give my love to Mary. I hope you were a<lb/>
great help to her on the arduous duties of this trip!</p>
