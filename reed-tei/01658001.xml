<p>When<lb/>
I recur to my recent visit<lb/>
to Meherrin's Classic Village,<lb/>
I say, &ldquo;how slowly the<lb/>
time drags its weary length<lb/>
along&rdquo;: but when I think<lb/>
of the little that I have ac-<lb/>
complished during the past<lb/>
10 days, I am inclined<lb/>
to exclaim, &ldquo;how quickly<lb/>
the Present glides into the<lb/>
Past&rdquo;- Did I not know bet-<lb/>
ter, I should say that<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01658002"/>
at the least, one <hi>month</hi> has<lb/>
elapsed, since the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of this<lb/>
month. How often have I<lb/>
wished that I had postponed<lb/>
my visit till later! Not that<lb/>
I could ever expect to have a<lb/>
more enjoyable one, nor would<lb/>
I have <del>my</del> the events of my visit<lb/>
changed one iota; but the<lb/>
pleasure of anticipation,<lb/>
how sweet it was! Each<lb/>
morning to awake &amp; know that<lb/>
ere long I <add>should</add> awake in the<lb/>
ldquo;Hotel de Spencer&rdquo;! And that<lb/>
I should soon sit by your<lb/>
darling side &amp; look into<lb/>
your sweet, pretty face!<lb/>
But now, all is passed! no<lb/>
more comfortable rocking-<lb/>
chairs! No more <hi>fires</hi> to<lb/>
keep alive! Many, many days<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01658003"/>
will elapse, before I shall<lb/>
hear a certain little angel<lb/>
exclaim, &ldquo;Dr Reed, I believe<lb/>
you would sit here &amp; allow<lb/>
the fire to go entirely out!<lb/>
<hi>You</hi> don't know how to make<lb/>
a fire&rdquo;! etc. etc. And then<lb/>
those buggy-rides &amp; their<lb/>
accompanying <hi>quarrels</hi>, &amp;<lb/>
your desire to return your<lb/>
engagement ring, etc- All<lb/>
are gone, and I am left<lb/>
<hi>so</hi> lonely! But never mind<lb/>
my own precious love, we'll<lb/>
not quarrel again; will we?<lb/>
We will only look back<lb/>
&amp; smile at these, as innocent<lb/>
recreations of the past- And<lb/>
I will strive to cast aside<lb/>
the feelings of solitude<lb/>
that sometimes oppress<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01658004"/>
me, &amp; only dream of the hap-<lb/>
py time that is coming, &amp;<lb/>
which each day brings<lb/>
nearer-! Why just to think<lb/>
that one twenty-fourth (1/24) of<lb/>
that time has already gone<lb/>
by since I was in Murfrees-<lb/>
boro! And only 23/24 remain!<lb/>
Is this not enough to make<lb/>
care &amp; melancholy seek<lb/>
hasty flight? Ah! my darling,<lb/>
my love, my Emilie, you will<lb/>
soon, soon be mine, never-<lb/>
more to leave me! Oh! can I<lb/>
not for this, endure all things!<lb/>
And during the time that intervenes,<lb/>
can I not strive, will I not<lb/>
labor, to improve my talents,<lb/>
&amp; make myself in some<lb/>
slight degree worthy of you,<lb/>
my own darling! That I will<lb/>
so strive, I call Heaven to attest!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01658005"/>
And now, my little Angel, I'm<lb/>
going to tell you, how I have<lb/>
spent the time, since I last<lb/>
wrote. First, I went to New<lb/>
York town, to have an inter-<lb/>
view with General Cuyler.<lb/>
Unfortunately, I did not find<lb/>
him at &ldquo;Army Headquarters&rdquo;,<lb/>
so that I left the City, no wiser<lb/>
than when I arrived. I'm going<lb/>
to town again, this week, &amp; hope<lb/>
to learn something definitely<lb/>
of my future movements.<lb/>
Friday morning, I accepted<lb/>
an invitation from Lieut.<lb/>
Symons to take a drive<lb/>
with him. The day was one<lb/>
of the loveliest in all my<lb/>
recollection -- not a cloud ap-<lb/>
peared above the horizon<lb/>
to hide the exquisite blue-<lb/>
the sun was bath<add>e</add>ing all<lb/>
things in a flood of mellow<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01658006"/>
light, till the autumnal foliage<lb/>
looked all golden- When we<lb/>
left the Post, it was our in-<lb/>
tention to go 3 or 4 miles &amp;<lb/>
return in time for lunch,<lb/>
but so enchanted &amp; enraptured<lb/>
were we, both, with the beau-<lb/>
tiful scenery which, at every<lb/>
turn of our way, burst upon<lb/>
our view, that we could not<lb/>
resist the influence which<lb/>
was about us, and on &amp; on<lb/>
we went, kissing the gentle<lb/>
zephyrs that blew over us,<lb/>
till we were more than 12<lb/>
miles from our home- Ar-<lb/>
riving at the town of Heamp-<lb/>
stead, we alighted, &amp; while<lb/>
the good steed, that had<lb/>
brought us so faithfully on<lb/>
our journey, was reting &amp;<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01658007"/>
taking his noon-time meal,<lb/>
we also did likewise - After<lb/>
lunch, <hi>curiosity</hi> prompted<lb/>
us to walk around the various<lb/>
streets &amp; to take a glance at<lb/>
any charming nymphs that<lb/>
might be seen - We saw but<lb/>
few, &amp; these could not, truth-<lb/>
fully, be styled &ldquo;Fairies&rdquo;-<lb/>
At 3 o'clock, we were again<lb/>
on our journey &amp;, after a de-<lb/>
lightful ride of two hours,<lb/>
reached home in good time<lb/>
to enjoy a hearty dinner- And<lb/>
more than satisfied with<lb/>
our<del>s</del> day's excursion. In-<lb/>
deed, the day was spent most<lb/>
pleasantly- The forests never<lb/>
appeared <add>in</add> more gorgeous<lb/>
array- with colors as<lb/>
rich &amp; variegated as the<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01658008"/>
evening tints of a western<lb/>
sky. The trip lacked but one<lb/>
thing- Had the State been N.C.<lb/>
instead of <hi>N.Y</hi>, &amp; had <hi>you</hi>, my<lb/>
own love, supplied the place<lb/>
of my companion, nothing would<lb/>
have been lacking to make<lb/>
my joy complete.</p>
<p>Slightly changing the subject, I<lb/>
desire to ask a favor- On my<lb/>
return from the South, I found<lb/>
that the order, granting my leave<lb/>
of absence, had been sent to<lb/>
Murfreesboro. Will you have<lb/>
some one inquire at the P.O.<lb/>
&amp; if it is there, will you kindly<lb/>
forward it,? <del>as</del> I desire to file<lb/>
it with my official papers.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to Mrs. H. &amp; your<lb/>
mother, &amp; also to Miss Annie V. when<lb/>
you next write to her- Adieu! my own Sweet<lb/>
Emilie-</p>
