Dr. H. R. Carter,<lb/>
2122 California Street, N. W.,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I read your &ldquo;History of Yellow Fever,&rdquo; being<lb/>
the first half of Section III, in two major and three minor<lb/>
sittings. I intended to read it at my leisure and take per-<lb/>
haps several weeks to it, but finished it in a few days for<lb/>
two reasons, (1) because I found it so interesting and (2)<lb/>
because I feared that some untoward accident might happen to<lb/>
the precious manuscript. I am therefore sending it back to<lb/>
you by registered mail, carefully packed and sealed. I want<lb/>
to say that I am very glad to have had the opportunity to read<lb/>
it and appreciate the compliment implied in the fact that you<lb/>
entrusted it to me. I wish we had more epidemiological stud-<lb/>
ies done as thoughtfully and carefully. I am amazed at the<lb/>
erudition, the work, the feat of memory and the impelling power<lb/>
of logic which pervades the whole treatise.</p>
<p>As I read along, I made notes of whatever popped<lb/>
into my head, and you will find them on slips of paper which I<lb/>
have left between the leaves. Sometimes I made a comment which<lb/>
you afterwards answered satisfactorily, but I left the comment<lb/>
anyhow. You will note that I have no paper interleagued after<lb/>
about the middle, because I felt entirely incompetent to pass<lb/>
a judgment on Mayan gibberish. I take off my hat to any man who<lb/>
is able not only to quote it in the original, but actually to<lb/>
discuss its translation and probable meaning of words and sym-<lb/>
bols. You show an extraordinary knowledge of history and geo-<lb/>
graphy - I found myself in the position of a man running after<lb/>
a train to catch up with you. I cannot help thinking that if<lb/>
you had not been a great epidemiologist you would have been a<lb/>
great historian. You bid fair to be both. I do not see where<lb/>
you got the time and patience to read all those original records<lb/>
and understand what they were about and to tell them with such<lb/>
charm and good humor. The logic is irresistable and your con-<lb/>
clusions must be accepted - there is no getting away from that.</p>

<p>Dr. H. R. Carter.</p>
<p>October 29, 1924.</p>
<p>I wonder whether you would care to say something more<lb/>
about the possible Asiatic origin of yellow fever. My under-<lb/>
standing is that Stegomyia mosquitoes are very prevalent in<lb/>
the Philippines, China and the Hawaiian Islands, and that<lb/>
this represents infectable territory. It has doubtless never<lb/>
been infected, for these areas would very likely have become<lb/>
permanent endemic foci. This is a phase of the subject any-<lb/>
how with reference to the practical point, especially in view<lb/>
of the possibility of carrying the infection to these parts.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
am best to La-u-ra<lb/>
