<salute>My dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>What I feel<lb/>
most inclined to write you is<lb/>
of my distress that you should<lb/>
have had this grievous setback,<lb/>
but of that I am sure you al-<lb/>
ready know what I want to<lb/>
say, and know it much better than<lb/>
I could put it in any bungling<lb/>
attempt to actually say it. I do<lb/>
want to say, though, that with<lb/>
all my heart I hope it will<lb/>
prove to be less of a set-back<lb/>
than you anticipate, and quite<lb/>
aside from my wishes I am sure<lb/>
there is good ground to believe<lb/>
that it will be so -- and of one<lb/>
thing I am quite certain, that<lb/>
of all people you are the<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01227005"/>
best prepared to make the best of it by virtue<lb/>
of your philosophy and your daughter.</p>
<p>I have fortunately had the better part of<lb/>
a full day that I could devote to your<lb/>
manuscript of the &ldquo;African&rdquo; section for the<lb/>
first reading; and if I had not had the<lb/>
day free I should probably have taken it<lb/>
anyway, once I got into the manuscript,<lb/>
for I found it even more fascinating, if<lb/>
possible than the American section. Quite<lb/>
aside from the epidemiological argument<lb/>
it is a liberal education in a chapter of<lb/>
history that was quite new to me. as it<lb/>
must be to most people, and the story,<lb/>
as you have told it, has all the flavor<lb/>
of the old original narratives, and one<lb/>
gets from it a good thrill of the romance<lb/>
-- pretty grim romance to be sure of the<lb/>
voyages and high adventures themselves.</p>
<p>Coming to the epidemiological argument,<lb/>
I like the way in which you first bring<lb/>
over the contrast with America in respect of<lb/>
the kind of evidence which it is possible to<lb/>
adduce for Africa -- that because of the<lb/>
lack of records and of conditions of settlement.<lb/>
negative evidence from Africa is of little or<lb/>
no significance, and that because of other<lb/>
conditions -- the relative insusceptibility of the<lb/>
negroes, and the small number of European<lb/>
introduced into the country at <add>any</add> one time<lb/>
and place, <hi>positive</hi> evidence must of necessity<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01227006"/>
be hard or impossible to get<lb/>
for the days before accurate clini-<lb/>
cal records &amp; <unclear>Reliable</unclear> differentia-<lb/>
tion of &ldquo;fevers&rdquo;. It is clear enough<lb/>
after you state it and show<lb/>
why, but very few would have<lb/>
seen it without a pointing fing-<lb/>
er as guide.</p>
<p>And I am sure that nobody<lb/>
but you would have thought of<lb/>
turning, as you have done, to the<lb/>
islands and the fleets as the<lb/>
most likely sources of evidence,<lb/>
for while it is absolutely logical<lb/>
there are not many who have<lb/>
the nose to follow a trail of<lb/>
logic so far.</p>
<p>Of the positive evidence which<lb/>
you present that taken from<lb/>
the account of Drake's expedition<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01227007"/>
takes hold of me most forci-<lb/>
bly, partly because it seems to<lb/>
me to be the most clear-cut<lb/>
and complete simple item, and<lb/>
partly because it is such an<lb/>
excellent example of what a<lb/>
good nose may pick up on an<lb/>
old trail that has already been<lb/>
run over so much. How many<lb/>
medical historians must have<lb/>
read of that voyage, and how many<lb/>
different interpretations they must<lb/>
have put upon the epidemic.<lb/>
The facts, as you present them,<lb/>
make a very strong argument for<lb/>
the diagnosis of yellow fever; and<lb/>
certainly in your discussion you<lb/>
do not overstate the conclusion.<lb/>
You state it, I think just right, and<lb/>
I believe that most unbiased<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01227008"/>
persons will get from the facts a conviction<lb/>
which is somewhat nearer to certainty than<lb/>
you (-very properly) indicate. Only one question<lb/>
occurs to me about the presentation, namely<lb/>
can typhus be so confidently excluded on the<lb/>
grounds that you give, that is, chiefly on the<lb/>
climate? I ask without pretending to much<lb/>
of either knowledge or thought on the matter,<lb/>
and because it is the only one of the &ldquo;<unclear>exclu-<lb/>
sions</unclear>&rdquo; which is not immediately and entirely<lb/>
satisfactory. And even here I don't mean to<lb/>
question your conclusion, but rather to ask<lb/>
whether it might not be buttressed by addi-<lb/>
tional reasons, as perhaps that typhus would<lb/>
have been recognized as a fever familiar at home,<lb/>
and possibly some other points which you may<lb/>
have in mind from the spread &amp; <unclear>fatality</unclear> of<lb/>
the epidemic.</p>
<p>The rest of what may be considered &ldquo;posi-<lb/>
tive&rdquo; evidence of the existence of yellow fever<lb/>
in Africa prior to 1648 is, perhaps, not very<lb/>
convincing if each item is considered separately<lb/>
and independently; but taken all together, as<lb/>
they properly should be, they make a pretty for-<lb/>
midable array of facts, all aligned to the<lb/>
same conclusion. Lined up again with the Amer-<lb/>
ican history, and with your &ldquo;biological&rdquo; argu-<lb/>
ment, they seem to me thoroughly convincing.</p>
<p>When I first read your American section<lb/>
I wondered a little why you had not<lb/>
first disposed of the African side; but now<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01227009"/>
that I've seen the whole<lb/>
story, I fully agree that the<lb/>
sequence which you have<lb/>
followed is much better.<lb/>
If one should read the African<lb/>
section first it would give the<lb/>
impression of being quite incon-<lb/>
clusive; but taken as a sequel<lb/>
to the American history it fits<lb/>
on beautifully as a capstone<lb/>
to the evidence from that side.</p>
<p>I do not know what further<lb/>
you may have planned, and<lb/>
needless to say I hope that what<lb/>
ever more you have planned<lb/>
you will have the leisure and<lb/>
the inclination to carry out. But<lb/>
in all honesty I do not see<lb/>
any real <hi>necessity</hi> for anything<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01227010"/>
more. What you have written is,<lb/>
as it stands, a complete history<lb/>
of yellow fever up to 1648, or<lb/>
one might say up to the time<lb/>
(- I don't recall just the date)<lb/>
when the infection was obviously<lb/>
implanted on both continents<lb/>
and admittedly <unclear>being</unclear> passed back<lb/>
&amp; forth between them. What is<lb/>
more you have <unclear>shown</unclear> how the<lb/>
history of yellow fever -- or indeed<lb/>
of any disease must be written,<lb/>
applying new knowledge of its<lb/>
characteristics to the interpreta-<lb/>
tion of old and obscure facts.<lb/>
I think that is perhaps the<lb/>
greatest contribution of the &ldquo;History&rdquo;.<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01227011"/>
I do not know of anything like it unless<lb/>
it be Snow's interpretation of the epidemiol-<lb/>
ogy of Cholera, which is a mate to your History<lb/>
in the Skill and logic with which the<lb/>
facts are interpreted and woven together<lb/>
into an inevitable theory; but Snow did<lb/>
not have to dig up the facts- i.e. the<lb/>
<hi>general</hi> facts for himself.</p>
<p>I can't help wishing, as anyone must<lb/>
who reads this history, that you may<lb/>
add to it a history of yellow fever in<lb/>
later years, for no one else will do it so<lb/>
will or so delightfully. But I do not think<lb/>
it is an obligation which rests upon<lb/>
you as has the writing of this <unclear>early</unclear> section--<lb/>
something which no one else <unclear>would</unclear> have<lb/>
done or could have done. With the lead<lb/>
that you have given and the source of<lb/>
information that are available a pretty<lb/>
satisfactory history of yellow fever in later<lb/>
years can be written by one who possesses<lb/>
the requisite diligence, without <unclear>necessarily</unclear><lb/>
having the <unclear>genius</unclear> which was indispensable<lb/>
in the part you have done. I hope, then,<lb/>
that you will be content to rest on this<lb/>
completed work until such time as you<lb/>
may feel inclined, without pressure, to<lb/>
take up another &ldquo;unit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that this will find you<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01227012"/>
more comfortable than you<lb/>
have been and on the road<lb/>
to further improvement. In this<lb/>
Susan joins me, as in love<lb/>
to yourself and Miss Laura, and<lb/>
all good wishes for you both<lb/>
and in looking forward to seeing<lb/>
you when you feel like having<lb/>
visitors.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>Wade H. Frost</signed>,
<seg>
P. S. I will return the M S tomorrow<lb/>
or <unclear>briefly</unclear> from any office. Have no<lb/>
envelope for it here at home.<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01227013"/>
P. S. If I may add a little to what<lb/>
I've said, it seems to me that<lb/>
when one takes the whole set of<lb/>
facts which you have presented there<lb/>
really is no escape from the <unclear>conclu-<lb/>
sion</unclear> that yellow fever was introduced<lb/>
into America after the Spanish invas-<lb/>
ion. The facts all fit in so completely<lb/>
on this hypothesis that it is al-<lb/>
most inconceivable that any <unclear>other</unclear><lb/>
would be found to fit so well-<lb/>
the less probable because the<lb/>
theory which they now fit into is<lb/>
one of such intricacy.<lb/>
It is perhaps not unlikely that<lb/>
further facts bearing upon the history<lb/>
of yellow fever in the early years<lb/>
maybe brought to light from other<lb/>
Sources not now available; but<lb/>
this does not seem to me to alter<lb/>
the <unclear>finality</unclear> of your argument &amp; con-<lb/>
clusions, for certainly new <hi>facts</hi><lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01227014"/>
cannot contradict older facts,<lb/>
and I think the facts already<lb/>
aligned are enough to make<lb/>
the conclusion a <hi>necessary</hi> one.<lb/>
