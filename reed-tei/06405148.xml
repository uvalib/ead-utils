General and Mrs. J. R. Kean<lb/>
2804 N<del>orth</del> Street, North West<lb/>
Georgetown, Washington 7, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General and Mrs. Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I just returned last night from California and the meeting of the<lb/>
American Medical Association, where I read one paper and discussed another.<lb/>
Mrs. Hench went with me and we had a wonderful time. After the week in<lb/>
San Francisco, we spent five days in Santa Barbara. I had expected to spend<lb/>
merely a couple of hours with Houston Lizear, but he and his wife were ex-<lb/>
tremely kind and courteous to us. They seemed to think that they had to<lb/>
entertain us most of our time there, so that really we did not have as much<lb/>
rest as we had hoped. Nevertheless, it was most interesting and profitable<lb/>
to meet him and his wife. I also met his sister-in-law. When I have more<lb/>
time than today, I want to tell you of the many interesting things I learned,<lb/>
particularly of the tragic attitude of Mrs. Lizear. It was a particular<lb/>
delight for me to have the privilege of telling Houston more about his father<lb/>
than he had ever known. He and his sister learned nothing, and I mean absolutely<lb/>
nothing, from his mother. The mention of there father's name was taboo, because<lb/>
of the terrible misconception which Mrs. Lizear entertained for so many years.<lb/>
Houston looks very much like his father. He is a shy, quiet, but nevertheless<lb/>
pleasant man of forty-seven, and it was a real privilege to see him shyly but<lb/>
eagerly try to find out at this late date what kind of a man his father was.<lb/>
The privilege of telling him was alone almost worth all the labor that I have<lb/>
put into this work. There is much more that I will tell you later.</p>
<p>We had a delightful time with the Trubys. We were at their home<lb/>
once for dinner, and entertained them two or three times down town. They were,<lb/>
of course, most anxious to hear about you. General Truby has a slight limp<lb/>
and weakness on the one side, but is really doing very well. He seems happy<lb/>
and fairly active. It was so nice to meet his very pleasant daughter, and,<lb/>
of course, Mrs. Truby is charming.</p>
<p>I am so glad that your maid is being cared for by Doctor Crain.<lb/>
I had not intended to give him that responsibility. That was is own idea.<lb/>
As you say, he is a very nice man, and I do hope that he can help Elizabeth.</p>
