<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you so much for the reprints of your Hygeia article, and<lb/>
particularly for the list of corrections to go with the docu-<lb/>
ment, which must have been a considerable labor to prepare.</p>
<p>As for the notebook, I'm afraid it's going to be a disappoint-<lb/>
ment to you - it's about 8x13 inches, and has stiff cardboard<lb/>
covers, so could hardly be the little one Lazear carried in his<lb/>
pocket. It makes me really livid to think that I didn't read<lb/>
more of it - I don't know the date of the last entry. As I<lb/>
believe I told you, I had planned to return and finish it the<lb/>
next day, and then was prevented by a situation which I could<lb/>
not help but which I wish I'd walked out on <del><unclear></unclear></del> anyway, now.</p>
<p>Dr. Malloch came by the notebook in the following manner - and<lb/>
he doesn't particularly want the Army Med. Lib. to know about<lb/>
it, he says: a young Negro medical student who had been work-<lb/>
ing for or at the Army ML came to him with this notebook, which<lb/>
he said was Reed's own. He said that they had been cleaning<lb/>
out the Army Library and this had been tossed out, and that he<lb/>
had rescued it from a trash can and obtained <unclear>z</unclear> permission to<lb/>
keep it. He offered it to Dr. Malloch for several hundred dol-<lb/>
lars. After a little dickering and the passage of some time,<lb/>
Dr. Malloch bought it for $25. Dr. Malloch took Dr. Russel's<lb/>
(?) word that it wasn't Reed's and lost interest in it pretty<lb/>
much, to judge from the way he spoke of it. He said it just<lb/>
contained day to day records of temperatures, urines, etc. and<lb/>
was probably kept by an orderly or by Neate or somebody else<lb/>
not very exciting.</p>
<p>I'm sending you the photostats under separate cover in the<lb/>
morning. I haven't had a minute to see or telephone General<lb/>
Kean, and am going to continue toiling over the hot typewriter<lb/>
until at least Dec. 1, so I'm in no hurry to have them back and<lb/>
you can pour over them at your leisure. I think it may turn<lb/>
out to be rather an interesting discovery, just in helping to<lb/>
piece out events as they happened; but it isn't anything that<lb/>
I can very well use. Aside from my personal satisfaction in<lb/>
having unearthed something new, I'm also very pleased to be able<lb/>
to turn it over to you for whatever use you can make of it. I'm<lb/>
not going to be able to get to New York again until January,<lb/>
probably, to finish it, so why don't you write Dr. Malloch and<lb/>
ask him about the final entries?</p>
<p>According to the notebook, incidentally, they found electrozone<lb/>
fairly effective. They took sewage and dumped electrozone in<lb/>
it, and after a few hours all the little bacilli etc. lay still.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06115054"/>
<p>I'm afraid this is all a disappointment to you if you've been<lb/>
hoping very hard for the lost pocket size notebook. The<lb/>
photostats I'm sending, inferior as they are, are at least<lb/>
life size. I'm terribly interested in the identity of the<lb/>
handwriting. Do let me know if you can make it out. And<lb/>
take your time about returning the photostats - I won't need<lb/>
them back until after the 1st.</p>
