SANITARIAN, DIES</p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>Long Illness Fatal To Assistant<lb/>
Surgeon-General Of Marine<lb/>
Hospital Service.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>BIRTHPLACE IN VIRGINIA</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Graduated From University Of<lb/>
Maryland--World Authority<lb/>
On Yellow Fever.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Washington, Sept. 14 (AP).--Dr.<lb/>
Henry R. Carter. Assistant Surgeon-<lb/>
general of the nited States Marine<lb/>
Hospital Service, died at his home here<lb/>
today after a long illness.</p>
<p>Born in Carolina county, Virginia,<lb/>
in 1852, Dr. Carter was considered one<lb/>
of the foremost medical and sanitary<lb/>
specialists in the country. He founded<lb/>
the present maritime quarantine system<lb/>
and was nominated for the Nobel prize<lb/>
in connection with his discoveries in<lb/>
connection with yellow fever work.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter is survived by two sons,<lb/>
Dr. Henry R. Carter, Jr., of Birming-<lb/>
ham, Ala.; Edw. Champ Carter, of<lb/>
Baltimore; a brother, Charles Harrison<lb/>
Carter, of Portland, Ore.; three sisters,<lb/>
Mrs. Nancy Carter Redd, of Ashland,<lb/>
Va.; Miss Mary Clayborne Carter,<lb/>
North River Plantation, Va., and Miss<lb/>
Mary C. Carter, and a daughter, Miss<lb/>
Laura A. Carter.</p>
<p>Entered Service In 1879.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter was commissioned in the<lb/>
United States Marine Hospital Service,<lb/>
now the Public Health Service, May 5,<lb/>
1879. He served as chief quarantine<lb/>
officer of Cuba from August, 1899, un-<lb/>
til August, 1900, and as chief quaran-<lb/>
tine officer of the Isthmian Canal Com-<lb/>
mission from May, 1904, until Febru-<lb/>
ary, 1905, when he became director of<lb/>
hospitals of the Isthmian Canal Com-<lb/>
mission, serving in this capacity from<lb/>
March, 1905, until September, 1909. He<lb/>
served at different times as sanitary<lb/>
supervisor to the Peruvian Government<lb/>
and as a member of the yellow fever<lb/>
council of the international health<lb/>
board of the Rockefeller Foundation<lb/>
until the time of his death.</p>
<p>He inaugurated control measures for<lb/>
malaria in the extra cantonment areas<lb/>
of army camps in malarial regions dur-<lb/>
ing the World War and was a member<lb/>
of many scientific bodies relating to<lb/>
medicine and hygiene, both American<lb/>
and foreign, including the Authors' Club<lb/>
of Great Britain. He formulated the<lb/>
doctrine of the control of the yellow<lb/>
fever bearing mosquito as the sole<lb/>
method necessary for the elimination of<lb/>
endemic centers of this disease.</p>
<p>Associate Of Gorgas And Reed.</p>
<p>He was intimately associated with<lb/>
Surgeon-General Gorgas and Dr. Walter<lb/>
Reed throughout the greater parts of<lb/>
their careers, particularly in the work,<lb/>
study and control of yellow fever. Dr.<lb/>
Carter was graduated in medicine from<lb/>
the University of Maryland and entered<lb/>
the Marine Hospital Service May 5,<lb/>
1879. In the fall of that year he saw<lb/>
his first case of yellow fever. In 1890<lb/>
Dr. Carter had proposed the disinfec-<lb/>
tion of vessels from Cuban and Mexican<lb/>
ports at the port of departure, so that<lb/>
the time en route to the port of entry<lb/>
after such disinfection could count as a<lb/>
part of the &ldquo;quarantine period&rdquo; for<lb/>
yellow fever and, by so much, lessen the<lb/>
time of the detention in quarantine.<lb/>
This plan was adopted.</p>
<p>Worked Until Death Came.</p>
<p>For many months prior to his death<lb/>
Dr. Carter had worked on a history of<lb/>
yellow fever, which took him into many<lb/>
fields of literature and history, in many<lb/>
languages, and even in many dialects.<lb/>
His one hope was to live until this was<lb/>
completed. Three days before he was<lb/>
stricken with what proved to be his last<lb/>
illness he had so far completed it that<lb/>
it can be finished by others and this<lb/>
task will be undertaken by his daughter,<lb/>
Miss Laura Carter.</p>
<p>Funeral services will be held at 10<lb/>
o'clock Wednesday morning. These<lb/>
will be first at the Westmoreland and<lb/>
later at St. Margaret's Church. Arch-<lb/>
deacon Sterling Clayborne, of Sewanee,<lb/>
Tenn., and the Rev. Dr. Smith, of St.<lb/>
Margaret's Church, will officiate. The<lb/>
body will be taken to Ashland, Va., for<lb/>
burial.</p>
