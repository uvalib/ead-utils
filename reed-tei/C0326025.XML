<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Miss Brown and I are still putting in long hours on the &ldquo;dimin-<lb/>
ishing&rdquo; bibliographic &ldquo;returns&rdquo; while I await Dr. Frost's summons to<lb/>
Baltimore. In the course of a telephone conversation with Mrs. Frost<lb/>
last Monday, she told me that Dr. Frost was in New York that day, but<lb/>
that he hoped, &ldquo;very shortly&rdquo; to be able to resume the work on the final<lb/>
editing of Father's MS.</p>
<p>In addition to the contemplated bibliographic work with Dr.<lb/>
Frost, I am extremely anxious to discuss with him the selection of the<lb/>
men to be asked to fill in <del>the</del> our outline maps, which have been ready<lb/>
and waiting this long time. I took the data on this subject over to<lb/>
the Dr. Frost last December, but he had only time to spare for the more<lb/>
pressing work on the bibliographic files before leaving Baltimore on<lb/>
&ldquo;flu&rdquo; work. He told me, however, that he felt that the matter should<lb/>
be gone over carefully before we decided which particular men should<lb/>
be approached <hi>re</hi> the filling in of these maps--I say &ldquo;men&rdquo; as we shall<lb/>
probably have to have some of the maps filled in by different authorities<lb/>
familiar with the respective eras they are to represent. As soon there-<lb/>
fore as Dr. Frost can go into this matter with, I shall <add>take</add> it up with the<lb/>
men we decide <unclear>on</unclear>, in order to have all such material ready by the time<lb/>
the MS is in shape for you.</p>
<p>Miss Brown will continue her volunteer services as long as there<lb/>
is anything left which she can do to help us. I have been to the Library<lb/>
of Congress to check up some of her findings this week--excellent work!<lb/>
I wish I could have had time to write (or you to read!) a more detailed<lb/>
account of the past year's work on the verification of our bibliography.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0326026"/>
bibliography.<lb/>
-2-</p>
<p>It hasn't seemed worth while to stress the difficulties, but--<lb/>
Sherlock Holmes' clues were a &ldquo;broad highway&rdquo; to some of the faint,<lb/>
elusive and tortuous &ldquo;trails&rdquo; which we have followed--and followed<lb/>
to their source! We could never have covered the ground had we<lb/>
worked &ldquo;Union hours,&rdquo; at which rate it would have taken about two<lb/>
years. This, of course, on account of the imperfect data we had to<lb/>
go on and the mass of material to be covered in consequence. For<lb/>
instance, my Aunt, in looking at a packed file case of 4<add>&Prime;</add>&times;6<add>&Prime;</add> bibliogra-<lb/>
phic cards, remarked: &ldquo;I suppose that sometimes one of those little<lb/>
things represents as much as three or four hours work?&rdquo; She happened,<lb/>
as she spoke, to have picked out one of our pet abominations--and<lb/>
final <unclear>triumphs</unclear>--which, I was able to assure her, represented eight<lb/>
days work, on the part of Miss Brown and a couple of hours of checking<lb/>
thereafter of my own!</p>
<p>Of course, as I wrote you long since, the quotations essential<lb/>
to the epidemiological argument of Father's MS were concentrated upon<lb/>
and verified last year but, since I have this unexpected hiatus to<lb/>
fill in it is a great satisfaction to get as good results from it as<lb/>
we are getting.</p>
<p>With best wishes and trusting that when next I write it will be<lb/>
to give you news of work in Baltimore,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
