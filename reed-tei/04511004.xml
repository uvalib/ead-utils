Mr. Frederick L. Rath, Jr., Director<lb/>
National Council for Historic Sites and Buildings<lb/>
712 Jackson Place N.W.<lb/>
Washington 6, D.C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Rath:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just returned from Cuba and am anxious to report to you and General<lb/>
Grant regarding the status of Walter Reed's little experimental building.<lb/>
It would appear that the Cubans are actually going to do something and the<lb/>
architect from the Ministry of Health gave me a copy of a blue print which<lb/>
shows what they plan to do. It is not adequate but at the moment they only<lb/>
have $25,000 alotted to the project. I am sure American help will be neces-<lb/>
sary to improve the situation. But at long last the Cubans seem to have<lb/>
broken through their 10-year inortia and I am much more hopeful that a co-<lb/>
operative effort will accomplish what I have been hoping for for so long.</p>
<p>There is another building much more valuable, concerning which two Cuban<lb/>
friends asked my advice. It is a lovely Cuban Finca, in a suburb of Havana,<lb/>
the owners of which have been collecting Cuban objets d'art for some years<lb/>
and which they wish to have preserved. They hope to give it to an appropriate<lb/>
group which will look after it but have no faith in the Cuban Government and<lb/>
do not want to have any governmental body administer it. They have asked me<lb/>
if I could find out if there is any Cuban-American association interested in<lb/>
such matters. They knew of none, although they have lived in Havana all of<lb/>
their lives. However this is a matter which is secondary to my favorite<lb/>
project.</p>
<p>I received your kind letter of January 21, forwarded to me in Havana, and I<lb/>
shall be delighted to lunch with you and General Grant; however I fear that<lb/>
I did not make myself clear in my last letter to you. I thought I had stated<lb/>
I would have an all-day meeting at Bethesda (U. S. Public Health Service)<lb/>
on Saturday, February 23 and proposed lunch either Friday, the 22nd or Sunday<lb/>
the 24, suggesting however that Sunday might be an important day of rest for<lb/>
both you and General Grant. I would appreciate it greatly if you could let<lb/>
me know whether I could see you and General Grant, preferably for lunch or<lb/>
possibly for dinner, Friday the 22nd. I must make my pullman reservations and<lb/>
hotel reservations at once. I have tentative reservations at the Mayflower.</p>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
