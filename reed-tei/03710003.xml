<salute>My dear Bayard:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Remembering your comments on my yellow fever talk, a thought<lb/>
occurred to me. Some time I should like to give that talk at the University<lb/>
of Virginia. I have an ulterior motive. As you know, I want to raise a<lb/>
few hundred dollars, perhaps a few thousand dollars, to erect a suitable<lb/>
memorial around the site of Camp Lazear. This money will naturally come<lb/>
from institutions and individuals interested in the work of Lazear, Reed<lb/>
and others. Since Reed was a Virginia man, I am hoping to eventually call<lb/>
on the University or individuals of the University for a little financial<lb/>
help, and I thought that perhaps I might sometime be invited down and give<lb/>
this talk before the faculty and students, after which I would either pass<lb/>
the hat or merely make a dignified one-sentence remark to the effect that<lb/>
any help that any individual or university would wish to give would be most<lb/>
appreciated. Would you think it proper for you to write, perhaps to the<lb/>
dean or someone else <unclear>as</unclear> if you were writing spontaneously. Tell them<lb/>
your reactions to my talk and suggest, apparently on your own, that I might<lb/>
come down there sometime and give it before the faculty and students. There<lb/>
is one hitch. Moran was there himself just before the W. and J. affair. He<lb/>
was there only for a morning. He did not see the students or speak to them,<lb/>
but there was a luncheon given to him by the medical faculty with about 18<lb/>
or 20 members present, and he spoke for about 45 minutes informally. I don't<lb/>
believe this would seriously interfere with the interest that my talk might<lb/>
have for the general faculty of the university, including the medical faculty,<lb/>
and particularly the medical students who ought to be mighty proud of the work<lb/>
of Walter Reed.</p>
