A Kiss<lb/>
for Mr<lb/>
D. Johnson.<lb/>
Don't forget<lb/>
to acknowledge<lb/>
check which<lb/>
I sent in my<lb/>
Monday's letter.<lb/>
<dateline>
Columbia Barracks,<lb/>
Quemados, Cuba,<lb/>
<date value="1900-12-04">Dec. 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1900.</date>

<salute>My precious wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your dear<lb/>
letter written on Thanks-<lb/>
giving-Day came yesterday --<lb/>
the first quick trip for<lb/>
any of your letters, since<lb/>
my return to Cuba- The mail,<lb/>
also, brought a long, sweet<lb/>
letter from precious stu-<lb/>
dent- I'll have to answer<lb/>
hers to-night- Just to think<lb/>
that this is dear Darboy's<lb/>
23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> birth-day! Well, to be<lb/>
sure, lovie, dear, between<lb/>
boys of twenty-three and<lb/>
the arrival of <hi>gout</hi>, you<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02226002"/>
and I must be getting along<lb/>
pretty well towards a ripe,<lb/>
old age! How old is that<lb/>
precious fat daughter?<lb/>
You musn't worry, however,<lb/>
about the size of that toe-<lb/>
joint, as it will slowly<lb/>
subside and resume its nor-<lb/>
mal size- You have begun to<lb/>
get out-doors earlier<lb/>
than I thought you would.<lb/>
Hurrah! for the lady who<lb/>
can go to the market and<lb/>
to Matinees! You will slowly<lb/>
get back to your pace, and<lb/>
<hi>such eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> as<lb/>
my sweet Miss Farmer-lady<lb/>
will do in order to make<lb/>
up for lost time; well I<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02226003"/>
&amp; Miss Bird-tamer will have<lb/>
to take a back-seat! wait<lb/>
until Sis Mott's <hi>Eczema</hi> and<lb/>
Sis Meadow's <hi>gout have</hi> taken<lb/>
a more favorable turn, and<lb/>
I shall have to plant <hi>two</hi><lb/>
mint-beds! He! He! Ha!! Ha!!<lb/>
Dear Me! what &ldquo;miss Know-<lb/>
-all&rdquo; lady have you been<lb/>
talking to, to work my sweet<lb/>
wifie into such a nervous<lb/>
state about our work<lb/>
here? Let them talk all<lb/>
they please, my sweetheart-<lb/>
We know what we are<lb/>
doing- The world is filled<lb/>
with people (asses) who<lb/>
don't want to know any<lb/>
thing about the propagation<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02226004"/>
of various diseases, inclu-<lb/>
ding yellow fever! They<lb/>
had rather have thousands<lb/>
sicken &amp; die of it, so <hi>they</hi><lb/>
are not affected by it!<lb/>
The Marine Hospital Service<lb/>
would gladly choke off<lb/>
our experimentation, for it<lb/>
may prove that all their<lb/>
disinfection has been<lb/>
for naught- We are fol-<lb/>
lowing along careful lines<lb/>
and believe that we are<lb/>
doing just what is right<lb/>
&amp; absolutely necessary in<lb/>
order to ascertain the<lb/>
causation of yellow fever-<lb/>
We are not doing what<lb/>
any reasonable person<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02226005"/>
should criticize us for-<lb/>
We are not compelling<lb/>
any one to subject himself<lb/>
to any danger without he<lb/>
really expresses a desire<lb/>
in writing to do so-<lb/>
My advice to my sweet<lb/>
wifie is to cease talking<lb/>
with any one about it<lb/>
and, if possible, stop think-<lb/>
ing about it- Nobody<lb/>
has suffered any harm<lb/>
from what we have done<lb/>
so far, and it may be<lb/>
that we will obtain no<lb/>
results, but, of course,<lb/>
it is much too early to<lb/>
to draw conclusions yet.<lb/>
Just let the matter drop,<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02226006"/>
dearest, out of your thoughts,<lb/>
&amp; remember <add>that no one</add> ever tried<lb/>
to do any good for the world<lb/>
&amp; the people in it, who<lb/>
escaped the harshest<lb/>
criticism from his fellow-<lb/>
man! It has always<lb/>
been thus, &amp; doubtless<lb/>
always will be. Cheer up!<lb/>
you sweet joy &amp; stop both-<lb/>
ering your darling head<lb/>
&amp; heart about these things.<lb/>
<hi>Tuesday night</hi>. I stopped here,<lb/>
this morning, and wrote a short<lb/>
letter of congratulations on his<lb/>
birth-day to Lt. Reed, of<lb/>
Cienfuegos, and, also, a short<lb/>
letter to that sweetest of<lb/>
daughters, Miss B. Reed,<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02226007"/>
formerly of Georgetown-<lb/>
Since morning, the wind has<lb/>
suddenly changed from South<lb/>
to North and has been blowing<lb/>
quite hard, which, I dare say,<lb/>
means more cold weather<lb/>
in the states- Don't let that pre-<lb/>
cious <hi>toe</hi> get <hi>chilled</hi>, lovie,<lb/>
dear, or old Mr &ldquo;<hi>Go-out</hi>&rdquo; might<lb/>
grab hold of it and throw<lb/>
you into bed again! and then<lb/>
you <hi>couldn't</hi> &ldquo;go out&rdquo;! see?<lb/>
How is the atmosphere of<lb/>
12 18 now during the cold snaps?<lb/>
Any warmer than it used<lb/>
to be? I do so much hope that<lb/>
the winter won't be a cold<lb/>
one -- and that my sweet oom-<lb/>
sey can get a chance to go<lb/>
out and take exercise in<lb/>
the bright sunlight- Goodnight,<lb/>
you sweet joys- Boo! Boo!<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02226008"/>
wednesday morning -- 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- Hoop-<lb/>
la! how are my precious<lb/>
pigs, this morning? The wind<lb/>
is blowing like sixty and<lb/>
although the temperature is<lb/>
72&deg;, it feels decidedly chilly.<lb/>
I have come very near over-<lb/>
sleeping, this morning, as<lb/>
it is now within a few min-<lb/>
utes of 7 o'clock, &amp; I think<lb/>
I hear the rattle of the mail-<lb/>
wagon, but as my envel-<lb/>
ope is already addressed<lb/>
(I do that the night before)<lb/>
it only takes a second to close<lb/>
my letter- Don't let Jack-Frost<lb/>
catch my sweet girls! Turn<lb/>
on the steam, when it gets cold!<lb/>
Love to Lucy, Mrs. D. &amp; Miss Mason<lb/>
Take care of your precious selves.<lb/>
Love &amp; kisses &amp; kisses &amp; love<lb/>
for my pretty pretty girls-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Devotedly,</salute>
<signed>Papa</signed>.
