<p>Well,<lb/>
isn't it a comfort<lb/>
to know that that wide-<lb/>
mouthed Mr Bryan is<lb/>
completely snowed un-<lb/>
der, and that even his<lb/>
own state has gone<lb/>
back on him, so that<lb/>
he can't go to the Senate!<lb/>
I'll declare that I feel<lb/>
almost like going out<lb/>
and taking a drink!<lb/>
on second thought I'll<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02173002"/>
just enjoy a quiet chuck-<lb/>
le all to myself- It didn't<lb/>
take me long to get set-<lb/>
tled down in my old<lb/>
Quarters - and I am just<lb/>
as comfortable as ever.<lb/>
I saw General Wood<lb/>
on my arrival &amp; had<lb/>
a long talk with him<lb/>
as to our future work.<lb/>
He looks splendidly and<lb/>
is taking an intense in-<lb/>
terest in the outcome<lb/>
of our further observations<lb/>
I reported to Gen. Lee<lb/>
yesterday morning and told<lb/>
him that I thought his<lb/>
going away from Cuba<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02173003"/>
was an outrage - that<lb/>
Cuba wouldn't seem<lb/>
like Cuba without him-<lb/>
He said that he <add>had</add> asked<lb/>
to be given a station<lb/>
in the U.S- that he<lb/>
felt that he had been<lb/>
here long enough -<lb/>
I am very glad to say<lb/>
that Dr &amp; Mrs. Kean will<lb/>
remain here at Colum-<lb/>
bia Barracks- Dr Kean<lb/>
prefers to stay in Cuba<lb/>
&amp; keep his majority to<lb/>
going to the U.S. &amp; becom-<lb/>
ing an ass't. Surg. with<lb/>
the rank of Captain-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02173004"/>
He will take Dr Starks<lb/>
place here; the latter<lb/>
going to Matansaz --<lb/>
I am, of course, sorry to<lb/>
see Dr &amp; Mrs. Stark go-<lb/>
but I guess they won't<lb/>
leave before January-<lb/>
You should see their two<lb/>
darling little boys- They<lb/>
are two cunning &amp; dear<lb/>
for any thing, as they sit<lb/>
side by side and wide in<lb/>
their little goat-cart.<lb/>
Mrs Kean is here with<lb/>
Martha and little &ldquo;Bobbie&rdquo;,<lb/>
a very pretty baby boy-<lb/>
I only saw her for a<lb/>
glympse this morning-<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02173005"/>
<hi>Friday night Nov. 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>- You would<lb/>
hardly believe that it <del>was<lb/>
to</del> could be so cold and chilly<lb/>
in Cuba during the early<lb/>
part of November- You must<lb/>
have had a real norther<lb/>
in the U.S- Yesterday morn-<lb/>
ing at 6.30, the temperature<lb/>
was 66&deg;- which we consider<lb/>
<hi>cold</hi>! Joking aside, I feel<lb/>
sure that this weather will<lb/>
materially reduce the cases<lb/>
of yellow fever in Havana:<lb/>
I sincerely hope so- In a<lb/>
few days our observation<lb/>
camp will be in good<lb/>
shape- We have selected<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02173006"/>
a sight about 2 miles from<lb/>
Quemados in quite an iso-<lb/>
lated spot- Dr Ames will<lb/>
be in charge of the Camp-<lb/>
Whether we will be able<lb/>
to carry out further observa-<lb/>
tions will depend upon<lb/>
our ability to get immigrants<lb/>
who are willing to under-<lb/>
take the risk of being bitten.<lb/>
I shall devote my time to<lb/>
laboratory work &amp; study<lb/>
of stained sections of the<lb/>
mosquito for the discovery,<lb/>
if possible, of the parasite-<lb/>
I'll tell you about it, as<lb/>
the work progresses-<lb/>
Don't worry about me one<lb/>
bit, for I shall take no<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02173007"/>
risks. When I got here, I<lb/>
found <hi>three</hi> darling letters<lb/>
from sweet Room - fixer, and<lb/>
<hi>two</hi> type-written letters from<lb/>
precious cocoon- I read<lb/>
them with as much interest<lb/>
as if they were new and had<lb/>
only just arrived- Little Joy's<lb/>
letters were remarkably<lb/>
well written- She is a pre-<lb/>
cious, darling child, mother,<lb/>
dear, and you must help her<lb/>
all you can with her studies,<lb/>
as I know you will-</p>
<p><hi>Saturday morning</hi> - <hi>nov. 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>- I am<lb/>
up before 7 o'clock, in order<lb/>
to add a line or two- The<lb/>
Thermometer stands at 63&deg; and<lb/>
I am <hi>almost frozen</hi>! It is<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02173008"/>
perfectly astonishing <hi>how cold</hi><lb/>
this temperature feels here, while<lb/>
in the States we wouldn't notice<lb/>
it- I do hope that all of our<lb/>
fruit trees ordered from Black<lb/>
won't freeze en route to<lb/>
Blue Ridge- Last night, I called<lb/>
on the Keans and on Gen. Baldwin-<lb/>
Mrs. Baldwin is very pleasant-<lb/>
The people here, officers and<lb/>
ladies are very much interested<lb/>
in the <hi>mosquito</hi> - <hi>theory</hi> and I<lb/>
am plied with questions right<lb/>
and left- Do pray write often<lb/>
and tell me all the news 1218-<lb/>
Did Miss Carry return? Poor<lb/>
girl, how sorry I felt for her<lb/>
that night- If you wrote on Sunday,<lb/>
your letter didn't arrive in <hi>Wednesday's</hi><lb/>
mail- But I am expecting one or<lb/>
two letters, this morning, from my precious<lb/>
children- Love &amp; kisses for my <hi>girls</hi>- Be<lb/>
good, sweet girls- Boo! Boo!</p>
