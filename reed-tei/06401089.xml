<salute>My dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>It was a real pleasure to<lb/>
get the Post card which came last<lb/>
week from you &amp; Col Hench and to<lb/>
know that you had talked for<lb/>
two days over the Episode of 1900!<lb/>
Meanwhile Mrs Laura N. Wood<lb/>
has beat you to it. Her &ldquo;Walter Reed<lb/>
Doctor in Uniform <unclear>'</unclear> Illustrated by<lb/>
Douglas Duer. Printed by Julian<lb/>
Messuer Inc New York for the<lb/>
Junior Literary Guild is in print<lb/>
and in my possession since April 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
It is intended for readers in their teens<lb/>
but is good reading for grown-ups<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06401090"/>

As I told her she has taken the more<lb/>
difficult dramatic way of uniting the<lb/>
story by having the <hi>dramatis personal</hi><lb/>
tell it by reported conversations.<lb/>
This is of course a more vivacious<lb/>
way but it involves the large<lb/>
responsibility of knowing or<lb/>
imagining the personality and<lb/>
character of each speaker.<lb/>
It begins with Reed as a boy of 13<lb/>
when his father wakes him up to tell<lb/>
him &amp; his brother that the Yankees<lb/>
are coming and to take the horses<lb/>
into the woods to hide them.<lb/>
I think she has  dug up quite a lot<lb/>
of information about his youth and<lb/>
has told the story of the yellow fever<lb/>
Demonstration clearly and well.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f06401091"/>

<p>There are errors of course but none<lb/>
I think of great importance.<lb/>
I really have not get read<del>y</del> it criti-<lb/>
cally however, as it came during<lb/>
the week of the dedication of the T.J.<lb/>
memorial when things were in rather<lb/>
a whorl here. I was given five<lb/>
books that week, four of them by the<lb/>
authors and have not yet got<lb/>
through them all. Mrs Wood says<lb/>
that the issue of her books is delay-<lb/>
ed at the bindery but that she is<lb/>
going to send you a copy and one<lb/>
to Colonel Hench as soon as she<lb/>
can get them. She pays you both<lb/>
grateful credit for your help to<lb/>
her, and you for your generosity in<lb/>

C<hi rend="subscript">2</hi><lb/>
B<hi rend="subscript">5</hi><lb/>
4<lb/>
litting her use material which you<lb/>
were using in your forth coming<lb/>
book. That in the way should now<lb/>
be making its appearance and<lb/>
I am eager to see it.</p>
<p>I suppose Hench told you all about<lb/>
his new baby and Mrs Hench's<lb/>
visit to Colorado Springs.<lb/>
He also told you doubtless of the<lb/>
troubles that all these new men had<lb/>
because they did not have any<lb/>
manual of the Medical Dept. It<lb/>
was a great piece of folly for the<lb/>
Gen. Staff to have abolished it and<lb/>
also for the General Hospitals to be<lb/>
taken a way from the direct control<lb/>
of the S.G.O. But I cannot go into that<lb/>
here and now.</p>
<p>Goodly &amp; cordial regard<lb/>
to Mrs Truby</p>
