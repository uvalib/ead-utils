<p>From a letter to Doctor W.M. Brumby</p>
<p>To produce a complete, comprehensive account such as the yel-<lb/>
low experiments in Cuba, one must know the personal experi-<lb/>
ence of many of those who took part in, or observed it.</p>
<p>The part that Doctor Finlay, whose theories were the primary<lb/>
cause of the experiments with the mosquito as the carrier are<lb/>
well known. Major Reed's work has been fully covered. The con-<lb/>
nection with the experiment of General Wood, Major Kean, the<lb/>
Surgeon General and others are also well known and, while<lb/>
very important, had little impact on the actual experiment.<lb/>
They did what any men in their positions would have done.</p>
<p>General Truby has well presented all he knew of it in the<lb/>
best book yet written about it. But he was there but a short<lb/>
time, and not at all when Camp Lazear was running, so there<lb/>
was much that he missed.</p>
<p>What were the thoughts <del><unclear>anactions</unclear></del> and actions of the decis-<lb/>
ive character in the whole experiment; the man who alone sol-<lb/>
ved the mystery, Lazear, are unknown, owing to his untimely<lb/>
death from yellow fever blood injection. They will never be<lb/>
known, as he kept no records except the mystic numbers in the<lb/>
little note-book which Major Reed was able to solve and from<lb/>
them form the basis for the experiment to prove his findings.</p>
<p>A big mistake was made when the names were presented for<lb/>
honors by Congress in 1929, was the excluding of Doctor Fin-<lb/>
lay, whose previous findings, plain as they were, had been<lb/>
unrecognized by blind doctors for 19 years, and on whose<lb/>
evidence these experiments were begun by Major Reed. Of course<lb/>
Lazear would have naturally turned to the mosquito on account<lb/>
of his experience with them in transmitting malaria, but Fin-<lb/>
lay was of great help.</p>
<p>Agramonte had to be honored as a member of the Board although<lb/>
he in no way helped the experiment and was seldom there, while<lb/>
Finlay's assistance was invaluable. I hope that when Doctor<lb/>
Hench writes his book he will see his way to emphasize Finlay's<lb/>
help. I think that the non-recognition of Finlay by the 1929<lb/>
Congress was a grave error, and is accountable for much of<lb/>
the bitterness of certain classes of the Cubans today.</p>
<p>It is too bad that Act of Congress is a closed book and that<lb/>
more deserving men, such as Finlay, Ames and Lambert cannot<lb/>
be included. Compare their invaluable services to taht of<lb/>
Hammann, Bullard, Covington, who were in the later experiments<lb/>
months after the main theory had been proven, and yet were<lb/>
honored by Congress.</p>
