<salute>My darling Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>Did it ever oc-<lb/>
cur to you, while pondering on<lb/>
the shifting moods of the &ldquo;mens<lb/>
humana,&rdquo; how quickly it changes<lb/>
from sadness to gladness, from<lb/>
darkness to sunshine? And what<lb/>
peace, serene, unspeakable, is expe-<lb/>
rienced when the cloud has bro-<lb/>
ken away! If you have thus med-<lb/>
itated, (and I doubt not that you<lb/>
have very often,) then you will<lb/>
be able to appreciate, in some<lb/>
faint degree, the varying sta-<lb/>
tus of my feelings during the<lb/>
two days just ended. <hi>Yesterday</hi>,<lb/>
my darling, all was anxiety &amp;<lb/>
suspense -- angry billows and<lb/>
darkened skies -- and had you<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01631002"/>
seen me, you would have exclaim-<lb/>
ed, &ldquo;<hi>blues</hi>, <hi>unmistably</hi>, <hi>blues</hi>&rdquo;! But<lb/>
<hi>now</hi>, how sweetly the lark sings!<lb/>
and how have the hoarse-sounding<lb/>
billows been transformed into<lb/>
<del>the</del> musical ripples, and the ten-<lb/>
ebrous sky put on its azure<lb/>
robe! and could you, at this<lb/>
time, behold me, you would say,<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi>bliss</hi>, and <hi>only bliss</hi>&rdquo;! If you will,<lb/>
imagine the happiness of some<lb/>
poor mortal, who having been<lb/>
promised a cottage, is given<lb/>
a palace &amp; servants to do his<lb/>
bidding; Or if it please thee<lb/>
more, imagine the joy of a weary,<lb/>
thirst-smitten traveller, who,<lb/>
seeing a fountain in the dis-<lb/>
tance, on approaching finds not<lb/>
only the cool, refreshing draught,<lb/>
but also a tempting banquet<lb/>
spread before his gaze: Or<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01631003"/>
yet more appropriate, imagine the<lb/>
exhultation of a lover, who<lb/>
scarcely expecting the arrival<lb/>
of <hi>one</hi> letter from his lady-<lb/>
love, receives <hi>two</hi>! Could you<lb/>
blame him for any demon-<lb/>
strations he might make, how-<lb/>
ever frantic? Surely you<lb/>
<hi>are</hi> the dearest, sweetest girl<lb/>
that ever was born <hi>in</hi> or <hi>out<lb/>
of</hi> the Old North State! The only<lb/>
wonder to me is that I have suf-<lb/>
ficiently recovered from the ef-<lb/>
fects of those dear messages<lb/>
to be able to write intelligibly.<lb/>
Indeed, I am afraid that I can't<lb/>
accomplish the latter, and, if not,<lb/>
you will know the cause.<lb/>
Pardon me, a moment, while<lb/>
I make a slight digression, and<lb/>
hurl a few thunder-bolts at<lb/>
the unworthy head of my brother<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01631004"/>
Jim. The careless fellow! who<lb/>
promised faithfully to visit<lb/>
Portsmouth within a day or<lb/>
two &amp; forward your letter, &amp; then<lb/>
neglected it till last Monday,<lb/>
while I might have pressed it<lb/>
to my heart a week earlier,<lb/>
he permitted it to lie in a<lb/>
sorry Post Office &amp;, perhaps,<lb/>
<add>to <hi>be</hi></add> tossed about by a sorrier<lb/>
<del>p</del>Post-Master! Fortunate indeed,<lb/>
it is for him that many miles<lb/>
separate us or I would make<lb/>
him rue his misconduct.<lb/>
To think of the many favors I<lb/>
have conferred upon him, &amp;<lb/>
to be thus treated. It's too bad!<lb/>
But in my joy I have forgiven<lb/>
him, &amp; must hasten to tell you<lb/>
<del>how</del> all about the reception<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01631005"/>
of your letters &amp; how I felt and<lb/>
acted. Well, to begin -- You must<lb/>
know that for the past week,<lb/>
I have proven a source of<lb/>
much amusement for homefolks<lb/>
by my promt attendan<del>g</del><add>ce</add> on the<lb/>
Post Office, &amp; coming home, each<lb/>
day, without a letter from you,<lb/>
&amp; with an elongated counte-<lb/>
nance, (it is never <hi>very</hi> short,<lb/>
which you may have observed,)<lb/>
they have had many good laughs,<lb/>
at my expense. Still, honest<lb/>
untiring effort is rarely<lb/>
or never disappointed in this<lb/>
world, &amp; so it came to pass<lb/>
in this particular instance.<lb/>
Nothing daunted (ah! observe<lb/>
<hi>my</hi> confidence!) I visited the<lb/>
office, Wednesday, &amp; to my unboun-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01631006"/>
ded delight, received <hi>two of the<lb/>
sweetest letters in all creation</hi>.<lb/>
Call me foolish, if you like, and<lb/>
laugh as heartily as you please,<lb/>
I <hi>won't</hi> retract the assertion!<lb/>
I immediately opened the one di-<lb/>
rected to Portsmouth, &amp; began<lb/>
to read it as I walked along<lb/>
the street. After reading the first<lb/>
two pages, I came to that part of<lb/>
your letter where you spoke<lb/>
of lengethened separation caus-<lb/>
ing &ldquo;indifference&rdquo; (&amp; at that I began<lb/>
to open my eyes); farther on I<lb/>
found a quotation from Virgil<lb/>
on the <hi>mutability</hi> of <hi>woman</hi>; &amp; yet<lb/>
farther I found an &ldquo;<hi>inconstant</hi><lb/>
heart&rdquo;! Said I, &ldquo;Shades of Plato!<lb/>
What <hi>does</hi> this mean? This is the<lb/>
<hi>climax</hi> of the <hi>inexplicable</hi>! Why<lb/>
does my darling girl write me<lb/>
about hearts being &ldquo;<hi>inconstant</hi>&rdquo;?<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01631007"/>
Separation causing indifference!<lb/>
When not even death itself<lb/>
could, for one moment, blot her<lb/>
from my memory! I <del>w</del>can't read<lb/>
this!&ldquo; And sure enough, I did<lb/>
not read another line, but closed<lb/>
the letter &amp; walked home, thinking<lb/>
of woman's changeableness- As soon<lb/>
as I got home, I sought my room<lb/>
&amp; a second time began its perusal;<lb/>
when lo! the very first sentence<lb/>
that my eye alighted upon was,<lb/>
&ldquo;but enough of <hi>irony</hi>&rdquo;! &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I exclaimed,<lb/>
&ldquo;Heaven bless my sweet girl for<lb/>
that word, <hi>irony</hi>.&rdquo; Never before did<lb/>
I know its full force! If <del>I</del> ever<lb/>
I loved you, 'twas at that moment.<lb/>
I had not doubted you -- I could not<lb/>
do that -- but yet I <hi>could not un-<lb/>
derstand</hi> how you could write<lb/>
to me in such a queer strain-<lb/>
But &ldquo;irony&rdquo; rolled away the cloud,<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01631008"/>
&amp; the remainder of your letter was<lb/>
sweeter to me than <del>the</del> &ldquo;honey<lb/>
&amp; the honey-comb&rdquo;- &amp; your<lb/>
second letter did but add to<lb/>
the sweetness- I endorsed all<lb/>
your words, except where you<lb/>
spoke of &ldquo;woman's heart&rdquo; as<lb/>
&ldquo;Cherishing a love deeper &amp; purer<lb/>
than is possible for Man&rdquo;- It<lb/>
may be the general rule, but, my<lb/>
precious girl, there are some excep-<lb/>
tions, &amp; you will yet know the<lb/>
significance of my words. Never<lb/>
can your love exceed mine in<lb/>
depth or purity- In my heart<del>s</del><lb/>
of hearts thou shalt ever<lb/>
nestle, &amp; there thou shall reign<lb/>
supreme, &amp; while with the battles<lb/>
of life I wrestle, <hi>to love thee<lb/>
be my constant dream--</hi><lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01631009"/>
I am very sorry that you did<lb/>
not receive a letter at the time<lb/>
expected &amp; was thus disappointed.<lb/>
I know that I promised to write<lb/>
two a week, but as I wrote<lb/>
three or four the first week<lb/>
after parting, I was afraid<lb/>
that they were pouring in<lb/>
a little oftener than was a-<lb/>
greeable- Still, as they bring<lb/>
you &ldquo;much pleasure,&rdquo; you<lb/>
shall not be deprived of<lb/>
them. I'll write twice a week<lb/>
from this time, till we next<lb/>
meet- You must not expect<lb/>
a great deal in each letter,<lb/>
and must be satisfied whether<lb/>
they are good, bad or indif-<lb/>
ferent. I'll write Mondays<lb/>
&amp; Thursdays, &amp;, on this account,<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01631010"/>
these days shall be dearer to<lb/>
me than ever before.<lb/>
I was much surprised at<lb/>
the fact that Miss B.R. knew<lb/>
anything of our engagement,<lb/>
for I don't know what was<lb/>
the source of her information.<lb/>
I am inclined to think that<lb/>
She <hi>pretended</hi> to know a great<lb/>
deal, &amp; by that means, ascertained<lb/>
what she was before igno-<lb/>
rant of. I never told &ldquo;Mr<lb/>
Kit&rdquo; a word concerning the suc-<lb/>
cess of my trip to Murfrees-<lb/>
boro. He wrote to me &amp; asked many<lb/>
questions. In reply, I used this<lb/>
expression; &ldquo;if discarded, I should<lb/>
be loth to tell you, since I<lb/>
know you would straightway<lb/>
divulge it to B.R. &amp; <hi>she</hi> to<lb/>
all Murfreesboro, &amp; I do not<lb/>
desire that the whole town<lb/>

<pb n="11" id="f01631011"/>
should be informed of the failure<lb/>
of my suit.&rdquo; You see that the<lb/>
above does not convey any<lb/>
very important information,<lb/>
&amp; what it does convey, is rather<lb/>
negative. If he wrote to Miss<lb/>
B.R. &amp; told her that we were<lb/>
engaged, he was stretching his<lb/>
imagination, &amp; the young College<lb/>
Miss, in telling others, was putting<lb/>
her fancy to its extremest<lb/>
tenuity. (I believe that she is<lb/>
capable of such things, as well<lb/>
as my brother.) I will write to<lb/>
the Westerner &amp; tell him to bridle<lb/>
his Adorable's tongue, lest she<lb/>
seek new fields for conquest-<lb/>
You might have announced<lb/>
to her that you, too, knew a<lb/>
small piece of news;- but I pre-<lb/>
sume, it was best that you did<lb/>
not- The photograph will be<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01631012"/>
taken &amp; forwarded next week, and<lb/>
I will be responsible for its<lb/>
being a much better looking<lb/>
face than the original.</p>
<p>By the way, I must tell you that<lb/>
I propose writing to your mother<lb/>
in a day or two, &amp; ask her ma-<lb/>
ternal approval of our engage-<lb/>
ment. If you have any desire to<lb/>
see what I shall write to her,<lb/>
you must make her show it to<lb/>
you. I am compelled to take<lb/>
this course, since you would<lb/>
not permit me to escort her<lb/>
to the Mineral Spring!<lb/>
My letter, I know, has grown<lb/>
tedious to you, &amp; I close it with<lb/>
the promise that the letter in rhyme<lb/>
shall be written-</p>
<closer>
<salute>I remain, always,<lb/>
Your affectionate &amp; devoted,</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>-
