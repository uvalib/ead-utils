<p>Obituary.</p>
<p>FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY</p>
<p>WALTER REED, M. D.,<lb/>
MAJOR AND SURGEON, U. S. ARMY.</p>
<p>MAJOR WALTER REED of the Medical Corps of the<lb/>
U. S. Army, died at the Army General Hospital in<lb/>
Washington, on November 23, at the age of fifty-one<lb/>
years. His death was due to appendicitis, for<lb/>
which an operation was performed on November 17.</p>
<p>Major Reed was born in Gloucester county, Va.,<lb/>
in 1851, and was a graduate of the Medical Depart-<lb/>
ment of the University of Virginia, and of Bellevue<lb/>
Hospital Medical College in 1875. He was appointed<lb/>
an Assistant Surgeon in the Army the year of his<lb/>
graduation, and at the time of his death was first<lb/>
on the list of majors in the Medical Department<lb/>
of the Army. In 1893 he was appointed Curator of<lb/>
the Army Medical Museum, in Washington. During<lb/>
the Spanish-American war he was a member of the<lb/>
board to investigate typhoid fever in the Army.</p>
<p>In 1900 he was sent to Havana and was placed at<lb/>
the head of the commission appointed to determine,<lb/>
if possible, the cause of yellow fever and the means<lb/>
by which it is spread. Starting from Finlay's<lb/>
theory of the agency of the mosquito in the dissemi-<lb/>
nation of the disease, the commission, by a series of<lb/>
painstaking experiments, demonstrated most con-<lb/>
clusively the causal relation of Stegomyia fasciata to<lb/>
yellow-fever epidemics, and disproved the theory that<lb/>
the disease could be conveyed in fomites, or that it<lb/>
was contagious in the ordinary acceptation of the<lb/>
term. Sanitary measures based upon the conclu-<lb/>
sions of Major Reed's commission have freed Havana<lb/>
from the disease.</p>
<p>Major Reed enjoyed the reputation of being a<lb/>
bacteriologist of the first rank. Upon his return<lb/>
from Cuba he was stationed at the Army Medical<lb/>
Museum as curator, a position he had occupied nine<lb/>
years before, and one for which his attainments<lb/>
eminently fitted him. He was also professor of<lb/>
bacteriology and pathology in the Army Medical<lb/>
School, and lecturer on those subjects in the Colum-<lb/>
bian Medical College of Washington.</p>
