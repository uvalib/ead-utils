<salute>My dearest Gran</salute>
</opener>
<p>I surely thought that<lb/>
I would have written to you<lb/>
before this especially as I<lb/>
am now for the present<lb/>
unattached, and theoreti-<lb/>
cally a gentleman of elegant<lb/>
leisure. But in point of<lb/>
fact there seems to be a<lb/>
lot going on. I have had<lb/>
the money accounts of<lb/>
the Yellow Fever Commission<lb/>
to straighten out, and<lb/>
Louise seems to deep in<lb/>
a lot of entertainments<lb/>
charitable fairs etc, etc.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14341002"/>

I found the family very<lb/>
well indeed but Mr. Bobs<lb/>
had succeeded in trans-<lb/>
ferring to his own fat<lb/>
little body most of the<lb/>
<unclear>adipose</unclear> which you and<lb/>
Mausy put on to Louise<lb/>
last summer &amp; fall with<lb/>
so much labor. So I at<lb/>
once put Mr. Bobs on<lb/>
three meals a day of<lb/>
Mellins food &amp; condensed<lb/>
milk, which helps her<lb/>
out considerably, and agrees<lb/>
with him perfectly.</p>
<p>I am immensely relieved<lb/>
to know that M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Cosh is<lb/>
satisfied with George's<lb/>
progress, &amp; that his temperature<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14341003"/>
3/<lb/>
have come down to normal for all day. &amp;<lb/>
I hope soon that we will be able to see him<lb/>
in Cuba. But when the reaction comes<lb/>
for Molly there is no telling what pranks<lb/>
her nerves will play her.</p>
<p>I had a very jolly trip down with <unclear>Miss</unclear> Bacon<lb/>
&amp; <unclear>Miss</unclear> Brandreth Mrs. Slocums nieces, and<lb/>
Capt. Adams, 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Art. &amp; Major Rolfe. We<lb/>
nearly froze for the first 36 hours as the<lb/>
Cabins had no heating arrangements.<lb/>
My bottle of cocktails which I purchased<lb/>
of Acker &amp; Merrill saved five valuable<lb/>
lives during this time of trial.</p>
<p>I enjoyed so much the few hours of my<lb/>
stay with you that were not spent on<lb/>
railroads and trolleys my dear Gran.<lb/>
My trip was one continued <hi>hike</hi> from the<lb/>
time I left here until I got back but it<lb/>
was pleasant nevertheless. My only regret<lb/>
is that I did not have time to run<lb/>
down to Edgehill for a little visit.</p>
<p>All the women in the house are rushing<lb/>
madly around this morning preparing<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14341004"/>
<hi>4</hi><lb/>
for the garden party at<lb/>
the Arsenal this afternoon<lb/>
for the benefit of the Army<lb/>
widows and orphans.<lb/>
Louise is on the refreshment<lb/>
committee &amp; as usual<lb/>
is pulling a laboring car.</p>
<p>The cottage at the hospital<lb/>
is finished and I suppose<lb/>
we will move into it in<lb/>
about a week. It has three<lb/>
bed rooms, sitting room - <add>bathroom</add><lb/>
dining room &amp; a detached<lb/>
kitchen &amp; servant's room.<lb/>
So we really have no more<lb/>
room for guests than we<lb/>
have here where we, also<lb/>
have three bed rooms.<lb/>
There is a porch all around<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14341005"/>
and altho the arrangements<lb/>
might be better in some<lb/>
respects, I think we will<lb/>
be very comfortable.</p>
<p>I shall of course begin<lb/>
promptly to plant out<lb/>
things and have some flowers<lb/>
and some of these gorgeous<lb/>
crotons.</p>
<p>Tell Peg that the velvet came<lb/>
safely and thank her for<lb/>
it. I left a suit of <unclear>outing</unclear><lb/>
flannel pajamas in Nease's<lb/>
room - perhaps George when<lb/>
he comes can bring them<lb/>
down as well as the<lb/>
watches. Has Caz made<lb/>
his peace yet? Love to all<lb/>
dear Gran from</p>
