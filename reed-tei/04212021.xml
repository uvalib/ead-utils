Colonel Raymond O. Dart<lb/>
Director, Army Institute of Pathology<lb/>
7th Street and Independence Avenue, S. W.<lb/>
Washington 25, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Colonel Dart:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your letter of 9 March regarding an exhibit concerning<lb/>
Walter Reed, to be set up for the International Congress on Tropical Medicine<lb/>
in Washington in May. Doctor Sawyer has already mentioned such an exhibit<lb/>
and I shall be glad to cooperate in any way possible. I enclose a carbon<lb/>
copy which will give you an idea of what is in my collection. I would ap-<lb/>
preciate it if you would return it to me as this seems to be my only copy.<lb/>
Please let me know the following: (1) How many exhibit cases on Reed and<lb/>
his colleagues would you want to have? If you will tell me the limit of<lb/>
your available exhibiting space, that will help me in suggesting what might<lb/>
be selected from my material. (2) How long ahead of time must you have the<lb/>
material? If it is to be exhibited in display cases, no special preparation<lb/>
is necessary. I can simply bring the material along and spend a couple of<lb/>
hours setting it up in the display cases and that is what I would rather do.<lb/>
(3) If <unclear>thermaterial</unclear> is to be there the entire time of the Congress, would<lb/>
it be too late for me to set it up on Tuesday, May 11?</p>
<p>The reason I ask the latter is that a fair amount of this material<lb/>
is right now on display in cabinets in the University of Virginia Library.<lb/>
I took it down there in November and it is still there. My plan was to go<lb/>
to Charlottesville, probably May 10, get the material and come to Washington<lb/>
and set it up on May 11. If you need more than I have on display in Charlottes-<lb/>
ville, I will bring it along from here.</p>
<p>It would appear to me that you would in particular want for your<lb/>
exhibit some of the original fever charts, some of Walter Reed's original<lb/>
letters, especially the famous New Year's Eve letter and Walter Reed's<lb/>
special Congressional medal. I also have the original Walter Reed medal awarded<lb/>
to Mrs. Reed by the American Society of Tropical Medicine. As you will see,<lb/>
I have certain data concerning Lazear, Agramonte and others.</p>
<p>To satisfy the Latin Americans, you should have certain data con-<lb/>
cerning Finlay and Delgado and I would suggest that you borrow from the Surgeon<lb/>
General's Library at least Finlay's original paper, possibly three or four of<lb/>
his later papers. You could exhibit photographs of some of the Finlay busts.<lb/>
I have copies of several of these. You should have a photograph of Finlay.<lb/>
Wouldn't it be an excellent idea to have on display Cornwell's original<lb/>
painting, &ldquo;Conquerors of Yellow Fever&rdquo;. I enclose a reproduction of it. It<lb/>
was painted for Wyeth, Incorporated, and Mr. Frank Law, Vice President of<lb/>
Wyeth, Incorporated, 1600 Arch Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, will be<lb/>
the man to contact regarding this. That has become a rather well-known<lb/>
painting and I should think its demonstration at the exhibit would be most<lb/>

appropriate. If the original painting is not available, a colored reproduc-<lb/>
tion about three times the size of the one in my reprint is available for<lb/>
display.</p>
<p>If you will let me know as soon as possible about what you want,<lb/>
I will start collecting it and some of it will have to be photographed for<lb/>
the program to be used at the unveiling of the Walter Reed bust in the Hall<lb/>
of Fame, May 20.</p>
<p>I regret that I cannot accept your invitation to contribute any<lb/>
of this material to the permanent collection of the Army Medical Museum as<lb/>
I am utilizing all of this material in the publication of a book which is in<lb/>
preparation and which will take some time to finish. Indeed my collection is<lb/>
so extensive that the Mayo Foundation is considering setting aside a special<lb/>
museum room for it in the new clinic building to be built in the near future.<lb/>
Incidentally, you might borrow from the Archives the few fever charts which<lb/>
they have. I believe they have that of Private Dean and also one for Carroll<lb/>
and Lazear.</p>

P. S.: Can you help me out in one matter. I just returned yesterday from<lb/>
Cuba. I am writing a book on the Conquest of Yellow Fever considering all<lb/>
angles, the work of Finlay as well as that of the American Commission. I<lb/>
have a copy of &ldquo;The Collective Works of Dr. Carlos J. Finlay&rdquo; but this con-<lb/>
tains only a very few translations into English of his Spanish articles. In<lb/>
Cuba last week, I visited the National Academy of Sciences, the Finlay Insti-<lb/>
tute and the surviving son of Finlay and other people, asking if any of them<lb/>
had English translations of all of Finlay's papers. They did not. It occurs<lb/>
to me that Reed and His colleagues certainly must have had English translations<lb/>
of all of these articles as I don't believe Carroll or Lazear read Spanish.<lb/>
Could you find out for me whether your Institute or whether the Surgeon General's<lb/>
Library has such translations. I am most anxious to have them.<lb/>
