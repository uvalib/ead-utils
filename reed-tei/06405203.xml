In re Special Order 83. Dept. of Western Cuba-<lb/>
<dateline>

<salute>My dear Col. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am not as prompt in my attention<lb/>
to business as you and Gen. Ireland<lb/>
are, and Mrs Kean was disturbed at<lb/>
the Lambert papers being still on my<lb/>
desk- So last night after reading the<lb/>
photostats of Dr. Brumby's speech to the<lb/>
Texas Med. Assn &amp; the other photostats, I<lb/>
found an envelope that would contain<lb/>
them and sealed, addressed, stamped them,<lb/>
so they are ready to be mailed this morning<lb/>
as soon as I can get someone to take them-<lb/>
I got to thinking this morning why it was<lb/>
necessary for me to have an order issued by<lb/>
the Dept. of Western Cuba for Dr. Ames and<lb/>
several enlisted men to be ordered to report<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06405204"/>
to Major Reed, and it all came back to me-<lb/>
Of course <add>it</add> did not make Ames or the enlisted<lb/>
men members of the Reed Board- That would<lb/>
require an order from the War Dept. which<lb/>
created the Board, and no one who had any<lb/>
knowledge of Army administration would<lb/>
ever think of such a thing- But Camp Lazier<lb/>
was outside of the military reservation and<lb/>
to send military personnel there for any<lb/>
purpose would require an order from military<lb/>
authority- The normal military authority<lb/>
to issue it was the Post Commander- But<lb/>
he was not a normal person, and would<lb/>
probably refuse, especially if he could <unclear>annoy</unclear><lb/>
Gen. Wood by so doing- So I asked the<lb/>
next highest military commander who was<lb/>
my chief Gen Fitzhugh Lee to issue the<lb/>
order, and forgot all about it, until it<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06405205"/>
3<lb/>
appeared in Lambert's statement and was<lb/>
given the absurd interpretation which Dr.<lb/>
Brumby gave it- Ordinarily <add>not</add> a formal order<lb/>
but only verbal approval would be necessary for<lb/>
such activities so near the post- Whether orders<lb/>
were issued in the cases of other men who<lb/>
were on duty at Camp Lazear either as<lb/>
attendants or experimental patients I do<lb/>
not remember- I did not keep a copy of<lb/>
Special Order 83 or any like order, They were<lb/>
just ordinary details of none except tempo-<lb/>
rary importance- I cannot but admire <unclear>tho</unclear><lb/>
persistent industry by which this S. O. was<lb/>
looked up and found, and the ingenuity<lb/>
by which a meaning which it never had, has been<lb/>
injected into it-</p>
<p>I hope that you had a pleasant journey<lb/>
home and do not feel that the time and<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06405206"/>
money which you expended in your trip to<lb/>
washington were wasted- Your presence<lb/>
at the meeting gave great pleasure to a<lb/>
group of worthy &ldquo;has feens&rdquo; and, as my friend<lb/>
Ireland thought, unduly stimulated the<lb/>
loquacity of one or more of them- I have<lb/>
felt that Mrs Kean's comment on our failure<lb/>
to make any proper arrangements for your<lb/>
entertainment was quite justified- She<lb/>
said that we were all asleep at the<lb/>
switch- We will do better next time.</p>
<p>With all good wishes</p>
<closer>
<salute>sincerely yours</salute>
