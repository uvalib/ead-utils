Dr. Henry Rose Carter, Jr.<lb/>
Woodward Building,<lb/>
Birmingham, Alabama<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just received a letter from Dr. Philip S. Hench, a professor<lb/>
of medicine at Rochester and one of the owners of the Mayo Clinic, - and<lb/>
have conferred about it by phone this morning with your good friend<lb/>
Louis L. Williams, Jr., who as you may know is happily engaged in the<lb/>
State Department in straightening out international health matters.</p>
<p>Dr. Hench is writing a book on the work of Walter Reed and his associ-<lb/>
ates. You may have noticed that it was Hench who stimulated General Truby<lb/>
(recently in command at the Army Medical Center) to write his recently<lb/>
published book on recollections of the 1900 investigational days in Cuba.<lb/>
Hench writes that the Reed family and the Lazear family have made him the<lb/>
repository of all their letters, etc. - he had dinner with General Reed<lb/>
and his sister last week, also visited Mrs. Walter Reed (aged 90) at<lb/>
Blue Ridge Summit, also Mrs. G. O. Gawne, a first cousin of Dr. Lazear.<lb/>
He had previously visited Lazear's widow who died in February, and during<lb/>
the summer of 1946, Lazear's son and daughters in California. His industry<lb/>
of that sort seems indefatigable, and it occurs to Louis Williams and my-<lb/>
self that this may be an opportunity to get the whole thing straight in a<lb/>
way that would have pleased your father. What do you think of it?</p>
<p>I know that one of the objects of your father in not publicizing to<lb/>
a greater extent his own work was that no detraction in the slightest<lb/>
should result toward the work of his good friend Walter Reed.</p>
<p>Louis has told me that you have the presentation copy of the official<lb/>
Cuban book on Finlay edited by Juan Guiteras with your father's pencilled<lb/>
notes in the margin stating that your father carried the crucial mosquitoes<lb/>
(or eggs or larvae) from Finlay to Lazear or Reed. And it is my impression<lb/>
that if it had not been for your father there would have been no cooperation<lb/>
between Finlay and Reed.</p>
<p>If you do think well of the scheme and would be good enough to let me<lb/>
borrow this book-and any other matter that you would think pertinent to<lb/>
the general subject-I would have them photographed promptly for preserva-<lb/>
tion of copies in the Public Health Service files, send copies to Dr.<lb/>
Hench, and return the originals, with copies, to you. I also have copies<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0407003"/>
- 2 -<lb/>
of a letter which Walter Reed wrote to your father, and some other notes<lb/>
which I would be glad to send you if you would like to have them. I have<lb/>
hunted in vain through the Army Medical Library for your father's original<lb/>
manuscript which he deposited there. It is lost.</p>
<p>Hench believes, and it seems right, that he has discovered the site<lb/>
of the original Camp Lazear near Havana, which was not the site marked<lb/>
by the Cuban government. He wants to preserve the building No.1 which<lb/>
he thinks he has identified and to erect a small museum over it, by 1950.</p>
