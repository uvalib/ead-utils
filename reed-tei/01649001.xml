<salute>My darling Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>After a day<lb/>
of many disappointments, it<lb/>
is a very great pleasure to<lb/>
be able to sit in my rock-<lb/>
ing chair &amp;, at my leisure,<lb/>
peruse your sweet letter.<lb/>
At one time, I began to think<lb/>
that you had forgotten to<lb/>
write, or else was waiting<lb/>
for the arrival of the &ldquo;little<lb/>
package-&rdquo; Being compelled<lb/>
to visit New York City,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01649002"/>
this morning, I rode over to<lb/>
Whitestone with the mail-<lb/>
carrier in order to get your<lb/>
letter- Of course, my heart<lb/>
was light, as it always is,<lb/>
when anticipating a message<lb/>
from your darling, sweet<lb/>
self. (Allow me to ask, by way<lb/>
of parenthesis, do I use too<lb/>
many words of endearment?<lb/>
Although I ask, I don't expect<lb/>
an<del>y</del> answer- I only want to<lb/>
say that <add>if</add> I were master of<lb/>
ten thousand words, all express-<lb/>
ing whatever is pure and love-<lb/>
ly &amp; sweet, I would write<lb/>
them down &amp; then feel <del>c</del>how<lb/>
feebly they expressed the<lb/>
inexpressible emotions of<lb/>
my heart!) But to my nar-<lb/>
rative -- Arriving at the P.O.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01649003"/>
to my very great disappoint-<lb/>
ment, there was no letter<lb/>
for &ldquo;Dr Reed,&rdquo; and I was<lb/>
about as sad as &ldquo;love-sick<lb/>
boy&rdquo; could be. With a coun-<lb/>
tenance, woefully elongated,<lb/>
I left the office &amp; went to<lb/>
the Depot- and thence to New<lb/>
York, by cars; all the way<lb/>
wondering what had become<lb/>
of my letter- I'm afraid, that<lb/>
the remarks, I made use<lb/>
of, were not <hi>very</hi> flatter-<lb/>
ing to the various Post-<lb/>
masters between here and<lb/>
Murfreesboro. When I got<lb/>
to New York, I couldn't find<lb/>
the gentleman I wanted<lb/>
to see &amp; was compelled<lb/>
to wait more than an hour,<lb/>
at his office, before he<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01649004"/>
arrived. This was disappoint-<lb/>
ment <hi>no. 2</hi>- I then paddled<lb/>
my Canoe toward Fultan<lb/>
Market, for the purpose of<lb/>
purchasing some peaches<lb/>
for our mess -- You perceive<lb/>
that I am <hi>caterer</hi> for the<lb/>
mess, during this month, &amp;<lb/>
hence have to superintend<lb/>
the purchasing of all ar-<lb/>
ticles of food- In other<lb/>
words, I am the <hi>house-keep-<lb/>
er</hi>, just at present- am <hi>lear-<lb/>
ning</hi>, you see, so that when<lb/>
<hi>you</hi> &amp; <hi>I</hi> are ensconced in<lb/>
our little cottage, I will be<lb/>
able to <hi>lighten your bur-<lb/>
den</hi>. Having selected a large<lb/>
basketful of beautiful<lb/>
fruit, I sent it by a boy<lb/>
to Pier 1, from which point<lb/>
our steamer leaves for this<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01649005"/>
Point- This done, I strolled<lb/>
along leisurely through va-<lb/>
rious streets &amp; at last, ar-<lb/>
rived at the same Pier-</p>
<p>To my di<add>s</add>gust, I found that the<lb/>
Searge<del>a</del>nt, in charge of the dock,<lb/>
had sent my fruit to Gover-<lb/>
nors Island. Disappointment,<lb/>
<hi>no. 3.!</hi> Seeing that all my<lb/>
efforts came to an unlucky<lb/>
termination, I immediately<lb/>
embarked on board the Steam-<lb/>
er for this place, feeling that<lb/>
all creation was arrayed<lb/>
against me! And what<lb/>
has served to banish this<lb/>
feeling? For I assure you,<lb/>
that I am in the best of<lb/>
humor, just now. It is all<lb/>
owing to the fact that, on<lb/>
reaching home, I found your<lb/>
precious letter!</p>
<p>Know, my darling Emilie,<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01649006"/>
that the request you make of<lb/>
me shall be complied with,<lb/>
&amp; that <add>too,</add> with pleasure- Don't<lb/>
be afraid, my lovely little &ldquo;B,&rdquo;<lb/>
that I will yield to the temp-<lb/>
tations that may surround<lb/>
me- The love which I bear<lb/>
you is a sure barrier<lb/>
against all of these. At the<lb/>
same time, I love you yet<lb/>
more for the interest which<lb/>
you manifest in my be-<lb/>
half- Ah! what a help it<lb/>
is, in the discharge of all<lb/>
my duties, to know that<lb/>
there is an eye that watches<lb/>
my course. God Bless you,<lb/>
my own precious E, you shall<lb/>
never have occasion to be<lb/>
ashamed of me! Please say<lb/>
to the <hi>kind</hi> person who<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01649007"/>
warned you to beware of<lb/>
the Long Island damsels,<lb/>
lest some one of them steal<lb/>
away my heart; that I am<lb/>
sorry that any one could<lb/>
entertain so poor an opin-<lb/>
ion of my honesty, &amp; for my<lb/>
sake, tell the person, that<lb/>
were all the maidens of this<lb/>
Island combined in one &amp; that<lb/>
one possessed of riches un-<lb/>
numbered, I would not turn<lb/>
on my heel to win her smile!<lb/>
My heart has already been sto-<lb/>
len by one who far surpas-<lb/>
ses any thing that this Is-<lb/>
land can boast of;- and<lb/>
it remains with that one<lb/>
to say what shall be the<lb/>
disposal of that heart!<lb/>
No! My darling, the more I<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01649008"/>
am thrown into the society<lb/>
of other ladies, the more do I<lb/>
appreciate <hi>your</hi> sterling worth.<lb/>
Although there are many very<lb/>
beautiful villages &amp; resi-<lb/>
dences surrounding Willet's<lb/>
Point, yet, with all my heart,<lb/>
can I say:</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Ah dear, charming Murfreesboro,</l>
<l>How I <hi>long</hi> for the shade of thy groves,</l>
<l>To recline 'neath which were a</l>
<l>Pleasure to the soul that solitude loves.</l>
<l>Full oft in my dreaming hours,</l>
<l>Have I returned, to roam</l>
<l>&ldquo;Midst thy friendly bowers,</l>
<l>And <hi>feel the peace</hi> of <hi>home</hi>!</l>
</lg>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, my darling,<lb/>
As ever, your fond<lb/>
and devoted</salute>
<signed>Walter</signed>.
