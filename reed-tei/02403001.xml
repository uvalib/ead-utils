Doogy.<lb/>

</opener>
<p>Why didn't<lb/>
you have a letter ready<lb/>
when the mail came, on<lb/>
yesterday? was it that<lb/>
you forgot to write, you<lb/>
sweet Miss Gouty, in the<lb/>
midst of your &ldquo;teas&rdquo; &amp;<lb/>
theatres? Or did that silly<lb/>
rumor that poor, good<lb/>
old Beechner hurried-<lb/>
ly carried to you about<lb/>
my coming completely<lb/>
upset you? I had a<lb/>
letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyers<lb/>
on yesterday, in which<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02403002"/>
he stated that a rumor<lb/>
had reached the museum<lb/>
that I would be home, last<lb/>
Saturday, and that Beechner<lb/>
had unfortunately hurried<lb/>
over to tell you! wasn't<lb/>
that a perfect shame!<lb/>
and how could such a<lb/>
report have been carried<lb/>
to Washington? I can't imag<lb/>
ine how such a thing could<lb/>
have happened? Or did<lb/>
you, like a sensible woman,<lb/>
pay no attention to it?<lb/>
I sincerely hope so, or<lb/>
my babies must have been<lb/>
very much disappointed-<lb/>
I am rejoiced, sweetheart,<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02403003"/>
that the time is rapidly<lb/>
slipping by, when we <hi>will</hi><lb/>
, start home- I am, every<lb/>
day, now engaged in writing<lb/>
our paper for the Congress<lb/>
and will have it in shape<lb/>
in about 10 days more- Then<lb/>
I shall take it very easy<lb/>
till the time comes to read<lb/>
it- I don't know how I shall<lb/>
feel when I stand before<lb/>
an audience of several<lb/>
hundred foreigners, but guess<lb/>
that I can manage to hold<lb/>
my own- About 1000 del-<lb/>
egates are expected, but<lb/>
I don't think that so many<lb/>
will come -- we have had<lb/>
our <hi>6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> case</hi>, to-day - and<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02403004"/>
this last one has proven<lb/>
of more interest to me than<lb/>
any of the preceding, as we<lb/>
infected him with mosqui-<lb/>
toes that had bitten <hi>one<lb/>
of our own cases</hi>, and a<lb/>
<hi>mild</hi> one at that- Again<lb/>
it shows so clearly that<lb/>
the mosquitoes cannot<lb/>
infect under 12 days; at<lb/>
least not at this season<lb/>
of the year- He has all of the<lb/>
typical symptoms of a<lb/>
well marked case and will<lb/>
be seen by the experts to-<lb/>
morrow or next day- The<lb/>
men who have been now 35<lb/>
nights in our infected clothing<lb/>
building are perfectly well!<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02403005"/>
And yet there will be fools<lb/>
who will shall <add>say</add> that unpack-<lb/>
ing an old trunk, or opening<lb/>
a closet where some suppos-<lb/>
edly infected garment hangs,<lb/>
will always convey yellow<lb/>
fever! What a world this<lb/>
is anyway in which we<lb/>
live! It will be as hard<lb/>
for Gen. Sternberg to give up<lb/>
the infected clothing theory<lb/>
as anyone else, for he has<lb/>
in his various writings<lb/>
espoused it as one of the<lb/>
<del>things</del> facts that were well<lb/>
established! But we have<lb/>
already knocked this theory<lb/>
to simple Smithereens!<lb/>
<hi>Hurrah</hi>! <hi>Hip</hi>! <hi>Hurrah</hi>!!<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02403006"/>
I have a long letter from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
Woodhull in which he tells<lb/>
me that before formulating<lb/>
finally a theory, I should care-<lb/>
fully <add>read</add> this mans account<lb/>
of an epidemic on board<lb/>
some ship, &amp; that man's<lb/>
(Tom, Dick, or Harry's) ac-<lb/>
count of an outbreak of<lb/>
yellow fever on the Mary<lb/>
Jane at Barbadoes, &amp; c, &amp; c,<lb/>
When I recall that the doc-<lb/>
tor still is not convinced<lb/>
that mosquitoes convey<lb/>
Malaria, I shan't waste<lb/>
any words, trying to per-<lb/>
suade him as to how<lb/>
yellow fever is propagated-<lb/>
we will put the facts be-<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02403007"/>
fore him and others, &amp; if they are<lb/>
not then convinced, nothing<lb/>
would convince them.<lb/>
The mode of propagation of<lb/>
yellow fever is no longer<lb/>
a <hi>theory</hi> - it is <hi>a fact</hi>! and<lb/>
a <hi>well-established one</hi> at<lb/>
that! But why am I writing<lb/>
all of this to my darling wifie?<lb/>
I suppose that because she<lb/>
has become so much in-<lb/>
terested in this work of<lb/>
her dear old M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mantee!<lb/>
and that I <hi>must</hi> have an <hi>au-<lb/>
-dience</hi>!! By the way, <hi>the cake</hi>,<lb/>
old Mother Goose's- I beg par-<lb/>
don- Mother Greer's cake is<lb/>
now in Havana &amp; I will<lb/>
get it <hi>tomorrow</hi>! <hi>my</hi>! won't<lb/>
I enjoy it? no danger of<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02403008"/>
<hi>gout</hi> here, lovie, dear! And it<lb/>
has just occurred to me that<lb/>
it will be perfectly delight-<lb/>
ful here after to sit <del>up</del> and<lb/>
leisurely imbibe <hi>all</hi> of the<lb/>
mixture of <hi>old Crow</hi> &amp; <hi>Mint</hi>!<lb/>
For of course, my sweet wifie<lb/>
musn't take <hi>even one drop</hi>!<lb/>
oh no! lovie, dear, &ldquo;Tanglefoot<lb/>
is very, very injurious to the<lb/>
<hi>gouty constitution</hi>! D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nash<lb/>
has already told you that!<lb/>
of course, sweet scholar from<lb/>
An<add>n</add>apolis can have a small<lb/>
<hi>thimbleful occasionally</hi>! But the<lb/>
large, crisp, gurgling, &ldquo;<hi>gulps</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
will be &ldquo;<hi>me own</hi>&rdquo; &amp; <hi>none<lb/>
others</hi>!! He! He! Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho!<lb/>
Good-night, you sweet joys!<lb/>
Pleasant dreams of old M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><lb/>
mosquito! Boo! Boo!!!<lb/>

<hi>Friday Evening January 4</hi><hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. A<lb/>
real warm day this 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Jan-<lb/>
uary has been, followed by<lb/>
one of the most beautiful moon-<lb/>
light nights I have ever beheld-<lb/>
At 6 o'clock, a beautiful rain<lb/>
came and now with the light,<lb/>
fleecy, fluffy clouds and the<lb/>
full moon, it is simply<lb/>
heavenly. I wish that my<lb/>
darling girls could see this<lb/>
night -- and I wonder what they<lb/>
are doing- Has precious<lb/>
Miss Annapolis returned<lb/>
from her Christmas outing?<lb/>
Is she back once more at<lb/>
her books like a dear sweet<lb/>
girl? Did big M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles<lb/>
Wheatley meet her at the<lb/>
train with another box of<lb/>
Candy? You know, I rather<lb/>
&ldquo;take&rdquo; to that boy! He cer-<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02403010"/>
tainly shows <hi>very good taste</hi>!<lb/>
Our patient, a very gentleman-<lb/>
ly spaniard, is doing as well<lb/>
as we could expect at this<lb/>
stage of his illness- He bears<lb/>
his pains so patiently that one<lb/>
can't help sympathizing with<lb/>
him- We injected his blood under<lb/>
the skin of a soldier to-day --<lb/>
<hi>Saturday Morning 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>. What a very<lb/>
rainy morning! and the moisture<lb/>
is coming right in from the sea,<lb/>
and from the north- Dear me!<lb/>
I am afraid that you have<lb/>
been having some bad weather<lb/>
in the U.S- I almost shiver<lb/>
at the idea of running into <hi>cold</hi><lb/>
weather once more- Have me<lb/>
a <hi>nice hot Toddie ready</hi> when<lb/>
I come, lovie, dear! Don't make<lb/>
but <hi>one</hi> at a time! He! He! Ho!<lb/>
Ho! Goodbye, you darling Joys!<lb/>
Kisses &amp; love &amp; love &amp; kisses for<lb/>
my precious girls-</p>
