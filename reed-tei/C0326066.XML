<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your good letter of November 27th. was awaiting me here on<lb/>
my return from a three days stay in Baltimore with the Frosts.</p>
<p>As usual, Dr. Frost was extremely busy. However, on Thanks-<lb/>
giving night he took off time to go over and discuss the maps and<lb/>
other accumulated material and problems that I had brought over with me.<lb/>
As I told you, in my letter of November 24th., one of the things I es-<lb/>
pecially wished to get cleared up was what Dr. Frost wanted done about<lb/>
these maps before having them inked in. I am glad to say that he was<lb/>
much pleased with the work done on the maps this summer, although he<lb/>
wishes some minor changes made. These I have already blocked out in<lb/>
pencil and will shortly get in proper shape for the completion of the<lb/>
maps.</p>
<p>Dr. Frost and I also decided that a third map, considerably<lb/>
smaller that the other two, should be inserted in the book at the<lb/>
place dealing with the expeditions of Ojeda, Nicuesa <hi>et</hi>  <hi>al</hi>. This would<lb/>
be practically a XVIth. Century &ldquo;shore line map&rdquo; of that part of the<lb/>
Caribbean literal comprising part of Colombia: &ldquo;Darien:&rdquo; Panama: Nice-<lb/>
ragus and, possible, Honduras. I am therefore now engaged in working<lb/>
up the data for this map--considerably more of an undertaking <unclear>than</unclear> for<lb/>
the previous two, because of the chronological limitations. It in-<lb/>
volves quite a good deal of reading as well as the examination of <add>such</add><lb/>
XVIth. Century maps already in existence <add>as are available</add>. <del><unclear>n</unclear></del><add>N</add>one of <del>which</del><add>these</add> individually have,<lb/>
so far, been found to contain all the data needed for our argument in<lb/>
Section iii, part i (con.) &ldquo;Other Parts of America.&rdquo; When this has been<lb/>
worked up, however, the map will be much simpler for the cartographer to<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fc0326067"/>
draw than were the previous two.</p>
<p>Dr. Frost still hopes to finish the final editing of Father's<lb/>
MS by the end of the year, if nothing unforeseen happens. I hardly<lb/>
think that possible as he left for New York the Sunday after Thanks-<lb/>
giving and also had a trip to Canada in prospect before Xmas. However,<lb/>
it does sound as if , to quote from your last letter, we may hope for the<lb/>
completion of the Introduction and editing &ldquo;before very long.&rdquo; Of course,<lb/>
even after that, there will be the final typing, which Dr. Frost said you<lb/>
had agreed should be done under his supervision at the School of Hygiene.<lb/>
There will also be the reading of this final typewritten copy: by Dr.<lb/>
Frost for the text, and by Miss Brown and myself for typographical errors,<lb/>
especially in the bibliography and in the quotations in foreign lan-<lb/>
guages. This same procedure should be followed in the galley and page<lb/>
proof, in addition to that of the routine work of the professional proof<lb/>
readers of the publisher. All of this, of course, means a &ldquo;hang-over&rdquo;<lb/>
into 1930, but once the Introduction and editing are completed the rest<lb/>
should be &ldquo;plain sailing.&rdquo; and also, I believe, &ldquo;fast sailing,&rdquo; i. e.<lb/>
more or less mechanical things, which can be pushed as Dr. Frost's pres-<lb/>
ent work cannot be.</p>
<p>I had hoped <hi>much</hi> last spring that the book would be &ldquo;between<lb/>
covers&rdquo; by Xmas. That hope &ldquo;died hard,&rdquo; but I earnestly trust that the<lb/>
New Year may be kinder than the Old and that <add>we</add> shall &ldquo;make port&rdquo; <unclear>before</unclear><lb/>
very long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all manner of good wishes, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>
