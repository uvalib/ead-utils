<title>Yellow Fever: An Epidemiological and Historical Study of Its Place of Origin, by Henry Rose Carter, 1931</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Laura Armistead Carter and Wade Hampton Frost edited Henry Rose Carter's book on yellow fever. It is divided into three main sections: the epidemiology of yellow fever; diseases which have, or might have, been confused with yellow fever in the past; and the place of the origin of yellow fever. Carter concludes that biological as well as historical evidence favors an African origin of yellow fever.</p>

<p>It would seem natural, in writing a history of any disease, first to<lb/>
collect the different accounts of its occurrence and from them to deter-<lb/>
mine its extent and severity in different epochs. From these data<lb/>
would be determined its extension or diminution in area and in intensity<lb/>
--time being our other variant. Ultimately, from the historical facts<lb/>
thus presented, the epidemiology of the disease would, or might, be<lb/>
derived. Thus, indeed, have our existing histories of diseases been<lb/>
written.</p>
<p>A different--almost a reversed--method will be followed for yellow<lb/>
fever in this work, and for these reasons: The reports and accounts of<lb/>
the occurrence of yellow fever--and of its absence as well--are, in a<lb/>
number of cases, not only unreliable, but erroneous. This was inevita-<lb/>
ble. The diagnosis of yellow fever is not always clear, and it was<lb/>
especially apt to be mistaken when yellow fever was considered, on<lb/>
the one hand, to be an intense form of malarial fever, and on the other,<lb/>
typhus fever modified by a hot climate. Both of these diseases have<lb/>
been reported as yellow fever, and yellow fever has been reported cer-<lb/>
tainly as the first, if not as the second.</p>
<p>On the other hand, certain facts in the epidemiology of yellow fever<lb/>
are established and definitely known, and by them we can, in many<lb/>
cases, test--in some test absolutely--the truth or error of the account<lb/>
submitted to us. We know quite well the conditions necessary for the<lb/>
existence of yellow fever, for it to become epidemic and to continue at<lb/>
any place; and when we find its existence or an epidemic reported where<lb/>
the conditions necessary therefor do not exist, we know that the disease<lb/>
reported as such is not yellow fever. Similarly, when yellow fever is<lb/>
reported as continuing for a term of years at a place under conditions<lb/>
where this continuance is impossible, we know either that the disease<lb/>
in question was not yellow fever or that it ceased and was reintroduced.</p>
<p>Provided that we are conservative and postulate no conditions except<lb/>
such as are proven, there is no escape from these two conclusions; and<lb/>
by them not a few questions which have given rise to much and bitter<lb/>
controversy can be settled definitely and--what is more important--<lb/>
settled correctly.</p>

AUTHOR'S PREFACE</p>
<p>It is for this reason that this work will begin with the statement of a<lb/>
few principles established in the epidemiology of yellow fever by which<lb/>
we may be able to sift some of the historical evidence to be submitted<lb/>
later.</p>

<head>NOTE BY THE EDITORS</head>
<pb n="vii" id="Cb000009"/>
<p>Early in 1922, shortly after his retirement from active duty in the<lb/>
United States Public Health Service, the author of this work, at the<lb/>
request of Dr. Wickliffe Rose, then Director of the International Health<lb/>
Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, and with material assistance<lb/>
from that organization, undertook the writing of a history of yellow<lb/>
fever. This was an undertaking which he had long contemplated when-<lb/>
ever he should have the leisure, and for which he had prepared himself<lb/>
by a lifetime devoted very largely to the study of yellow fever in the field<lb/>
and in the literature.</p>
<p>As originally projected, the work was to have been a history of yellow<lb/>
fever to the present time, extending the histories by B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud<lb/>
and others to include the period since the establishment of scientific<lb/>
and effective control, and reviewing earlier history in the light of modern<lb/>
knowledge. From the first, however, this plan was conditional upon<lb/>
his health and what he might consider a reasonable expectation of life,<lb/>
and it soon became apparent that this would not suffice for any work of<lb/>
more than a few years' duration. His effort was, therefore, directed<lb/>
to the completion, during his lifetime, of a section which would be<lb/>
complete in itself, which could be only the early history of the disease.</p>
<p>Even this was completed only by working throughout an illness<lb/>
severe enough to confine him to bed for long intervals, and, during his<lb/>
last year, continuously. At his death, in 1925, the work that is here<lb/>
presented had been fully drafted in its present scope and content.<lb/>
However, none of it had undergone final revision, and while the section<lb/>
on epidemiology and other portions which had been written quite early<lb/>
would probably have been revised but little, the latter part of the manu-<lb/>
script, dealing with Africa, had been drafted only roughly, with fairly<lb/>
numerous notes indicating more or less definitely contemplated revisions<lb/>
or additional references to be consulted.</p>
<p>In preparing the material for publication we have, of course, made<lb/>
such alterations as were clearly indicated by the author's notes, with<lb/>
some rearrangements in sequence and subdivisions. We have, how-<lb/>
ever, refrained from any revisions excepting such as we are confident<lb/>
the author himself would have made. Consequently, the work is pre-<lb/>
sented with considerably less revision than we think it would have re-<lb/>
ceived at his hands.</p>

NOTE BY THE EDITORS</p>
<p>So many of the author's friends have contributed to his work in one<lb/>
way or another that it is hardly possible to make full acknowledgment.<lb/>
In his behalf we are happy to acknowledge indebtedness to Dr. Wickliffe<lb/>
Rose, Director of the International Health Board, and to his successor,<lb/>
General F. F. Russell, for indispensable assistance in many ways, and<lb/>
equally for their interest and encouragement; to Dr. Juan Martinez<lb/>
Hernandez of Merida, Yucatan, and Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley of the<lb/>
Carnegie Institution of Washington, for advice and information on<lb/>
Maya archaeology; to Dr. F. W. Edwards of the British Museum and<lb/>
Dr. L. O. Howard of the United States Bureau of Entomology, for<lb/>
assistance in matters entomological; to Dr. Joseph H. White of the<lb/>
United States Public Health Service and to Drs. Michael E. Connor,<lb/>
E. J. Scannell, G. Jameson Carr, and Henry Hanson of the staff of the<lb/>
International Health Board, for notes on various subjects; and to the<lb/>
librarians and staff of the Library of Congress, the Library of the<lb/>
Surgeon General of the Army, and the Public Health Service Library,<lb/>
for many special courtesies.</p>
<p>In the verification and listing of bibliographic references, we have<lb/>
received invaluable assistance from Miss Grace Brown, of the Catalogue<lb/>
Division of the Library of Congress, to whom we are especially indebted<lb/>
for this and many other services, as also to Mr. Charles Martel, Chief<lb/>
of the Catalogue Division of the same Library, for his assistance and<lb/>
advice.</p>

<item>The writer hesitated long whether to use <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi> as the vernacular form for<lb/>
the name of this vector, simply because he and other medical writers had always<lb/>
done so. For the Americas this has been allowable and definitive, because no<lb/>
other species of this subgenus is found here. For a general history, however, as<lb/>
there are a number of <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi>) species in the Old World, this would not<lb/>
be definitive of the only known vector, and for this reason he decided to use the<lb/>
species name, which is definitive everywhere.</item>

YELLOW FEVER</item>
<item>In one of the cases observed by the writer at Orwood, Mississippi,<lb/>
in 1898 (Carter, H. R., 1900-a and 1901-b)--which observations formed<lb/>
the basis of the doctrine of extrinsic incubation--the interval between<lb/>
the occurrence of the infecting and a secondary case was recorded as<lb/>
eleven and one-half days, which would give eight and one-half days as<lb/>
the maximum period of <hi rend="italic">extrinsic</hi> incubation. Naturally, the dates of<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">occurrence</hi> of cases are less exactly recorded from histories given by<lb/>
laymen (patients and members of their families), even if much pains be<lb/>
taken, than in experimental cases. The <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> of error, however, in<lb/>
the former would be rather to lengthen this apparent interval than to<lb/>
shorten it.</item>
<item>(4) Once infective, the insect remains so as long as we have observed<lb/>
her--probably all her life. A feeding fifty-seven days<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> after the infect-<lb/>
ing feeding has proved positive (Reed, Carroll, and Agramonte, 1901).</item>
<item>(5) The evidence is decidedly against the transmission of infection<lb/>
to her progeny--certainly not so as to be of general sanitary importance.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi><lb/>
A single case, the nature of which was not as definitely determined as<lb/>
we could wish, is reported by the French Commission working at Rio<lb/>
(Marchoux and Simond, 1906). Many negative results were obtained<lb/>
by Working Party No. 3 of the U. S. Public Health and Marine-Hospital<lb/>
Service at Vera Cruz (Rosenau and Goldberger, 1906) in 1903, and,<lb/>
incidentally, the same result was obtained in 1901 and 1902 at Las<lb/>
Animas Hospital, Havana, where, among the mosquitoes kept over from<lb/>
Reed's experiments for use the next year, were a number which were the<lb/>
progeny of those that had conveyed yellow fever in 1900. These, so<lb/>
long as they lived, were fed from the hands of people immune or sus-<lb/>
ceptible to yellow fever indiscriminately, without anyone's showing<lb/>
infection.</item>
<item>(6) The mosquito, both before and after becoming infective, feeds by<lb/>
day and by night (see Reed and Carroll, 1901; Howard, Dyar, and<lb/>
Knab, 1912-17, vol. 1, pp. 262-270; Macfie, 1915; Seidelin and Summers-<lb/>

<p>RECENT EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>Since this manuscript was written, and subsequent to the author's death,<lb/>
experimental studies have added much to previous knowledge of the virus of<lb/>
yellow fever, the mechanism of its transmission, and the pathology and immunol-<lb/>
ogy of the disease. Beginning with the discovery, in 1927, by Stokes, Bauer, and<lb/>
Hudson (1), of the West African Yellow Fever Commission of the Rockefeller<lb/>
Foundation, that Indian monkeys (<hi rend="italic">Macacus rhesus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macacus sinicus</hi>) were<lb/>
readily susceptible to this infection, experimental investigations have developed<lb/>
so rapidly that within three years the literature has already become too extensive<lb/>
for review in a brief space. Moreover, work in this field is still in a very active<lb/>
stage, so that a review which would be complete at this time (September, 1930)<lb/>
might be wholly inadequate within a few months. Therefore, comment here is<lb/>
limited to noting recent observations on points to which Dr. Carter specifically<lb/>
refers in his discussion of the epidemiology of the disease, with no attempt to<lb/>
note all recent contributions of importance.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) <hi rend="italic">Susceptible animals</hi>. Several species of Indian monkeys (<hi rend="italic">Macacus rhesus,<lb/>
M. sinicus</hi>, and others) have been found susceptible to experimental infection,<lb/>
developing a reaction which is well marked and frequently fatal, characterized by<lb/>
gross and microscopic lesions which definitely identify it with yellow fever in man,<lb/>
and resulting in immunity which is demonstrable by resistance to subsequent<lb/>
inoculation and by protective properties of the blood-serum. A number of<lb/>
Brazilian monkeys (species of <hi rend="italic">Cebus, Lagothrix, Atelus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Saimiri</hi>) have been<lb/>
found more or less susceptible, showing evidence of multiplication of the virus<lb/>
and development of immune bodies, but usually without severe reaction or dis-<lb/>
tinctive lesions (2, 3, 4). Chimpanzees (African) and such varieties of African<lb/>
monkeys as have been tested have proved insusceptible to the disease but, in<lb/>
some instances, have been found capable of transmitting the infection some days<lb/>
after inoculation and have shown evidence of the development of protective anti-<lb/>
bodies (1, 19). Mice have been shown to be susceptible to a specific effect of the<lb/>
virus when it is introduced directly into the central nervous system (20).</item>

YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
GENERAL POSTULATE</p>
<p>From the facts stated it is evident that, in general, we have the postu-<lb/>
late: <hi rend="italic">For the naturally continued existence of yellow fever in any place<lb/>
there are necessary three factors, coexistent at that place:</hi></p>
<p><list type="ordered">

<item>(2) <hi rend="italic">Functionally active A&euml;des (Stegomyia) aegypti mosquitoes</hi>. Pos-</item>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>infected by direct inoculation of blood from infective men (1); by inoculation of<lb/>
blood and tissues from infective monkeys; by the bites of <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des aegypti</hi> previously<lb/>
fed on infective monkeys--after a period of extrinsic incubation--and by the<lb/>
injection of macerated bodies or parts of bodies of such mosquitoes within the<lb/>
period of extrinsic incubation (5, 6, 7).</p>
<p>The blood of persons suffering from yellow fever has been found infective for<lb/>
monkeys within the first three days of illness but not thereafter (8, 9), confirming<lb/>
the observations in earlier human experiments. In monkeys infected by mosqui-<lb/>
toes, the blood has been found infective through mosquitoes 24 hours after inocu-<lb/>
lation, that is, well before the onset of a distinct febrile reaction (10).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">A&euml;des aegypti</hi> have been found infective to monkeys, by biting, as early as nine<lb/>
days after first feeding on an infected monkey (10). This is three days less than<lb/>
the minimum period of extrinsic incubation observed in mosquitoes infected by<lb/>
biting man.</p>
<p>A single <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des aegypti</hi> has been found infective for monkeys certainly 91 days<lb/>
and probably 101 days after last infective feeding (1). Infectivity, once estab-<lb/>
lished in the mosquito, appears to persist throughout the life of the insect (1).</p>
<p>The possibility of transmission of infectivity from infective female mosquitoes<lb/>
to their progeny has been extensively investigated, with uniformly negative<lb/>
results (1, 11).</p>

several other species of mosquitoes have been found capable of transmitting the<lb/>
infection from monkey to monkey by their bites after a period of extrinsic incuba-<lb/>

(= Costalis Lw.) in Africa; and with <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Ochlerotatus</hi>) <hi rend="italic">serratus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des</hi><lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Taeniorhyncus</hi>) <hi rend="italic">taeniorhyncus</hi> in America. How far any of these, other than<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">A&euml;des aegypti</hi>, may be factors of sanitary importance in the natural transmission<lb/>
of the infection is at present undetermined (12,13,14,15).</item>

<p>sibly some other species of this subgenus may prove also to be a vector--<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">A&euml;des</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi>) <hi rend="italic">alba picta</hi> is very similar in its biology to <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>.<lb/>
However, <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> is the only species of this subgenus found in the Ameri-<lb/>
cas and, owing to the invariable disappearance of yellow fever when this<lb/>
species--and this species alone--is sufficiently controlled, it seems quite<lb/>
certain that in the Americas no other mosquito associated closely with<lb/>
man is a vector.</p>

prevalent within their lifetime (21). This confirms the epidemiological evidence<lb/>
that, in West Africa, yellow fever prevails among negroes as an unrecognized and<lb/>
perhaps clinically unrecognizable infection.</item>
<item>(8) <hi rend="italic">Relation of yellow fever to leptospiral jaundice.</hi> Yellow fever is clearly<lb/>
shown to be, in the nature of its virus, and in its pathology, quite distinct from the<lb/>
infection caused by <hi rend="italic">Leptospira icteroides</hi>, although leptospiral jaundice in man<lb/>
may be clinically almost indistinguishable from yellow fever (17, and others).</item>
</list></p>
<p>Since these and other observations made since 1925 in no way conflict with the<lb/>
view which Dr. Carter presents of the epidemiology of yellow fever, but tend, in<lb/>
general, to confirm inferences or conjectures previously lacking experimental<lb/>
proof, his discussion is presented without change, but with notes here and there<lb/>
calling attention to necessary modifications in certain statements of detail rather<lb/>
than principle. It is true that when Dr. Carter's discussion was written he was<lb/>
inclined to accept, though not without reservation, the evidence which seemed,<lb/>
at that time, to indicate <hi rend="italic">Leptospira icteroides</hi> as the specific cause of yellow fever.<lb/>
This, however, in no way modified his views of the fundamental epidemiology of<lb/>
the disease.</p>

<p>The causative organism may be (a) in men affected with yellow<lb/>

<p>Possibly one should add to the above: (4) &ldquo;A temperature suffi-<lb/>

ism in the mosquito.&rdquo; Certainly this development is necessary; and<lb/>
it is possible that the temperature required for it is in excess of the<lb/>
minimum required for the functional activity of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>. This has not<lb/>
been proved, however, and one is unwilling to introduce an extra condi-<lb/>

of the &ldquo;elimination of yellow fever by failure of the human host&rdquo; in the Americas<lb/>
is strong evidence that there is no such animal intimately associated with man in<lb/>
the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>tionally active <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, fails for a sufficient time, the micro-organism<lb/>
disappears and the disease will not reappear unless the micro-organism<lb/>
be reintroduced, even if the other two factors have reappeared in the<lb/>
meantime.</p>
<p>The limit of time necessary for the elimination of the micro-organism<lb/>
by the absence of active <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> or of susceptible men is the time the<lb/>
micro-organism can live in the host it is occupying without transference.</p>
<p>If it were <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> which were lacking, and the parasite existed only in<lb/>
men (or some other animal infective to <hi rend="italic">A. aegypti</hi>), this time would be so<lb/>
much of the period of incubation as had not yet elapsed, plus the time<lb/>
the man developing yellow fever was infective to mosquitoes--the sum<lb/>
certainly not in excess of two weeks, probably not over ten or eleven<lb/>
days. Nine days is about the sum of these maxima as they have been<lb/>
observed so far.</p>
<p>If the causative organism existed only in the mosquito, and it was the<lb/>
man susceptible to yellow fever who was lacking, the potential life of the<lb/>
micro-organism would be much longer. So far as we know, the insect,<lb/>
once infected, is infective as long as she lives and is active. The longest<lb/>
time recorded is, I think, fifty-seven days<hi rend="superscript">8</hi> in one of the Quemados cases<lb/>
(Reed, Carroll, and Agramonte, 1901).</p>
<p>Although an infected female mosquito has been kept alive five months<lb/>
in the laboratory, there is evidence that in nature mosquitoes cease to<lb/>
infect men--probably die--within two months of the destruction of<lb/>
their breeding places (Carter, H. R., 1922). It would seem, then, that<lb/>
three months would cover the ordinary limit in nature of the life of the<lb/>
parasite in the insect without change of host. Nevertheless, in the<lb/>
epidemiology of yellow fever the possibility of the occasional survival<lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in nature longer than the ordinary limit, or even as long as<lb/>
they have lived under laboratory conditions, must always be considered.<lb/>
Such insects, if infected, might give rise to cases of yellow fever long<lb/>
after the breeding places of the mosquito had been elimitated.</p>
<p>Note here that the limits of time given as sufficient for the elimina-<lb/>
tion of the causative organism are believed to be correct and conservative,<lb/>
yet it is not claimed that they are &ldquo;established&rdquo; in the same sense as<lb/>
the postulate which has been stated.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>THE SECOND FACTOR: ACTIVE A&Euml;DES AEGYPTI MOSQUITOES</p>
<p>By &ldquo;active&rdquo; is meant functioning biologically, capable of flight, feed-<lb/>
ing and propagating normally.<hi rend="superscript">9</hi></p>
<p>There are two conditions necessary for the continued existence of ac-<lb/>
tive <hi rend="italic">aegypti:</hi> (1) suitable breeding places and (2) suitable temperatures.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Breeding places. Aegypti</hi> breed in collections of water in artificial--<lb/>
man-made--containers, and in containers similar to them, close to, or in,<lb/>
the habitations of men. Their preference is for small or moderately<lb/>
sized collections of clear water, especially for wooden vessels or cala-<lb/>
bashes, in shady and somewhat dark places.</p>
<p>As to the material of the container, Dr. G. Jameson Carr, working at<lb/>
Parahyba, Brazil (unpublished report to International Health Board,<lb/>
1924), found that oviposition was decidedly greater in wooden containers<lb/>
than in either earthenware or metal, and greater in earthenware than in<lb/>
metal.<hi rend="superscript">10</hi> In some observations made by the writer, calabashes were<lb/>
preferred to wood.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Aegypti</hi> are, in the writer's opinion, and in that of the inspectors with<lb/>
whom he has worked, more often found in small collections of water<lb/>
than in large ones. This may not be a question of size, however. Small<lb/>
containers are more apt to be set in corners, and less apt to have been dis-</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">9</hi> Of course, if imagoes were continually introduced into a place where the<lb/>
conditions were such that they were capable of flight and feeding, yellow fever<lb/>
could be kept up by them even if there was no propagation. This, while possible,<lb/>
is a contingency that needs scarcely to be considered epidemiologically, as the<lb/>
cases in which the introduction of imagoes took place so continuously as to keep<lb/>
up the infection would be extremely rare. It might conceivably happen to some<lb/>
place just a little colder than Orizaba, in which the imago could feed, but not<lb/>
propagate, and in daily communication by train or vessel with a town infested<lb/>
with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>--especially if infected with yellow fever as well. I have no knowl<lb/>
edge that this has ever occurred.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">10</hi> One might naturally expect to find that the hydrogen-ion concentration would<lb/>
greatly influence the choice of water for oviposition, indeed that this might be the<lb/>
determining factor of the degree of preference shown for water-containers of differ-<lb/>
ent materials, the nature of the containers influencing the degree of concentration.<lb/>
Such investigation as has been made, however, does not seem to sustain this view.<lb/>
The limits of hydrogen-ion concentration reported compatible with free breeding<lb/>
are wide, and the writer is inclined to think that this factor is not of great impor-<lb/>
tance in the waters otherwise suitable for breeding, as they occur in nature. The<lb/>
free breeding of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">agua ceniza</hi> of the laundresses may imply a prefer-<lb/>
ence for alkaline waters; and the fact too that, in the writer's experience, breeding<lb/>
is not common in rusty iron containers, the water in which should be of the<lb/>
opposite reaction, points in the same direction.</p>

<p>covered and disturbed in the preceding inspection. Yet <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> have<lb/>
no objection to large bodies of water, being common, and occasionally<lb/>
abundant, in cisterns, etc. Indeed, as profuse breeding as the writer<lb/>
has seen, was in a cemented basement in a warehouse in Bahia, about<lb/>
20 &times; 35 feet, and a little less than 2 feet deep. The top was covered with<lb/>
loose boards with cracks between them.</p>
<p>Since the larvae of this species are essentially bottom feeders, one<lb/>
would expect that they would prefer rather shallow water (if the oviposit-<lb/>
ing imago can determine the depth) and would, in any case, do better in<lb/>
it. The writer knows of no comparative tests on this matter.</p>
<p>The writer has never seen breeding at a distance from human habi-<lb/>
tations, and, so far as he can recall, only a single instance of it has been<lb/>
reported (MacGregor, 1919).</p>
<p>The preference of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> for artificial containers and those similar to<lb/>
them--from a practical standpoint, one might almost say their limita-<lb/>
tion to them--is too well established and conceded to require discus-<lb/>
sion. It is, I think, the universal finding of all who have carefully inves-<lb/>
tigated the subject. I will take note of only one thing in this connection.<lb/>
Francis (1907), working at Mobile, states that &ldquo;they were not found<lb/>
breeding in any&rdquo; (collection of water with) &ldquo;natural earth bottoms.&rdquo;"<lb/>
The context shows that he meant puddles in the earth, &ldquo;mud puddles&rdquo;;<lb/>
and this observation, I am quite sure, is correct. It is, however, the<lb/>
nature of the <hi rend="italic">sides</hi> of the container <hi rend="italic">at the surface of the water,</hi> not of the<lb/>
bottom, which seems to determine the suitability for <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> breeding.</p>
<p>Slightly modifying Francis' statement, Dr. Henry Hanson (unpub-<lb/>
lished paper), on the basis of his Peruvian experience, says,<hi rend="superscript">11</hi> &ldquo;we have&rdquo;<lb/>
(in the Americas) &ldquo;found them&rdquo; (in nature) &ldquo;breeding&rdquo; (from oviposition<lb/>
to imago) &ldquo;in no collection of water with&rdquo; (exclusively) &ldquo;earth&rdquo; (i. e.,<lb/>
mud) &ldquo;sides&rdquo; (at the surface of the water). This is believed to be<lb/>
absolutely correct.<hi rend="superscript">12</hi> Certainly this has been our experience in Havana,</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">11</hi> The words in parentheses are added to Hanson's statement of the formula;<lb/>
but he evidently intended it as it is here more fully expressed.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">12</hi> The words &ldquo;in the Americas&rdquo; are introduced because the observations on<lb/>
which this statement is based were confined to the Americas. Recent observa-<lb/>
tions (reports sent from the British Colonial Office to the International Health<lb/>
Board, August 10, 1923) state that at Salt Pond, Gold Coast, West Africa, this<lb/>
mosquito breeds freely, and even profusely, in mud holes and the tracks of chil-<lb/>
dren in the mud around the Lagoon and in the Lagoon itself, when artificial con-<lb/>
tainers are not available. Breeding of this mosquito in the same class of places<lb/>
is implied, but only implied, in several official reports from this region, and appar-<lb/>
ently with artificial containers available. This matter is now under investiga-<lb/>
tion (personal communication from J. W. W. Stevens, 1924). Boyce (1910) states</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>wherever we have studied breeding habits in the United States, on the<lb/>
Isthmus, in Guayaquil, and in Peru.<hi rend="superscript">13</hi> In the latter country <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
were commonly found breeding freely in the large <hi rend="italic">botijas</hi> (earthenware<lb/>
jars about 5 feet high) with from 2 to 6 inches of pretty solid mud at the<lb/>
bottom--the sediment resulting from many fillings with muddy water;<lb/>
and in many shallow wells, the sides of which were of wood or brick.<lb/>
In wells with sides altogether of earth the larvae of other mosquitoes<lb/>
were found, but <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> never.</p>
<p>When we consider the method of oviposition, the insect standing at<lb/>
the very edge of the water, it seems reasonable that the nature of the<lb/>
side <hi rend="italic">at the surface of the water</hi>, rather than the bottom of the container,<lb/>
should influence her in the choice of a breeding place. Certainly this<lb/>
has been the case in my experience.</p>
<p>The occasional occurrence of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> larvae in street gutters and even</p>
<p>that he has seen breeding of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in pools on the mud tops of native houses<lb/>
in Africa. This observation is, I think, unique. They do breed in knot-holes in<lb/>
trees, hollows in rocks, etc., and in the water held in certain plants. These places<lb/>
are physically like their man-made breeding places. The last has, in my experi-<lb/>
ence, been used only when the usual breeding places were not available.</p>
<p>At Colon our inspectors, for a time in the spring of 1905, thought they had dis-<lb/>
covered breeding in crab holes, but the striped mosquitoes breeding in these holes<lb/>
were <hi rend="italic">Deinocerites caneronum</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>. Seeing how very important this ques-<lb/>
tion is for control work in Africa, further investigation seems advisable.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">13</hi> The matter has been further investigated quite recently, and some fifty reports<lb/>
of different men, mainly of the International Health Board staff, engaged in anti-<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi> work in different parts of Mexico, Central America, Colombia, the<lb/>
Guianas, and many parts of Brazil, state that the authors found no <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi><lb/>
breeding in nature from oviposition to imago in &ldquo;any collecton of water, all the<lb/>
sides of which at the water's level are of mud.&rdquo; Carr at Parahyba, however, was<lb/>
able, by confining the insects in a cage of wire netting, to get oviposition well<lb/>
above the surface of the water in a cavity in sand, where the sand was wet by<lb/>
capillarity, the larvae hatching and crawling down into the water (unpublished<lb/>
report to International Health Board, Rockefeller Foundation, by Dr. G. Jameson<lb/>
Carr, 1924).</p>
<p>Breeding is reported, too, as common in the small collections of water in<lb/>
cocoanut palms on the east coast of Africa (Haworth, 1924) and in the axils of<lb/>
leaves of <hi rend="italic">Dracaena</hi> and other plants in Sierra Leone, etc., by the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Commission (West African) (1915). Breeding in the axils of the leaves of certain<lb/>
plants, as in knot-holes in trees, and in holes in rocks, was common enough on<lb/>
the Isthmus, although not enough imagoes were so produced that we regarded it<lb/>
of sanitary importance: the first, too, only when water in artificial containers was<lb/>
not available. This class of container, however, is that which the writer (Carter,<lb/>
1924-a) proposed to include as &ldquo;similar&rdquo; to artificial containers.</p>

<p>pools in the street, has been noted (LePrince and Orenstein, 1916, pp.<lb/>
55 and 240; Carter, 1924-a; and others), but usually under conditions<lb/>
which have led the observer to believe that the larvae had been washed<lb/>
down into the place where found, from roof gutters and other such places<lb/>
which were, in effect, artificial containers. In no case were these larvae<lb/>
in sufficient numbers to be of sanitary importance.<hi rend="superscript">14</hi></p>
<p>The presence of puddles in the streets, or ponds and marshy places in<lb/>
vacant lots, and the absence of sufficient sewerage and drainage in a<lb/>
town, all of which have been mentioned as very insanitary from the<lb/>
standpoint of yellow fever production,<hi rend="superscript">15</hi> have no effect whatever on the<lb/>
production of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the storage of drinking water about the houses,<lb/>
in cisterns, jars, or any other receptacle, does favor their breeding mark-<lb/>
edly. In towns with no water supply in pipes, or with an insufficient<lb/>
one, where the people depend on conserving rain-water or the purchase<lb/>
of water from itinerant vendors, water must be stored in containers<lb/>
about the houses, and such furnish ideal breeding places for <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>.<lb/>
Many a town has been freed of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> (and of yellow fever) by the<lb/>
introduction of a piped water supply, and the consequent doing away<lb/>
with the domestic storage of water. The need of storage is greater<lb/>
as the difficulty of obtaining water increases; thus it happens that the<lb/>
very scarcity of water--generally supposed to be a protection against<lb/>
all mosquitoes--inevitably leads to the production of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in the towns<lb/>
and villages of such a country.</p>
<p>For the water in which they breed, we would say that the preference<lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> is for clear, not necessarily clean, water. They are fairly<lb/>
adaptable about this, however, and will breed in muddy water, and<lb/>
even in somewhat brackish water. They breed freely in water to which</p>

on the outskirts of New Orleans, reported by the Mosquito Commission of New<lb/>
Orleans (Beyer, Pothier, <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1902) is possibly referred to in the explanation given<lb/>
by Howard, Dyar, and Knab (1912-17, vol. i, p. 284): &ldquo;It would seem that in<lb/>
these cases the larvae were not bred and most probably they were those of some<lb/>
other species of A&euml;des, many of which greatly resemble <hi rend="italic">calopus</hi>&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>) &ldquo;in<lb/>
general appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be noted, however, that many of the street gutters of New Orleans have<lb/>
their sides lined with cypress boards. Otherwise this finding of the writers cited<lb/>
above would be most unusual.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">15</hi> Boyce (1911, p. 26): &ldquo;Puddles formed everywhere, for there was no proper<lb/>

<p>wood ashes have been added--the <hi rend="italic">agua ceniza</hi> of the laundresses of<lb/>

<p><hi rend="italic">Temperature</hi>. The limits of temperature for the functional activity--<lb/>
breeding and feeding--of this mosquito are usually given from 68&deg; to<lb/>
102.5&deg;F. The optimum is from 80&deg; to 87&deg;F. The lower limit is set by<lb/>
that necessary for <hi rend="italic">breeding</hi>, since they feed--and may be able to transmit<lb/>
yellow fever--at a temperature below the inferior limit (68&deg;F.) set for<lb/>
breeding.<hi rend="superscript">17</hi> The Pasteur Commission (Marchoux, Salimbeni, and<lb/>
Simond, 1903), working at Rio, found 64&deg;F. (18&deg;C.) as the lower limit</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">16</hi> The control of breeding in the <hi rend="italic">agua ceniza</hi> has been a troublesome problem.<lb/>
It is too valuable to be thrown out. Oil and other larvicides render it worthless,<lb/>
and any attempt to get rid of it or lessen its value to the laundress leads to its<lb/>
concealment. In northern Peru, in 1920 and 1921, the writer controlled the pro-<lb/>
duction of imagoes in the <hi rend="italic">agua ceniza</hi> by adding soap to it. This, of course, was<lb/>
not objected to and it was entirely successful. A saturated alcoholic solution of<lb/>
soap was used, but it was the soap that killed the larvae, not the alcohol. It has<lb/>
since been used with success in Mexico, Yucatan, and Brazil. Soap as a larvicide<lb/>
is mentioned by Howard, Dyar, and Knab (<hi rend="italic">loc. cit</hi>., vol. i, pp. 290-291).</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">17</hi> It has been suggested that the parasites in the insect host may perhaps be<lb/>
killed or rendered inactive by a fall of temperature to a point well above the<lb/>
minimum necessary for the functional activity of the mosquito. Data, epidemio-<lb/>
logical or experimental, are lacking on this subject, yet they might not be difficult<lb/>
to obtain. The analogy with malaria and Rocky Mountain fever, for which a<lb/>
similar thing is proven, is suggestive. The prolongation of the development of<lb/>
infectivity in <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> as the temperature is lowered, while still high enough for the<lb/>
mosquito's functional activity, also seems to imply that a higher temperature is<lb/>
required for the development (or it may be for the existence) of the causative<lb/>
organism in the vector than for that of the insect itself.</p>
<p>It may be, then, that there are border-line places and times in which the insect<lb/>
can function, but in which it is too cold for the causative organism to develop in<lb/>
her. Thus, in Mexico City, from <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> larvae received July 24 and August 8<lb/>
from the low country, Fernando Lopez (1905) developed imagoes which were func-<lb/>
tionally active--flying, feeding on man, and laying eggs from which other imagoes<lb/>
were developed. These, however, did not oviposit, although they lived to Decem-<lb/>
ber 1 and fed. Connor, too, reports the presence of the insect in Mexico City<lb/>
(personal communication, 1922, from Dr. M. E. Connor). Yet with the many<lb/>
introductions of men infected with yellow fever into Mexico City (and developing<lb/>
it there) we have no report of its having been propagated from them. The reason<lb/>
may have been that the temperature was too low for the development of the causa-<lb/>
tive organism in the mosquito, although high enough for the functional activity<lb/>
of the insect. Certainly the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tierra fria</hi>&rdquo; of Mexico is historically uninfectible<lb/>
territory, although functional activity of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> may sometimes be possible.</p>

<p>of temperature for feeding; Reed's Commission (Reed and Carroll,<lb/>
1901) at Quemados placed it at 62&deg;F.; Hanson, in Peru (personal com-<lb/>
munication from Dr. Henry Hanson, 1921), found <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> &ldquo;active and<lb/>
feeding in the evenings&rdquo; at 17&deg;C. (62.6&deg;F.) in nature. Similarly, for the<lb/>
upper limit, Marchoux, Salimbeni, and Simond (1903) found heat above<lb/>
39&deg;C. (102.2&deg;F.) fatal to imagoes. Macfie (1920), applying heat for<lb/>
five minutes only, and with abundant moisture, found them &ldquo;fairly<lb/>
active at 39&deg;C.; profoundly affected, but not completely inactivated at<lb/>
40&deg;C.&rdquo; (104&deg;F.). They were more susceptible to heat if abundant<lb/>
moisture was not supplied. It would seem fair, then, to set the limits<lb/>
of temperature for such functional activity as would be of sanitary<lb/>
importance, that is, as would continue the existence of yellow fever<lb/>
under ordinary circumstances, at from about 72&deg;F. to 101&deg; or 101.5&deg;F.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is implied that these temperatures are the ones to which<lb/>
the insects themselves are exposed--which may be very different from<lb/>
outside temperatures--and for some time.<hi rend="superscript">18</hi> A drop below 72&deg;F. or even<lb/>
lower for a few days would not eliminate <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, nor would a temporary<lb/>
rise to 102&deg;F. A rise above 102.5&deg;F., to which they were exposed for<lb/>
some time, would probably kill off the majority of the imagoes. With<lb/>
the upper limit, however, we are not, in practice, much concerned (see<lb/>
page 40, footnote 1); but as to the lower limit, it is safe to say that an<lb/>
outside temperature of about 70&deg; to 72&deg;F., long continued, would be<lb/>
incompatible with the existence of yellow fever; especially in &ldquo;yellow<lb/>
fever&rdquo; countries, in which the houses are open and fires, except for<lb/>
cooking, are a rarity, <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> would not breed at this temperature in<lb/>
sufficient number to continue the fever for long.<hi rend="superscript">19</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">18</hi> LePrince has recently reported (personal communications from Mr. J. A.<lb/>
LePrince, January 21 and March 20, 1922) finding <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> reproducing and feeding<lb/>
in a hotel at Carbondale, Illinois, on January 19 and March 15, 1922. They &ldquo;were<lb/>
breeding in the writing-room in one of the containers in which flower-pots were<lb/>
set.&rdquo; The outdoor temperature at this place must have been as low as 10&deg;F. or<lb/>
5&deg;F. at times during the winter. Winter breeding of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, even in well-warmed<lb/>
houses, is, however, altogether exceptional. The writer knows of no similar case.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">19</hi> Finlay (1912) states that of imagoes developed near the lower temperature<lb/>
limit of breeding the proportion of males to females is about five to one; the<lb/>
proportion in hot weather is reversed. I have been unable to verify this, but, if<lb/>
true, the chance of continuing the fever is still further lessened near the inferior<lb/>
temperature limit of breeding by this as well as by slower oviposition and a much<lb/>
longer cycle of development from oviposition to the imago. Cavassa (1922), of<lb/>
Guadalupe, Peru, also finds males developed in excess in cool, and females in warm,<lb/>
weather. Further observation is needed before this can be considered established<lb/>
as a generalization.</p>
<pb n="16" id="Cb000030"/>
<p>16<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>Mosquitoes already infective might continue to convey yellow fever<lb/>
as long as they fed, as has often occurred among families returning to<lb/>
town &ldquo;after the end of the epidemic.&rdquo; If, under these circumstances,<lb/>
an insect received infection from a man thus infected with yellow fever,<lb/>
she might even become infective and convey the disease. The period<lb/>
of extrinsic incubation, however, would be extremely long, and in the<lb/>
towns in the United States where this would be most apt to occur, the<lb/>
increasing cold would probably kill the mosquito before she became<lb/>
infective. Secondary cases in these returning families must be of<lb/>
extreme rarity. I do not know that any have been reported.</p>
<p>The imago dies quickly at freezing point. Flu (1920) states that at<lb/>
or below 6&deg;C. (42.8&deg;F.) none lived twenty-four hours. At 7&deg; to 10&deg;C.<lb/>
(44.6&deg; to 50&deg;F.) they are &ldquo;immediately benumbed, but not past revival<lb/>
until four days afterwards.&rdquo; The larvae, in nature, are somewhat more<lb/>
resistant than the imago. This is indicated by observations in nature<lb/>
rather than by experiment; thus, Francis (1907) found larvae during<lb/>
every month at Mobile, although there was an occasional formation of<lb/>
ice in shallow water, and no imagoes were observed in winter.</p>
<p>The insect hibernates--where it does hibernate--in the egg form.<lb/>
The eggs are laid above water, or at the very edge of the water, and left<lb/>
on the sides of the container as the water goes down. Dried, they may<lb/>
retain their viability a long time; Francis (1907) has found them to<lb/>
remain viable for six and one-half months, and Bacot (1918), for over<lb/>
eight months. MacGregor (1915) reported some still viable after having<lb/>
been carried from the west coast of Africa to England, adhering to<lb/>
dried leaves. In this stage the insects are more resistant to low tem-<lb/>
perature than in the larval or imago stage. The eggs will hatch after<lb/>
freezing a short time; Reed and Carroll (1901), indeed, hatched a<lb/>
number after exposing them an hour to -- 17&deg;C. (1.4&deg;F.). Prolonged low<lb/>
temperature, however, is reported as greatly diminishing their viability.<lb/>
Marchoux, Salimbeni, and Simond (1903) state that &ldquo;the degree of the<lb/>
nocturnal temperature&rdquo; (i.e. the minimum daily temperature) &ldquo;exercises<lb/>
the greatest influence&rdquo; (as retarding) &ldquo;on the functional activity of<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi>,&rdquo; and this has been confirmed by other observers. They<lb/>
were able to hatch out scarcely 5 per cent of eggs exposed for seventy<lb/>
days to a natural night temperature of from 10&deg; to 20&deg;C. (50&deg; to 68&deg;F.).<lb/>
They &ldquo;believe consequently that all eggs submitted to chilling would<lb/>
probably perish at the end of several months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only observation the writer can find on the minimum death<lb/>
point for eggs on short exposure is unsatisfactory. Peryass&uacute; (1908, p.<lb/>
<pb n="17" id="Cb000031"/>
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
17<lb/>
397) states that eggs exposed in a mixture of salt and ice for one-half<lb/>
hour do not develop. He does not report, however, either the tempera-<lb/>
ture of the mixture or the number of observations on which this conclu
sion is based. One would much like to know, because it might give us<lb/>
a clue to the northern limit of the viability of this species during the<lb/>
winter.</p>
<p>From the finding of Marchoux, Salimbeni, and Simond, quoted above,<lb/>
it would seem improbable that the species would survive the ordinary<lb/>
winter of Norfolk, Virginia, for example, or even farther south. In<lb/>
point of fact, they do survive it, and were found in the small towns and<lb/>
villages near by, where there were suitable breeding places, into which<lb/>
their introduction yearly from vessels had been impossible. It may be<lb/>
that their chances of survival are greatly increased by house breeding, or<lb/>
that the above finding is not of universal, maybe not of general,<lb/>
applicability.</p>
<p>THE THIRD FACTOR: THE MAN SUSCEPTIBLE TO YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>In the formula which has been given for the mechanism of the con-<lb/>
veyance of yellow fever, the presence of men susceptible to that disease<lb/>
and accessible to infective mosquitoes is included as a necessary condi-<lb/>
tion for the continuation of this infection. This is definitely stated as a<lb/>
postulate. That this is so depends on the premises: (1) that the causa-<lb/>
tive organism has no host other than man which is infective to the<lb/>
insect vector and is of sanitary importance; (2) that there is no free-<lb/>
living stage of this organism infective to man or to the mosquito; (3)<lb/>
that man is infective to the insect but a short time--that is, he does<lb/>
not become a carrier or reservoir host; (4) that he acquires immunity<lb/>
to the infection by the attack.</p>
<p>All of these propositions are believed to be true. For all there is<lb/>
good evidence--of necessity negative--for some, amounting to proof;<lb/>
and, except possibly the third, all are very generally accepted.<hi rend="superscript">20</hi></p>
<p>Accepting them then: when, in any community, men susceptible to<lb/>
yellow fever are not accessible to yellow fever mosquitoes, the life-cycle<lb/>
of the causative organism is broken; and when the parasite in the mos-<lb/>
quitoes already infected dies--probably with or soon after the death of<lb/>
the insect--the infection in this community ceases. The presence, then,</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">20</hi> In my judgment the negation of human carriers infective to <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> rests upon<lb/>
evidence which is very strong, although necessarily negative; and no single ob-<lb/>
servation as evidence to the contrary has come to my notice (Carter, 1916).</p>
<pb n="18" id="Cb000032"/>
<p>18<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>of men susceptible to yellow fever and accessible to infective <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> is an<lb/>
essential factor in the continuance of that disease.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mechanism of the spontaneous elimination of yellow fever</hi>. Very<lb/>
obviously, continuance of yellow fever in a community will lessen the<lb/>
number of people susceptible to that disease--each one attacked becom-<lb/>
ing immune to it, at least temporarily--and when this continuance has<lb/>
reached such a degree that no <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> infective with yellow fever has<lb/>
access to the man susceptible to yellow fever, the disease will cease.<lb/>
This the writer (Carter, 1917) has called &ldquo;the spontaneous elimination<lb/>
of yellow fever by failure of the human host,&rdquo; and it has been of quite<lb/>
common occurrence, even where, from temperature conditions and the<lb/>
customs of the people, <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> continue active during the whole year.</p>
<p>Since not only the presence of men susceptible to yellow fever is<lb/>
requisite for the continuance of that disease, but these men must also be<lb/>
accessible to infective mosquitoes, this elimination of yellow fever may<lb/>
take place even with a considerable number of susceptible men remain-<lb/>
ing, none of them being bitten by infective mosquitoes. Such mos-<lb/>
quitoes in the neighborhood of these men may be few, on account of a lack<lb/>
of many sick men to infect them or from a general reduction in the<lb/>
number of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in the neighborhood of these men. Naturally, too,<lb/>
the number of people immune to these mosquitoes lessens the chance of<lb/>
the susceptible ones being bitten. Under the doctrine of chances, then,<lb/>
it is easy to see that a considerable number of susceptible men might be<lb/>
in such a community and yet none of them be bitten by an infective<lb/>
mosquito.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Critical number</hi>&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">of aegypti</hi>. Obviously, it is not necessary to<lb/>
exterminate <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in order to eliminate yellow fever from an infected<lb/>
place. If the number of mosquitoes be brought below the &ldquo;critical<lb/>
number&rdquo; for yellow fever--an idea we owe to Ross as applied to<lb/>
malaria, and extended to yellow fever by Gorgas (1908)--at that<lb/>
place, the disease will die out. Note, too, that this &ldquo;critical number&rdquo;<lb/>
for any place will vary directly as the proportion of men immune to<lb/>
yellow fever in the total population: thus, if with one hundred cases of<lb/>
yellow fever introduced into a community in which all were susceptible<lb/>
to yellow fever, the number of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> were such that exactly one hun-<lb/>
dred men would be infected from these cases, the disease would neither<lb/>
die out nor increase. This would be the &ldquo;critical number&rdquo; of aegypti<lb/>
for that place and time. With less mosquitoes than this, less than one<lb/>
hundred men would be infected, and the fever would die out. With<lb/>
more mosquitoes, more than one hundred men would be infected, and<lb/>
<pb n="19" id="Cb000033"/>
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
19<lb/>
it would increase. Now if one-fourth of the inhabitants were immune<lb/>
to yellow fever, obviously the same number of mosquitoes which infected<lb/>
one hundred men before would now infect only seventy-five--one-<lb/>
fourth of their bites going to immunes, and hence being wasted--and<lb/>
at this rate the disease would die out. The number of mosquitoes<lb/>
required to infect the one hundred men, and hence just perpetuate the<lb/>
fever, would have to be increased by one-third above the first number.</p>
<p>Obviously then, this critical number, below which the <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> must be<lb/>
brought to eliminate fever, is less in a community as the proportion of<lb/>
susceptible people increases. Obviously, also the number of susceptible<lb/>
men in a community compatible with the elimination of yellow fever by<lb/>
&ldquo;the failure of the human host&rdquo; varies inversely, more or less, with the<lb/>
number of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in flight.</p>
<p>Obviously again, the expression &ldquo;community&rdquo; must be understood<lb/>
in a restricted sense, as denoting the people who are in sanitary com-<lb/>
munication with each other. As Connor and Monroe (1923) have noted,<lb/>
the critical number of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> for the residence district for natives of an<lb/>
endemic center may be very different from that of hotels and lodging<lb/>
houses. In the first, the great bulk of the people are immune to yellow<lb/>
fever; in the second, susceptible strangers congregate. One should not,<lb/>
then, in general, predicate a critical index for a town as a whole. In<lb/>
the above sense a town is, or may be, a number of communities, each<lb/>
one having a different critical index.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Proportion of immunizations to supply of susceptibles.</hi> Naturally, the<lb/>
occurrence of this elimination will depend on the proportion of the<lb/>
number of people immunized to the number of susceptible people intro-<lb/>
duced in the same time. The former depends on the number of cases of<lb/>
yellow fever; the second is the sum of the babies born in the community,<lb/>
the susceptible immigration thereto, and the number--if any--of<lb/>
immune people losing their immunity to yellow fever.</p>
<p>The possibility of the elimination of yellow fever by the above<lb/>
mechanism does not depend on the permanence of the immunity ac-<lb/>
quired by an attack, so long as it is absolute and of a considerable dura-<lb/>
tion. The men who lost their immunity would simply be equivalent to<lb/>
the same number of susceptible immigrants. The chance of elimination<lb/>
taking place and the time necessary for it to occur, do, however, depend<lb/>
on the <hi rend="italic">duration</hi> of immunity--the chance being greatest and the time<lb/>
least when immunity is permanent. The fact that spontaneous elimina-<lb/>
tion is so common is a strong argument against the frequency of recur-<lb/>
<pb n="20" id="Cb000034"/>
20<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
rent attacks.<hi rend="superscript">21</hi> Obviously, in large towns, both from the number of<lb/>
babies born and the greater immigration, elimination would be less apt<lb/>
to occur or would take longer than in small or moderate sized ones and,<lb/>
in the latter, the spontaneous elimination of yellow fever as a fact,<lb/>
without regard to its mechanism, has been a common occurrence, even<lb/>
in the tropics and with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> abundant. It has disappeared from<lb/>
Cartagena, Barranquilla, Maracaibo, C&uacute;cuta (towns of from 20,000 to<lb/>
75,000 people); from all of Hayti and Santo Domingo; from Porto Rico,<lb/>
St. Thomas, and a host of smaller places; and this without any sanitary<lb/>
work and with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> abundant. It did not disappear spontaneously<lb/>
from Havana, Rio de Janeiro, Guayaquil, or Panama. The first three<lb/>
are large towns and all with large susceptible (European) immigration.<hi rend="superscript">22</hi></p>
<p>For reasons which it would take too long to develop, while a sufficient<lb/>
number either of babies or of susceptible immigrants should be able to<lb/>
continue yellow fever, yet the proportional effect of the same number of<lb/>
each in so doing is different--decidedly more babies being required than<lb/>
adult immigrants (see Carter, 1917). The size of the community, then,<lb/>
is less important than the amount of susceptible adult immigration.<lb/>
Both factors are, in practice, apt to increase together, as large towns<lb/>
generally receive much immigration.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Conditions of regional endemicity</hi>. Besides large towns, and towns<lb/>
receiving susceptible immigration, there are certain communities of small<lb/>
places between which the travel relations are so close that they must<lb/>
be held, for this mechanism, as a single large community. Indeed, in<lb/>
such a group of interrelated places, the propagation of yellow fever would<lb/>
be decidedly slower than in the single larger town, and hence elimination<lb/>
of yellow fever therefrom might take longer and be less apt to occur<lb/>
than in a single town equal to them in population. Such a section<lb/>
is Yucatan and Campeche, the large sisal <hi rend="italic">haciendas</hi> being, indeed, towns;</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">21</hi> The presence of lower animals susceptible to yellow fever, if immunity is pro-<lb/>
duced in them by one attack, is simply equivalent to adding approximately the<lb/>
same number of susceptible men to our population. If, however, such animals<lb/>
were <hi rend="italic">permanent reservoir</hi> hosts--as some are of trypanosomes--and infective to<lb/>
mosquitoes, the infection would persist.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">22</hi> This principle, with the facts on which it is based, was first presented in lec-<lb/>
tures to a class of student officers at the Hygienic Laboratory of the U. S. Public<lb/>
Health Service in March, 1914 (Carter, 1914), and was elaborated in subsequent<lb/>
papers (Carter, 1917 and 1920). It was accepted by the Yellow Fever Commission<lb/>
of the International Health Board at Guayaquil, 1916, as determining the basis of<lb/>
measures proposed for the elimination of yellow fever from the west coast of<lb/>
South America, and is now generally accepted as a recognized principle in the epi-<lb/>
demiology and control of yellow fever.</p>

<p>and this section did not free itself from yellow fever, but was a perma-<lb/>
nent endemic focus of the disease, apparently needing sanitation for its<lb/>
elimination.<hi rend="superscript">23</hi> Control of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> breeding was accordingly undertaken<lb/>
and is still going on at Merida, and this region is believed now (May,<lb/>
1922) to be free from yellow fever.<hi rend="superscript">24</hi></p>
<p>Similarly there have been--one is glad indeed to use the past tense--<lb/>
large regions forming what may be called permanent endemic regional<lb/>
foci. Such was that of the south shore of the Caribbean and the Lesser<lb/>
Antilles. Possibly either one, the south shore of the Caribbean or the<lb/>
islands, in the times of sailing ships and naval activity in the Caribbean,<lb/>
had sufficient intercommunication and ingress of susceptible people to<lb/>
propagate the infection in permanence. Possibly later--since about<lb/>
1880, say--reinfections from Vera Cruz, Havana, and Panama, all of<lb/>
which were then infected, and through all of which passed much sus-<lb/>
ceptible travel, may have been necessary to continue it. At any rate,<lb/>
yellow fever existed in this region from early times up to and including<lb/>
1917. We called this a &ldquo;permanent regional focus,&rdquo; because yellow<lb/>
fever existed at some place in it at all times; and from such infected<lb/>
places other places in the region were infected from time to time.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">23</hi> The idea that a number of small communities, each one too small by itself to<lb/>
remain permanently infected, in such travel relation with each other that the<lb/>
whole forms a permanent endemic focus of yellow fever--a &ldquo;regional focus,&rdquo; it<lb/>
was called--was, he thinks, first formulated by the writer in 1917 (Carter, 1917),<lb/>
using Yucatan with its sisal <hi rend="italic">haciendas</hi> as an illustration. Guiteras noted the<lb/>
same condition in the sugar district of Coro, Venezuela, in 1917 (unpublished re-<lb/>
port on the Yellow Fever Situation at Coro, Venezuela, submitted to the Yellow<lb/>
Fever Commission, Rockefeller Foundation, October, 1917. See also Guiteras,<lb/>
1921, for published reference) as did Connor (1923) in the sugar district of the<lb/>
Papaloapan River, calling it--I think quoting Guiteras--&ldquo;hacienda endemicity.&rdquo;<lb/>
It is but a special instance of the &ldquo;permanent regional focus&rdquo; with haciendas as<lb/>
the small community units.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">24</hi> Whether the collapse of the sisal industry, following as it did upon the whole-<lb/>
sale immunization of the inhabitants by the great increase of fever, due to the<lb/>
advent of susceptible troops during the political disturbances, would have been by<lb/>
itself sufficient for the elimination of yellow fever from this region, may be a ques-<lb/>
tion. Connor, in charge of the sanitary work there, thinks it would have been,<lb/>
indeed that it possibly had eliminated the disease before <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> control was<lb/>
undertaken.</p>
<p>Still, when yellow fever is at a low ebb from lack of susceptible people, as natur-<lb/>
ally follows a general epidemic, is the time of all others when work against <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
should be pressed. A very small reduction of mosquitoes then may be sufficient<lb/>
to eliminate infection. For it to be lessened does no permanent good; eliminated,<lb/>
however, it is gone forever, unless reintroduced.</p>
<pb n="22" id="Cb000036"/>
<p>22<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>Before one place had freed itself by failure of the human host it would<lb/>
infect another which had a sufficient number of susceptible men for fever<lb/>
to propagate for some time, to be itself reinfected when time enough<lb/>
had elapsed for it to accumulate susceptible men. Yellow fever was<lb/>
thus always present at some place in this region.</p>
<p>Evidently, in such a regional focus, as well as in one formed by a<lb/>
series of smaller places, the nature and amount of the intertravel are<lb/>
prime factors in the permanence or disappearance of yellow fever.<lb/>
There is, speaking generally, this contrast between a permanent regional<lb/>
focus and a permanently infected town. In the latter the parasites, in<lb/>
infected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, are always present, and the infection is kept up by the<lb/>
advent of susceptible men; in the former, susceptible men and unin-<lb/>
fected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> are always present in some part, and the infection is kept<lb/>
up (counting the regional focus as a whole) by introducing the parasite<lb/>
into such places by the advent of infected men from other parts of the<lb/>
region. In the one, the parasites (in infected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>) are in perma-<lb/>
nence; in the other, they are carried (in infected men) from one part of<lb/>
the region to another. If, however, we consider each house or little<lb/>
district in a city as a community unit, there is really little difference in<lb/>
the essentials of the above.<hi rend="superscript">25</hi></p>
<p>The west coast of Africa formed a similar regional focus, apparently<lb/>
permanent, but the continuance of this in recent times was doubtless<lb/>
assisted by occasional reinfections from America, principally from<lb/>
Havana, the French Antilles, and the Brazilian ports. Some <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
control work has been done in West Africa. It is reported as small in<lb/>
amount, and although it has been done at strategic points, as Sierra<lb/>
Leone, Lagos, and others, it does not seem to have been enough seriously<lb/>
to affect the existence of the African focus. Yet during and since the<lb/>
war there seems to have been a marked diminution of yellow fever in<lb/>
Africa, and Guiteras (1921-b) hopes that this great regional focus has<lb/>
also disappeared. His observation was in October, 1920; and to date<lb/>
(July, 1922) the writer finds no report of definite occurrence of yellow</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">25</hi> No work sufficient seriously to affect the general prevalence of yellow fever<lb/>
has been done in the region referred to--the south shore of the Caribbean and Les-<lb/>
ser Antilles--and yet, with the removal of the chance of reinfection from Vera<lb/>
Cruz, Havana, and Panama, the diminution of immigration and of intertravel due<lb/>
to the Great War, and some sanitary work at Coro, in 1917 and 1918, possibly giv-<lb/>
ing it the <hi rend="italic">coup de grace</hi>, yellow fever seems to have disappeared from this great<lb/>
regional focus. The last report of it was around Coro, Venezuela, in 1917, by<lb/>
Guiteras (1921a: also in unpublished report to Yellow Fever Commission, Rocke-<lb/>
feller Foundation, October, 1917).</p>
<pb n="23" id="Cb000037"/>

<p>fever in Africa since that time. There were cases, however, on the<lb/>
Gold Coast in 1919, and quite a number in 1917 and 1918. Hence,<lb/>
much as the writer would like to agree, he is afraid to accept the tenta-<lb/>
tive opinion of Guiteras until a decidedly longer time has elapsed and<lb/>
there has been a complete restoration of the European communications<lb/>
which were seriously interrupted by the war. It is much more difficult<lb/>
to determine the existence of yellow fever, or to make sure that it does<lb/>
not exist, in Africa than in America;<hi rend="superscript">26</hi> and if the disease shows again<lb/>
within a few years, we may not be able to say whether it is a recrud-<lb/>
escence of the old infection or a reintroduction from America--as<lb/>
from Brazil.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">26</hi> Guiteras (1921) has suggested that the great mortality of malarial fever re-<lb/>
ported in West Africa in excess of that in America and India, may have been due to<lb/>
the inclusion, under that diagnosis, of cases of yellow fever. Some British observ-<lb/>
ers, on the contrary, have been inclined to think that a number of the cases re-<lb/>
ported as yellow fever in West Africa have been severe malaria, and to doubt that<lb/>
there has been any yellow fever on this coast for a number of years. Several other<lb/>
British writers have also expressed grave doubts as to the recent existence of yel-<lb/>
low fever on this coast. The writer cannot think that this opinion rests on a<lb/>
sufficient basis--i.e. the non-report of yellow fever for a few years in West Africa.<lb/>
He will be very glad to acknowledge his error if mistaken.</p>

<head>DISPERSION AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF A&Euml;DES AEGYPTI</head>
<pb n="24" id="Cb000038"/>
<p>I have spoken of the conditions--temperature and the nature and<lb/>
location of breeding places--necessary for a supply, continuous or inter-<lb/>
mittent, of active <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, but naturally the first condition is the presence<lb/>
of the mosquito itself to begin a generation.</p>
<p>MECHANISM OF DISPERSION OF A&Euml;DES AEGYPTI</p>
<p>Whatever the origin of <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des aegypti</hi>, its habits are such that it would<lb/>
be widely distributed by human agency, and in point of fact, it is now of<lb/>
very wide distribution. Some of this extension we can trace in historic<lb/>
times; much of it we cannot. It is obvious from what has been said of<lb/>
its breeding habits, that the conditions obtaining on sailing vessels in<lb/>
hot climates were well fitted for its distribution. Drinking-water in<lb/>
artificial containers, accessible to the mosquito and in proximity to man,<lb/>
make such a vessel well-nigh an ideal breeding place for <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> and,<lb/>
seeded at some port in which the species existed, the vessel, thus acting<lb/>
as a host, would carry them to other ports. At such ports, if <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
went ashore and if the conditions there were suitable for propagation--<lb/>
artificial containers and proper temperature--they might form a colony,<lb/>
possibly a permanent colony, from which further distribution could<lb/>
take place.</p>
<p>At a port where there were no places suitable for breeding, no colony<lb/>
could be established--only the insects which left the vessel would be<lb/>
present, and they only until they died out. The same would be true<lb/>
if the temperature was too low for oviposition when the insects came<lb/>
ashore: there would be no colony established; those that came ashore<lb/>
would die, and in this case, we think, quickly.</p>
<p>If breeding places were available and the temperature on landing high<lb/>
enough for the full functional activity of the insects, a colony could be<lb/>
established and would be permanent or not, according to the winter<lb/>
temperature of the locality, and the colony would last until the species<lb/>
(eggs) were destroyed by the cold, which might be the first winter; or, in<lb/>
border-line places, the species might live several years, to be destroyed<lb/>
eventually by some winter of unusual length or severity. Such seems to<lb/>
have been the case in Philadelphia and possibly New York in the latter<lb/>
24<lb/>
<pb n="25" id="Cb000039"/>
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
25<lb/>
part of the eighteenth century. In many places conditions have been<lb/>
only too favorable to the propagation of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, and there is no question<lb/>
but that distribution by man has been a determining factor in their dis-<lb/>
semination. Wherever they may have originated, they are now found<lb/>
in every seaport and large river port in the world in which the conditions<lb/>
are suitable for their propagation.</p>
<p>Steamboats plying on large rivers are only less efficient hosts for breed-<lb/>
ing and distribution than the sailing vessels of which we have spoken,<lb/>
and they have carried <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> inland--certainly up the Mississippi and<lb/>
its branches--from the ports nearest the sea. We have strong evidence,<lb/>
indeed proof, that there were no considerable number of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, if any,<lb/>
in Memphis as late as 1853, or in the towns on Red River in 1847 or<lb/>
previously.</p>
<p>Transferring of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> by railroad coaches has not been directly<lb/>
observed, but the evidence that it has occurred in both the United States<lb/>
and Mexico is convincing. This would be, of course, merely a mechan-<lb/>
ical transfer of individual insects. They would very rarely, if ever,<lb/>
breed aboard the coaches as on vessels.</p>
<p>The habit which the insect has, especially in slightly cool weather, of<lb/>
resting on one's clothing (the writer has seen them hiding under the<lb/>
lapel of his coat) is doubtless also an occasional, though rare, method of<lb/>
dissemination. At any rate, <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> were of quite general distribution<lb/>
in 1898 at farmhouses in northern Mississippi, well off from the railroad,<lb/>
while in previous epidemics (1867 and 1868) such places had been<lb/>
clearly non-infectible with yellow fever--that is, had no considerable<lb/>
infestation. This, to the writer, seems a possible, and a reasonably<lb/>
probable, explanation for the infection of Dr. Chaillon, &ldquo;the physician<lb/>
of Montoir,&rdquo; as reported by M&eacute;lier (1863) in his account of the celebrated<lb/>
epidemic of St. Nazaire, 1861.</p>
<p>A vessel, the <hi rend="italic">Anne-Marie</hi>, from Havana for St. Nazaire, developed<lb/>
some cases of yellow fever aboard, in Havana and en route, but arrived<lb/>
at her destination and docked with no one sick aboard. The crew was<lb/>
immediately discharged, and the cargo (of sugar) was unloaded by<lb/>
stevedores. Within a few days cases of yellow fever began to develop,<lb/>
in the officer who supervised the unloading, in stevedores and other<lb/>
workmen aboard, in the personnel of other vessels lying close by, and<lb/>
some cases in persons ashore in the immediate vicinity of the <hi rend="italic">Anne-<lb/>
Marie</hi>. In all, at least 42 cases and 25 deaths occurred. In one ship,<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi>, which had put to sea, secondary cases occurred. With<lb/>
this exception, all the cases may be accounted for as contracted from the<lb/>
<pb n="26" id="Cb000040"/>
26<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
bites of infected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">Anne-Marie</hi> or nearby, save in the case of<lb/>
Dr. Chaillon, &ldquo;the physician of Montoir,&rdquo; a village some seven kilo-<lb/>
meters distant from St. Nazaire.</p>
<p>From August 5 to August 11 Dr. Chaillon attended, at their homes in<lb/>
the vicinity of Montoir (some miles from St. Nazaire), four stevedores<lb/>
who had been engaged in the unloading of the <hi rend="italic">Anne-Marie</hi> at St.<lb/>
Nazaire and had there been infected. On the 13th of August, seven<lb/>
days after his first, and two days after his last, visit to any of these pa-<lb/>
tients, Dr. Chaillon himself developed yellow fever, of which he died.<lb/>
M&eacute;lier, the reporter of this epidemic, states--as does Madame Chaillon<lb/>
in a letter which he quotes--that Dr. Chaillon had not been to St.<lb/>
Nazaire since the arrival of the <hi rend="italic">Anne-Marie</hi> and that no one in Montoir<lb/>
or its environment had been sick of that disease, before or afterwards,<lb/>
except these stevedores and Dr. Chaillon. No other member of the<lb/>
stevedores' families developed it, nor did any of Dr. Chaillon's household.<lb/>
Absence of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in this section is reported in the summer of 1918<lb/>
(personal communications to the writer).</p>
<p>The data, which are definite and seem to have been most carefully<lb/>
collected, are believed to be reliable; and there is, I think, no question<lb/>
of the nature of the disease in either the stevedores or the physician.<lb/>
Dr. Chaillon could have acquired his sickness from the bite of a mosquito<lb/>
infected aboard the <hi rend="italic">Anne-Marie</hi>, transported from the vessel by one of<lb/>
the stevedores, clinging to his clothing; and, accepting M&eacute;lier's data,<lb/>
the writer can conceive of no other way. The transportation of an<lb/>
insect already infected is predicated because the development of the<lb/>
disease in Dr. Chaillon was too soon after that of his patients for it to<lb/>
have been caused by an insect infected by any of the latter. This case<lb/>
was, indeed, contracted at Montoir, but we feel quite sure that the mos-<lb/>
quito infecting Dr. Chaillon received its infection aboard ship en route<lb/>
to St. Nazaire.</p>
<p>It is fair to say, then, that for the United States, at any rate, <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
have been carried almost everywhere where there was a reasonable<lb/>
chance of their forming a permanent colony, and to a great many places<lb/>
in which no such colony could be formed. For countries in which<lb/>
internal communication is less good than in the United States, this may<lb/>
not be so; but for the United States as a whole, and for the seaports and<lb/>
large river ports everywhere, it is fair to say that <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> have been<lb/>
introduced into all of them, and if they do not exist there now it is<lb/>
because local conditions are unfavorable to their existence.</p>

conditions are favorable, does not lead to a rapid distribution of them<lb/>
therein. They, indeed, increase in number, and may increase rapidly,<lb/>
but the area of infestation is not extended rapidly. We have, natur-<lb/>
ally, only indirect evidence for this, but this indirect evidence is<lb/>
convincing.</p>
<p>In 1876 there were epidemics of yellow fever at Savannah and Bruns-<lb/>
wick, Georgia--at Savannah a severe one. Refugees from these places<lb/>
went to Fernandina, Florida, then a small place. A number of them<lb/>
developed yellow fever there soon after their arrival, but no spread of<lb/>
the disease occurred there, and no one living continuously in Fernandina<lb/>
contracted it. The next year, 1877, a Spanish vessel came into Fernan-<lb/>
dina from Havana, with her captain sick of yellow fever. Some of<lb/>
those going aboard the vessel and working on the wharf contracted<lb/>
yellow fever and developed it at their homes in the little town. At some<lb/>
of these houses foci of yellow fever were established, from which the<lb/>
fever spread, especially in the vicinity of the landing wharf off which the<lb/>
vessel lay, but not confined to it; and before the end of the warm weather<lb/>
there were enough of these foci of infection to make a limited epidemic<lb/>
scattered about the town. Evidently the town was not, in 1876, infested<lb/>
with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> sufficiently to establish foci of infection in the places where<lb/>
yellow fever occurred, while in 1877 it was. The vessel which brought<lb/>
in the sick man, and which was accused of bringing in the &ldquo;bad air from<lb/>
Havana, without which yellow fever could not spread,&rdquo; most probably<lb/>
had <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> aboard, and some may have gone ashore and bred there;<lb/>
but from the history of the spread of the fever, there would seem to<lb/>
have been some places in Fernandina already infested with them in<lb/>
1877--probably seeded the previous fall from Savannah or Brunswick.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMANENT EXISTENCE OF A&Euml;DES AEGYPTI</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Breeding places</hi>. Of the two requirements necessary for the perma-<lb/>
nent existence of the species in any place, the first--suitable breeding<lb/>
places--is largely, or it may be wholly, dependent upon the domestic<lb/>
storage of water. This is a question of the customs of the people and<lb/>
has to be determined for each place by itself. Since the tendency of<lb/>
advancing civilization is to dispense with domestic storage of water,<lb/>
replacing it with a piped supply, this factor in advanced civilization has<lb/>
acted to free a certain number of places from <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> infestation and,<lb/>
even when this was not done completely, to lessen the degree of this<lb/>
infestation, frequently to the point where it was of no sanitary impor-<lb/>
tance. Naturally, the influence of this change is greater in border-line<lb/>
<pb n="28" id="Cb000042"/>
28<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
places, in which the temperature is close to the limit at which the perma-<lb/>
nent existence of the species is possible, so that a slight added handicap<lb/>
would be sufficient to turn the scale against them. As an illustration of<lb/>
the first result (elimination), we find now no <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in Philadelphia or<lb/>
Baltimore, where they undoubtedly existed during some summers before<lb/>
piped water-supply systems were installed, hibernating over some winters<lb/>
in the former city (see p. 42) and doubtless in the latter. An example of<lb/>
reduction, not elimination, is found at Norfolk, Viriginia, where, at<lb/>
present, <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> are very few, although abundant in neighboring villages.<lb/>
The progress of civic improvement tends, then, to remove or lessen<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> infestation in towns, and, by that factor, to render them non-<lb/>
infectible; but it is piped water doing away with its domestic storage,<lb/>
not sewerage, drainage, or general cleanliness, which has this effect.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Temperature</hi>. The other requirement for the existence of the species<lb/>
--suitable limits of temperature--is naturally dependent on the location<lb/>
of the region. It is usually expressed as a function of the latitude: as<lb/>
&ldquo;between 38&deg; north latitude and 35&deg; south latitude.&rdquo; Altitude, how-<lb/>
ever, affects the temperature, especially night temperature, not less than<lb/>
latitude, and to take in this variant--it is by no means the only one--<lb/>
makes an extremely complicated expression.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>
<p>TEMPERATURE LIMITS OF PERMANENT LIFE-ZONES OF A&Euml;DES AEGYPTI</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Biological zones</hi>. Merriam (1894, p. 213) has given us a formula for<lb/>
the temperature limits of the life-zones of both plants and animals,<lb/>
beautiful in its simplicity and comprehensiveness, and very generally<lb/>
applicable: &ldquo;In northward distribution&rdquo; (in the Northern Hemisphere)<lb/>
&ldquo;terrestrial animals and plants are restricted by the sum of the positive<lb/>
temperatures for the entire season of growth and reproduction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It having been determined that the development of the land forms<lb/>
of both plants and animals begins at 6&deg;C., only temperature in excess of<lb/>
6&deg;C. is effective; and the expression &ldquo;positive temperature&rdquo; is used for<lb/>
this excess. The total heat received, then, is measured by the sum of<lb/>
the excesses of each mean daily temperature above 6&deg;C. during the year.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The effect of altitude in limiting the existence of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> is quite certainly due<lb/>
to its effect on temperature. The suggestion, attributed to Finlay (1912, p. 30),<lb/>
(although he never made the categorical assertion) that the insects could not feed<lb/>
or fly at an altitude above 4,000 to 6,000 feet, is disproved by Fernando Lopez<lb/>
(1905), who found they could do both in the City of Mexico at 7,415 feet, an altitude<lb/>
at which, even on the equator, the temperature is below that really suitable for<lb/>
the activity of this insect.</p>
<pb n="29" id="Cb000043"/>
<p>EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
29</p>
<p>The northern limits of Merriam's life-zones would be determined by<lb/>
isotherms showing an annual sum of such normal &ldquo;positive tempera-<lb/>
tures&rdquo; equaling a definite number of degrees--as, for instance, 10,000&deg;C.<lb/>
This number, then, would be the &ldquo;physiological constant&rdquo; of tempera-<lb/>
ture of the organism whose life-zone was bounded by the isotherm in<lb/>
question. Evidently this formula, being dependent on temperature<lb/>
alone, allows for the effect of latitude, altitude, ocean currents, winds,<lb/>
and all other factors that affect temperature.</p>
<p>Howard (1903 and 1905) fixed the limits of life of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in the<lb/>
Northern Hemisphere as the Tropical and Lower Austral Zone as defined<lb/>
by Merriam (see map, p. 30). As he found later, however, that this insect<lb/>
was absent from some regions, as for instance California, which are in-<lb/>
cluded in this zone, this statement is not repeated in his great monograph,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Mosquitoes of North and Central America and the West Indies</hi><lb/>
(Howard, Dyar, and Knab, 1912-1917). Instead we find (p. 292): &ldquo;its<lb/>
permanent distribution is determined by the minimum temperatures<lb/>
and its temporary distribution by the maximum temperatures of any<lb/>
given region wherever it is sufficiently populated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We believe this latter view of Howard's to be absolutely correct and,<lb/>
in spite of the beautiful simplicity of Merriam's formula and its general<lb/>
adaptability to species able to survive (it may be in an inactive stage)<lb/>
very low temperatures, the writer's knowledge of the existence of this<lb/>
insect east of the Rocky Mountains compels him to believe that this<lb/>
formula is not applicable in principle to <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des aegypti</hi>--that its continuous<lb/>
life as a species at any place in that region is dependent on whether the<lb/>
species, hibernating as the egg, is able to survive the <hi rend="italic">low</hi> temperature of<lb/>
the winter, and not on whether there be sufficient heat for development<lb/>
and reproduction during the summer, which is the basis of Merriam's<lb/>
formula. This does not take into consideration the effect of warmed<lb/>
houses in preserving eggs which would otherwise perish; yet this we<lb/>
would have to do, as in practice it habitually occurs. Merriam's<lb/>
formula, as we have said, does not take into consideration the effect<lb/>
of cold in destroying the species at any place, only the absence of the<lb/>
heat necessary for its full evolution; and yet we know that <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> do<lb/>
find heat enough for development and reproduction when introduced by<lb/>
vessels during the summer into places far to the north of their perma-<lb/>
nent life-zone. Nevertheless, on the Atlantic coast and in the central<lb/>
valley of the United States, the northern limit of the Lower Austral<lb/>
Zone is not far from that of the permanent life-zone of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> as fixed by<lb/>
detailed observation, although, we believe, determined by different fac-<lb/>
tors. Hence the publication of the map on page 30.</p>

<p>EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
31</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The two limiting conditions of temperature</hi>. From what has been said<lb/>
of the biology of this insect, there are evidently two conditions of tem-<lb/>
perature, both of which must obtain in any region for the continued<lb/>
existence of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in it:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. The low temperature of winter must not be so low or so prolonged<lb/>
as to destroy the species--the hibernating eggs.</item>
<item>2. The high temperature of summer must be sufficient for the develop-<lb/>
ment and reproduction of the insect.</item></list></p>
<p>The natural life-zone of the species, the region in which it is perma-<lb/>
nent, so far as temperature is concerned, includes all regions in which<lb/>
both of these conditions are fulfilled, and none other.</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF A&Euml;DES AEGYPTI IN AMERICA</p>
<p>East of the Rockies--and the same is true east of the southern part<lb/>
of the Andean Cordilleras--the first condition is the ruling variant.<lb/>
The limits of the life-zone of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> are determined by that combination<lb/>
of latitudes and altitudes which gives temperatures allowing the hiber-<lb/>
nation of the species in the cold season. We think that in no place in<lb/>
these regions where this condition is fulfilled, will the temperature in<lb/>
the hot season fail to be sufficient for the development and reproduction<lb/>
of the insect. On the west coast, however, in both the northern and<lb/>
southern part of it, the second condition will determine the limits of the<lb/>
life-zone of this insect. The winter temperature would not prevent<lb/>
hibernation at any distance north or south of the equator on the coastal<lb/>
plain of the Pacific at which the summer temperature would be suffi-<lb/>
ciently high for development and reproduction. Ocean currents are the<lb/>
main factors controlling temperature in this region.</p>
<p>In the American tropics where, except in one region, the limits of this<lb/>
life-zone are imposed absolutely by altitude, it is the second factor,<lb/>
sufficient summer heat, which is determinative. Seasonal differences<lb/>
of temperature in the tropics are not great, and long before an altitude<lb/>
was reached at which the eggs would perish, heat sufficient for the devel-<lb/>
opment and reproduction of the imago would be lacking. High alti-<lb/>
tudes, too, are especially cold at night, and we have seen that the limit<lb/>
to the functional activity of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> is set by the minimal diurnal (i. e.,<lb/>
nocturnal) temperature rather than the mean diurnal temperature.</p>
<p>The region excepted above is the Pacific coast of South America, from<lb/>
Tumbez south. Here the controlling factor of the temperatures is the<lb/>
Antarctic Current (Humboldt's Current) in conjunction, of course, with<lb/>
the latitude. Here too, there being little seasonal change of tempera-<lb/>
<pb n="32" id="Cb000046"/>
32<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
ture until one goes very far south, the second factor again is the deter-<lb/>
minative one in the limitation of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>.</p>
<p>This condition has its analogy in the life-zones of plants. For instance,<lb/>
the northern limits of coffee, which requires no great heat to mature its<lb/>
seed, but bears very little cold, are determined by the winter tempera-<lb/>
ture. On the other hand, Indian corn, an annual, the seed of which,<lb/>
when mature, is in no wise affected by cold in the winter, can be grown to<lb/>
its maturity only where there is, in summer, a considerable amount of<lb/>
heat, either in degree or duration. <hi rend="italic">Aegypti</hi> is like both; the species--<lb/>
although a hibernating one--is destroyed by a low winter temperature,<lb/>
and cannot develop and reproduce unless with a sufficient summer<lb/>
temperature when it is active. In the latter state it is especially sensi-<lb/>
tive to low night temperature.</p>
<p>At present the neighborhood of Norfolk, Virginia, is about the north-<lb/>
ern limit of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> survival, at sea level, on the Atlantic coast. That<lb/>
they did survive several winters in Philadelphia about the end of the<lb/>
eighteenth century, and probably one winter at least (that of 1797-<lb/>
1798) in New York, has been stated. Cairo, Illinois (also low altitude),<lb/>
or a little north of it, is about their northern limit in the Mississippi<lb/>
Valley. As we go south from these places, the limits of the zone are<lb/>
naturally determined by altitude. This is low (sea-level) at its northern<lb/>
limit and rises as we go south. The foothills of the Appalachians in<lb/>
Georgia and South Carolina are outside of this zone, as are the Ozarks<lb/>
in Arkansas. Finally, in Mexico, <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> have been found at Orizaba<lb/>
(alt. 3684 feet), apparently now in permanence. They have not been<lb/>
found in Jalapa (alt. 4300 feet); and neither San Jos&eacute; (about 4250 feet)<lb/>
nor Cartago (4930 feet), Costa Rica, has proved infectible. The slight<lb/>
but definite spread of yellow fever which has occurred at Alajuela and at<lb/>
Heredia, Costa Rica (alt. about 3000 feet), would show these places to<lb/>
be about on the border line of temperature for the zone. The state-<lb/>
ment, ascribed to Humboldt, of yellow fever's being contracted at Quito,<lb/>
is obviously erroneous. I cannot find that he made it.</p>
<p>On the west coast of South America <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> were found in the coastal<lb/>
region of Peru as far south as the Chilean border (Dunn, 1923) and must<lb/>
have existed further south, for yellow fever has existed (in 1912) in epi-<lb/>
demic form as far south as Tocapilla, Chile, 22&deg; south latitude (U. S. Pub-<lb/>
lic Health Service, 1912, p. 195). From its extent, the infestation of this<lb/>
place with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> must have been general and, since the winters here<lb/>
are not severe, permanent. They were not found, however, anywhere<lb/>
in the foothills of the Cordilleras of northern Peru in 1920 or 1921, due,<lb/>

the writer thought, more to absence of suitable breeding places than to<lb/>
temperature.</p>
<p>On the east coast, the severe epidemics in Buenos Aires in 1870 and<lb/>
1878 and in Montevideo, 1871 and 1878, would show that both towns<lb/>
were well infested with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> at that time; not necessarily, however,<lb/>
that they were within the zone of permanent breeding. Indeed, the<lb/>
late appearance and rarity of such epidemics at these places, and even<lb/>
at Rio Grande do Sul, strongly implies that there was no very early<lb/>
general, permanent infestation with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in this region, as does the<lb/>
fact that the disease was not propagated in the villages near Montevideo<lb/>
when it was introduced. Judging likewise by epidemiological, not by<lb/>
direct entomological, data, Santos (about 24&deg; south latitude) is about<lb/>
the southern limit of the area which has been generally permanently<lb/>
infested with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> on the east coast of America after about the middle<lb/>
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<head>DISPERSION AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF YELLOW FEVER</head>
<pb n="34" id="Cb000048"/>
<p>Of the three factors necessary (pp. 6-8) for the propagation of yellow<lb/>
fever, one, men susceptible to yellow fever, is present and abundant in<lb/>
every community into which the disease is newly introduced. The dis-<lb/>
persion and distribution of yellow fever are dependent, then, on the<lb/>
coincident dispersion or distribution of the causative organism and of<lb/>
active <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>.</p>
<p>The mechanism for the dispersion of the parasite, that is, of infected<lb/>
men and infected mosquitoes, outside of which the parasite has no sus-<lb/>
tained natural existence, is the same as that for the dispersion of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
--i.e., by vessels, railroad coaches, and other means of human transport.<lb/>
This we have discussed, but the details are not all the same and differ<lb/>
among themselves according as the parasite is transported (1) in infected<lb/>
mosquitoes; (2) in infected men; or (3) in a combination of the two.</p>
<p>TRANSPORTATION OF INFECTED MOSQUITOES</p>
<p>This is in all respects like the dispersion of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> as previously given,<lb/>
except that it is concerned with the spread of <hi rend="italic">infected aegypti</hi> only, and<lb/>
that, while the infected insect may breed aboard vessels, as we have<lb/>
stated, her progeny as such are not infected.</p>
<p>Infective <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> may infect the men aboard a vessel or coach; or,<lb/>
the men being immune to yellow fever, or the insects not yet in the<lb/>
infective stage, or there being from any cause no contact en route be-<lb/>
tween susceptible men and infective insects, the latter may be trans-<lb/>
ported to the place of destination without the occurrence of human infec-<lb/>
tion en route. At these places the result, immediate and permanent,<lb/>
will be determined by the conditions of temperature, breeding places,<lb/>
and susceptible population there existing, as detailed before.</p>
<p>If the infected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> remain aboard ship, they may infect men aboard<lb/>
or coming aboard, and independently of temperature conditions outside,<lb/>
as has happened at Halifax, 1842 and 1861, Portland, Maine, 1801, etc.<lb/>
If the outside temperature at the port of arrival is high enough for feed-<lb/>
ing, the infective insects may leave the vessel and infect men within their<lb/>
range of flight, or in places to which they may be carried, as long as they<lb/>
34<lb/>
<pb n="35" id="Cb000049"/>
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
35<lb/>
remain active, as happened at St. Nazaire, 1861, Swansea, 1865, etc.<lb/>
If the conditions are suitable for breeding, they may establish a colony,<lb/>
temporary or permanent, according to temperature conditions already<lb/>
discussed. If their progeny should be infected from the men infected<lb/>
by the first (imported) generation of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, secondary cases may occur,<lb/>
and there may even be an epidemic at once, as in 1861 in the ship <hi rend="italic">Are-<lb/>
quipa</hi>, sailing south with infected mosquitoes taken aboard from the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Anne-Marie</hi> at St. Nazaire (M&eacute;lier, 1863). Should the place be already<lb/>
infested with active <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> (infectible territory: see page 40) the<lb/>
chance of the propagation of yellow fever therein is enormously increased<lb/>
and an endemic focus may or may not be formed, depending upon the<lb/>
range of temperature and other conditions at the place.</p>
<p>Experience has shown it to be the rule, however, for infected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
to disappear from vessels during a voyage of moderate length in cold<lb/>
climates. With steamships, indeed, this is the rule even in warm cli-<lb/>
mates. None breed aboard steamships; those taken aboard at the port<lb/>
of departure die or are blown outboard--the latter usually--if the voy-<lb/>
age is a fairly long one. Aboard sailing vessels the contrary is the case.<lb/>
Many a sailing vessel used to show fever on the way up from Santos or<lb/>
Rio and then infect men going aboard her at a Gulf port of the United<lb/>
States, forty to sixty-five days out (see page 37). Sometimes, how-<lb/>
ever, infected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> disappeared from sailing vessels even in the<lb/>
tropics. For example, according to notes taken at Ship Island Quaran-<lb/>
tine, in 1890 the &ldquo;British ship <hi rend="italic">Prince Edward</hi>, Rio for Ship Island,<lb/>
Mississippi, had yellow fever developing aboard for over twenty-one<lb/>
days from Rio, losing four men. Put into Barbados on the thirty-sixth<lb/>
day. In quarantine there without disinfection. Shipped eight men to<lb/>
replace those lost in Rio and en route. Arrived Ship Island Quarantine<lb/>
twenty-four days later. No more sickness en route, on arrival, or in<lb/>
Quarantine.&rdquo; The men shipped in Barbados were all apprentices,<lb/>
bright-faced English boys, just out from home, and, unquestionably,<lb/>
susceptible to yellow fever. Evidently the vessel had had infected<lb/>
mosquitoes aboard, as cases developed too long after leaving Rio to have<lb/>
been contracted there; but, as evidently, she had cleared herself of them<lb/>
before she shipped these boys.</p>
<p>These cases, however, are not the rule. Usually <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> breed aboard<lb/>
a sailing vessel as long as the temperature permits, the newly developed<lb/>
mosquitoes are infected by the first lot of cases, and the duration of the<lb/>
infection of the vessel is limited only by the supply of susceptible men.<lb/>
In warm climates, then, the vessel may be, and frequently is, infected,<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
that is, has infected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> aboard, weeks after yellow fever in men<lb/>
disappears--all being immunized or dead.</p>
<p>TRANSPORTATION OF INFECTED MEN</p>
<p>If there are uninfected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> aboard the carrier and the men are<lb/>
infective to mosquitoes, these may be infected by the men. Such<lb/>
mosquitoes, after their period of extrinsic incubation is passed and they<lb/>
have become infective, may infect other men aboard the carrier or else-<lb/>
where. The end result depends upon the conditions of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> activity<lb/>
and the accessibility to infective <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> of susceptible men when and<lb/>
where these secondary cases occur. If this be ashore, in port, we may<lb/>
limit our consideration to the question of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> activity, as our port of<lb/>
destination is supposed to be free from yellow fever, hence with an<lb/>
abundance of susceptible men.</p>
<p>If there be no <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> aboard, or if the infected men aboard the carrier<lb/>
are only in the incubative state<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> while en route, there will be no infection<lb/>
of mosquitoes aboard ship.</p>
<p>In the first case the end result will depend (a) on whether the sick men<lb/>
are infective to mosquitoes when they leave the carrier and (b) on the<lb/>
nature of the <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> activity at the place to which they are transported.<lb/>
In the second, the infected men being still in the incubative stage when<lb/>
leaving the carrier, the end result will again depend on the <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> activ-<lb/>
ity at the place in which they develop yellow fever, on whether the place<lb/>
be infectible or non-infectible territory (see page 40), and whether or<lb/>
not conditions of temperature allow of the formation of an endemic focus.</p>
<p>COMBINED METHOD OF DISPERSION</p>
<p>Ordinarily the dispersion of yellow fever on land has been by the<lb/>
movement of infected men. The infected mosquito, although a factor,<lb/>
is of very much less importance. By sea, however, the method usually<lb/>
has been a combination of the two. Infected mosquitoes came aboard<lb/>
and infected the personnel, or infected men came aboard and infected<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> already there. In the first case the uninfected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
aboard quickly became themselves infected from the infected personnel;<lb/>
in the second, the susceptible men aboard became infected--as secondary<lb/>
cases--as soon as the period of extrinsic incubation of the thus infected<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> had passed. With <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> breeding aboard a vessel, the fever</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> If past the stage infective to mosquitoes, the man is considered to be no longer<lb/>
&ldquo;infected,&rdquo; although he may be still sick with yellow fever.</p>
<pb n="37" id="Cb000051"/>
<p>EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
37</p>
<p>terminated when the human material was exhausted, the vessel remain-<lb/>
ing infected for weeks afterward. With a vessel not breeding <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
aboard, the fever usually terminated by the insects with which she<lb/>
started being blown outboard--rarely lasting long enough for them to<lb/>
die. When the vessel reached port, if she had freed herself from<lb/>
infection, of course she carried no parasites. If she was still infected--<lb/>
parasites in men or in mosquitoes or in both--the end result depended<lb/>
on the breeding conditions ashore and, if these were suitable, on whether<lb/>
the range of temperature allowed of the formation of an endemic focus<lb/>
or not. These have been sufficiently discussed.</p>
<p>TIME ELEMENT IN CONVEYANCE BY VESSEL</p>
<p>Provided a vessel be free from <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> there is no danger of the intro-<lb/>
duction of yellow fever by infected men from a port over twelve days<lb/>
distant. This interval should cover the maximum period of incubation<lb/>
plus the period of infectivity to mosquitoes. To guard against infected<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, however, a much longer time is required if time be depended on.<lb/>
For example, in 1890 the &ldquo;British bark, <hi rend="italic">Curlew</hi>, arrived at Ship Island<lb/>
Quarantine, direct from Rio, 58 days out, no history of yellow fever in<lb/>
Rio or of sickness of any kind en route. Four days after opening the<lb/>
hatches one man sickened with yellow fever&rdquo; (author's notes taken<lb/>
at Ship Island Quarantine Station). To say positively that no cases of<lb/>
yellow fever had occurred en route and been overlooked is, of course,<lb/>
impossible; but no absence from duty en route on account of sickness<lb/>
was logged, nor was any discoverable on questioning officers and crew.</p>
<p>Such cases must be extremely rare now, and were never common, yet<lb/>
the same thing happened that same summer to three other vessels at the<lb/>
Ship Island Quarantine: British bark <hi rend="italic">Avon</hi> (Rio), 38 days to first case;<lb/>
British bark <hi rend="italic">Chippewa</hi> (Rio), 68 days; Spanish bark <hi rend="italic">Castilla</hi> (Havana),<lb/>
12 days. Aboard the <hi rend="italic">Avon</hi> two cases, men who cleaned out a store-<lb/>
room. Aboard the <hi rend="italic">Castilla</hi>, two cases, captain and mate, all others<lb/>
aboard her being immune to yellow fever. Three deaths among the six<hi rend="superscript">2</hi><lb/>
--all autopsied. The next summer Dr. G., Assistant Quarantine<lb/>
Officer at this station, died of yellow fever contracted in quarantine,<lb/>
although no vessel up to that time had showed yellow fever for over three<lb/>
weeks before arrival, and the one from which we believed it was con-<lb/>
tracted had been over thirty days without a reported case. Most, or all,<lb/>
of her crew were immune--many immunized on the way up from Rio.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Statement implies two cases aboard the <hi rend="italic">Chippewa</hi>.--Ed.</p>

<p>38<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>It is for this reason that it has been feared that on the change of trade-<lb/>
routes consequent on the opening of the Panama Canal, yellow fever might<lb/>
be carried across the Pacific to Asia by infected mosquitoes shut up in the<lb/>
holds of steamers (producing no sickness among their personnel to serve<lb/>
as a warning), while there was no apprehension of danger directly from<lb/>
infected men. Men would develop the fever and be past the infective<lb/>
stage before the vessel reached an Asian port; and, unless they infected<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> aboard, would not be a source of danger, in spite of all Southern<lb/>
Asia's being &ldquo;infectible territory&rdquo; (Carter, 1924-b).</p>
<p>RATE OF SPREAD ON INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>If yellow fever (the causative organism) be introduced into a suscepti-<lb/>
ble community in which active <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> are abundant and generally<lb/>
distributed, it will spread, at first slowly, on account of the period of<lb/>
extrinsic incubation in the mosquito; hence, the long interval between<lb/>
infecting and secondary cases. Soon, however, cases of yellow fever<lb/>
contracted in the first focus will develop in other places and form other<lb/>
centers of infected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, and thereafter, say after six to eight or ten<lb/>
weeks, the spread will be rapid. On the other hand, if yellow fever be<lb/>
introduced with the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> introduction of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, secondary foci outside<lb/>
of the area of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> infestation cannot be formed; this area can spread<lb/>
no faster than the <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> do; and thus spread is slow.</p>
<p>An illustration of this slow spread is found in the epidemic in Boston<lb/>
in 1798 (Rand, 1800). The infection began at a dock; and cases con-<lb/>
tracted here developed in many parts of town, but in no case formed a<lb/>
focus from which other men were infected. The infected district, that<lb/>
is, the district in which yellow fever could be contracted, advanced from<lb/>
Stoddard's Wharf, where it began in June, some squares from the water,<lb/>
and to other wharves as well. &ldquo;The contagious effluvia were conveyed&rdquo;<lb/>
--down the wind--&ldquo;into Battery-march, Liberty-square and Kilby-<lb/>
street.&rdquo; Quite certainly, in this case, <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> were introduced the same<lb/>
year as the fever. The eggs would be little apt to have survived a Bos<lb/>
ton winter.</p>
<p>Obviously, the rate of spread, whether slow or comparatively rapid,<lb/>
may give us a means of determining the degree of infestation of a place<lb/>
with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, and whether they were introduced with--or about the<lb/>
same time as--the fever, or long before.</p>

<p>REINFECTION OF INFECTING PLACES</p>
<p>Communities in which yellow fever was introduced and established<lb/>
itself, themselves became centers from which it might and not infre-<lb/>
quently did spread, directly or indirectly, reinfecting the places from which<lb/>
the infection had originally been received, when such places had freed<lb/>
themselves from infection by failure of the human host or had been freed<lb/>
by a seasonal fall of temperature. Africa quite surely infected the island<lb/>
of Grenada directly, and a number of the Lesser Antilles indirectly, with<lb/>
the celebrated &ldquo;Fever of Bulam,&rdquo; although Africa is credited with hav-<lb/>
ing suffered infection from the Caribbean more than once. So Vera<lb/>
Cruz--quite certainly the source of the Havana fever of 1761--ascribes<lb/>
many of her epidemics to importations from Havana. Yellow fever<lb/>
seems to have been sent back and forth, like a shuttlecock, between<lb/>
Pernambuco and the Slave Coast in Africa. The recriminations be-<lb/>
tween the different islands of the Lesser Antilles, and between them<lb/>
and the Guianas, regarded as so humorous by Moreau de Jonn&egrave;s (1820)<lb/>
and Cornilliac (1886), were reasonable and just.</p>

<head>THE RELATIONS OF TEMPERATURE AND SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS TO<lb/>
THE OCCURRENCE AND PERSISTENCE OF YELLOW FEVER</head>
<pb n="40" id="Cb000054"/>
<p>Very obviously, in regions in which the temperature at all seasons is<lb/>
within the limits given for functional activity, given suitable breeding<lb/>
places--and in practice only the lower limit need be considered<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>--the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> imago will be active (reproducing and feeding) the whole year<lb/>
around. In such regions the second requirement for the continuous<lb/>
existence of yellow fever<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>--the presence of functionally active <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
imagoes--will exist at all seasons of the year; and if the other two factors<lb/>
are also present, yellow fever may continue during the entire year.<lb/>
Such a fever is said to be endemic, and such regions are said to be in the<lb/>
endemic zone.</p>
<p>This second factor (active <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>) will also be present at any season<lb/>
(the breeding places being unchanged) in proportion as temperature at<lb/>
that season approaches the optimum of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> development; and conse-<lb/>
quently--the other two factors remaining constant--yellow fever will<lb/>
increase and decrease as the temperature approaches and departs from<lb/>
this optimum. This was seen in Havana, Rio, Vera Cruz, and other<lb/>
places in which the fall of temperature was not sufficient entirely to<lb/>
prevent <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> activity at any time, but did limit it during the colder<lb/>
season.</p>
<p>INFECTIBLE AND NON-INFECTIBLE TERRITORY: DETERMINING CONDITIONS<lb/>
OF TEMPERATURE</p>
<p>The conditions of temperature affect the factor of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> activity in<lb/>
other ways, in none of which is it compatible with the endemicity of yel-</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Whether the species can survive the intense heat occurring, for example, in<lb/>
Mesopotamia and on the shores of the Red Sea, I do not know. For the first,<lb/>
Christophers and Shortt (1921) give the mean maximum temperature for July as<lb/>
109.4&deg;F., and for August 110&deg;F. Possibly the insects may be able to find cool<lb/>
places about porous (&ldquo;sweating&rdquo;) water jars. The hot season is very dry, and<lb/>
evaporation might keep them cool, but there would unquestionably be a heavy<lb/>
mortality among them. The temperatures quoted are well above death points<lb/>
found experimentally, even with abundant moisture, the lack of which lowers it.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The three factors referred to (see pp. 6-8) are: (1) the causative organism of<lb/>
the disease; (2) active <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des aegypti</hi> mosquitoes; and (3) susceptible men--the<lb/>
mosquitoes having access to both the other two.--Ed.</p>
<p>40</p>
<pb n="41" id="Cb000055"/>
<p>EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
41</p>
<p>low fever, that is, continuance of the infection from year to year with-<lb/>
out reintroduction, and yet with any of which yellow fever may and<lb/>
does occur.</p>
<p>(1) <hi rend="italic">The seasonal fall of temperature may be sufficient to suspend the<lb/>
activity of the imagoes for some considerable time--generally by destroying<lb/>
them--but is not sufficient to destroy the eggs</hi>.</p>
<p>In this case yellow fever will disappear absolutely if all imagoes are<lb/>
destroyed and none others develop for about twelve or fourteen days.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi><lb/>
With the return of warmer weather the eggs will develop and <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
reappear. At first they will be in numbers inversely proportional to<lb/>
the length and severity of the winter. This is true even in New Orleans<lb/>
and Mobile; the early <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> do not appear in those places in swarms, as<lb/>
do <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des sollicitans</hi>, for example. Apparently a large proportion of the<lb/>
fall-laid eggs fail of development. This is probably less apparent as one<lb/>
goes south. Later in the summer <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> increase until they are in<lb/>
sufficient numbers for the propagation of yellow fever; but the parasite<lb/>
having disappeared in the meantime from the men who had been infected,<lb/>
the mosquitoes cannot be infected, and yellow fever will not appear in<lb/>
such places unless the parasite--in infected men or infected insects--<lb/>
be reintroduced.</p>
<p>Such places were Memphis, Tennessee; Jackson, Mississippi; etc.<lb/>
Every summer, during the activity of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, these places were &ldquo;infect-<lb/>
ible territory,&rdquo; and if men infected with yellow fever were introduced,<lb/>
the disease might propagate, to die out entirely the next cold season.<lb/>
There are, however, &ldquo;border-line places,&rdquo; in which the temperature in<lb/>
some winters is low enough to eliminate yellow fever (by destruction of<lb/>
infected imagoes) and in others is not low enough. In the mild winters<lb/>
yellow fever infection will not die out in these places, and we have a<lb/>
&ldquo;hold-over&rdquo; epidemic when the number of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> sufficiently increases<lb/>
the next summer to make one. This probably has occurred sometimes<lb/>
at New Orleans, as from 1897 to 1898. The writer is quite sure it has<lb/>
not been usual. He knows no reason to believe that it has ever occurred<lb/>
at Mobile.</p>
<p>(2) <hi rend="italic">The temperature during the cold season may fall so low and remain<lb/>
low) so long as to destroy the viability of the eggs of the aegypti</hi>.</p>
<p>Under such conditions there is no hibernation of this species. It is</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> There was a considerable fall of temperature in Memphis during the epidemic<lb/>
of 1897, soon after it began in the fall. This was followed by a marked drop in<lb/>
reported cases, but with the onset of warmer weather there was an increase of the<lb/>
fever, which kept on about as usual.</p>
<pb n="42" id="Cb000056"/>
<p>42<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>destroyed during the winter and, unless it is reintroduced after the<lb/>
weather becomes warm, such places remain uninfectible even if men<lb/>
infected with yellow fever be introduced. If <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> be introduced, by<lb/>
vessels from southern countries usually, and the conditions for their<lb/>
breeding--temperature and artificial containers near residences--be<lb/>
then suitable, they may propagate to such an extent as to render the place<lb/>
infectible on the introduction of men with yellow fever later in the sum-<lb/>
mer, the fever, of course, disappearing with cold weather, and the locality<lb/>
again becoming &ldquo;non-infectible&rdquo; until <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> are again introduced and<lb/>
propagate.</p>
<p>It would rarely happen, however, during the short summer of a town<lb/>
in which the winter was cold enough to forbid hibernation of the species,<lb/>
that <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> introduced that season would be able to spread generally<lb/>
over the town to a distance from the wharves, unless, indeed, they were<lb/>
introduced in a number of places, scattered over the town. It is on this<lb/>
account that it seems unreasonable to believe that the generalized epi-<lb/>
demics of 1798 in New York and of 1793, 1797, 1798, and 1799 in Phila-<lb/>
delphia could have been conveyed by the progeny of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> introduced<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">during</hi> the years in question--even if they were introduced in a consid-<lb/>
erable number of places on the water-front. For such generalized epi-<lb/>
demics (there were 2,086 deaths reported in New York in 1798; 4,044 in<lb/>
Philadelphia in 1793; and 5,823 in the other three years) <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> must<lb/>
have been fairly well scattered over the town at the commencement of<lb/>
hot weather. That is, they must have hibernated as eggs from the<lb/>
previous fall. The epidemic of 1820 in Philadelphia, on the contrary,<lb/>
was confined absolutely to a small part of the water-front. Cases--and<lb/>
many of them--contracted in the infected district and developing in<lb/>
many other parts of the town, in no instance led to secondary cases--to<lb/>
the great satisfaction of the non-contagionists. Evidently, in 1793<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> were all over Philadelphia, and in 1820 were confined to a small<lb/>
water-front district. This last epidemic may, then, have been caused<lb/>
by insects, and the progeny of insects, introduced by ships earlier in<lb/>
that season. The first cases were reported July 24.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that water in pipes was introduced on the water-front<lb/>
in 1821 and 1822 (personal letter of C. E. Davis, Chief of Water Bureau,<lb/>
Philadelphia, April 4, 1922) which doubtless did away with fire barrels<lb/>
and other containers on the wharves which had furnished breeding<lb/>
places for <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> going ashore from vessels lying alongside. Since that<lb/>
date only one outbreak of yellow fever, that of 1853, limited to a few<lb/>
squares on the water-front, has occurred in Philadelphia.</p>
<pb n="43" id="Cb000057"/>
<p>EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
43</p>
<p>Naturally, if the mosquitoes introduced be already infected, they<lb/>
may furnish not only the parasites necessary to infect, but the parentage<lb/>
of the insects necessary for subsequent conveyance. They could, how-<lb/>
ever, for the reasons given, rarely produce more than a very localized<lb/>
epidemic, disappearing with cold weather.</p>
<p>(3) <hi rend="italic">The conditions of temperature may be such that when aegypti are<lb/>
introduced they cannot propagate</hi>.</p>
<p>The mosquitoes introduced, however, may be able to feed to a small<lb/>
extent, and, if infected, to infect a few men.</p>
<p>Infection of men by <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, already infected, leaving a vessel, would<lb/>
explain the infection reported at Quebec, in 1864, of a man on the dock<lb/>
at which a vessel from the West Indies lay; at St. Nazaire, in 1861 (the<lb/>
famous epidemic of the <hi rend="italic">Anne-Marie</hi> so beautifully reported by M&eacute;lier<lb/>
1863), in which fifteen cases are reported in men who had not been<lb/>
aboard the infected vessel; at Swansea in 1865 (the report of which by<lb/>
Buchanan, 1866, rivals that of M&eacute;lier) to which twenty-two cases and<lb/>
fifteen deaths are positively, and twenty-nine cases and sixteen deaths<lb/>
are probably, ascribed. In none of these outbreaks did secondary cases<lb/>
occur.</p>
<p>If propagation be prevented by absence of suitable breeding places,<lb/>
there will be no infestation of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, although those introduced will<lb/>
feed as long as they remain active and, if infective, may give rise to<lb/>
cases of yellow fever. From these, however, we would not have second-<lb/>
ary cases, except in very rare instances from the infection of uninfected<lb/>
insects introduced at the same time. A number of the &ldquo;sporadic cases&rdquo;<lb/>
reported in Philadelphia along the water-front after 1822 were probably<lb/>
from this cause. The writer was able, in August, 1903, to raise <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
from cans exposed on the fruit wharves in Baltimore and from no other<lb/>
places in town. Had there been suitable breeding places in sufficient<lb/>
numbers there probably would have been a local infestation of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>.<lb/>
That it was not a question of temperature was shown by their breeding<lb/>
where artificial containers were provided.</p>
<p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Aegypti may be active aboard ship in the harbors of ports, the tem-<lb/>
peratures of which ashore are well outside of the feeding limits of that insect</hi>.</p>
<p>This is in no wise uncommon. They remain active aboard in the<lb/>
warm or heated compartments of the vessel and, if infected, may com-<lb/>
municate yellow fever to the seamen aboard or to men coming aboard,<lb/>
who may develop it ashore. This has occurred at Brest and Rochefort,<lb/>
in France; at Portland, Maine; at Halifax and Boston, more than once;<lb/>
and at St. Pierre de Miqu&eacute;lon. It is not, properly speaking, an introduc-<lb/>

tion of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> into a place and is, naturally, of no epidemiological, and of<lb/>
little sanitary, importance.</p>
<p>Naturally, places under the temperature conditions of (3) or (4) are<lb/>
always &ldquo;non-infectible territory.&rdquo; Those under (2) are uninfectible<lb/>
also until <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> are introduced and have become sufficiently abundant<lb/>
to propagate yellow fever, as are those under (1) during the winter.</p>
<p>The terms were coined before the r&ocirc;le of the <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> was known, to<lb/>
indicate the well-known fact that yellow fever would spread in certain<lb/>
places if men with yellow fever were introduced, while in others it would<lb/>
not.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi></p>
<p>ZONES OF OCCURRENCE OF YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>The regions in which yellow fever occurs may be divided into:</p>
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">Epidemic areas</hi>. In these the duration of yellow fever is limited by<lb/>
the season--as at Memphis, Tennessee; Montgomery, Alabama; etc.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Aegypti</hi> are present and active during only a part of the year; not active<lb/>
during the cold season--existing then, if at all, only in the egg stage.</p>
<p>Epidemic areas are naturally divided into two classes: (a) those in<lb/>
which <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> exist permanently--the eggs surviving the winters--and<lb/>
(b) those in which the species does not so survive.</p>
<p>In the first, the places are always &ldquo;infectible territory&rdquo; in the summer<lb/>
--as Mobile and Memphis. In the second, they are infectible only<lb/>
when a new supply of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> is introduced--as were Boston and New-<lb/>
buryport, Massachusetts, etc. There are, naturally, a certain number<lb/>
of border-line places in which the eggs survive some winters, but not all.<lb/>
These places are infectible in some summers without a new introduction<lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>; and in others such an introduction, generally by vessel, is<lb/>
required for them to become infectible. Such places in the past were<lb/>
Philadelphia, Baltimore, and (rarely indeed) New York.</p>
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">Endemic areas</hi>. In these the duration of yellow fever is not limited<lb/>
by the season. <hi rend="italic">Aegypti</hi> are present in sufficient numbers and function-<lb/>
ally active throughout the entire year, and once the fever is established,<lb/>
its duration, in the absence of control, is dependent on the supply of<lb/>
susceptible men. It may last for several years, as at Tampico, Car-<lb/>
tagena, Maracaibo, etc., eventually dying out, not for lack of active</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> The writer, in the summer of 1899, suggested to Dr. Finlay the examination of<lb/>
both kinds of places for his <hi rend="italic">Culex icteroides</hi> (<hi rend="italic">A&euml;des</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi>) <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>) as a test,<lb/>
partial, of course, of his (Finlay's) doctrine. This was begun at Las Animas, but<lb/>
was interrupted by the writer's leaving Cuba to work in the Key West epidemic<lb/>
of that year.</p>
<pb n="45" id="Cb000059"/>
<p>EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YELLOW FEVER<lb/>

<p>insect vectors, but from failure of the human host. Such regions may be<lb/>
called <hi rend="italic">temporary endemic</hi> areas. If the conditions of population are such<lb/>
as to maintain a sufficient supply of susceptible men, we have a <hi rend="italic">perma-<lb/>
nent endemic</hi> area, where the disease not only lasts through the whole<lb/>
year but does not tend to die out spontaneously. A permanent endemic<lb/>
area may be a true <hi rend="italic">permanent endemic center</hi>, comprising a single large<lb/>
city. Such were Havana, Rio, and Guayaquil. Or it may be a <hi rend="italic">regional<lb/>
focus</hi>, such as that of Yucatan and Campeche.</p>
<p>The difference between epidemic and endemic areas, as we have de-<lb/>
fined them, depends on the biology of <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des aegypti</hi>; that between tem-<lb/>
porarily endemic and permanently endemic areas is sociological, and<lb/>
depends on the supply of susceptible men.</p>
<p>The difference in epidemiology which yellow fever presented in differ-<lb/>
ent places naturally led, years ago, to the classification of such regions<lb/>
into different zones for its occurrence. These have been formulated by<lb/>
a number of men: James Jones (1858), B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud (1890), Guit-<lb/>
eras (1888), and others eminent in the study of this disease. That<lb/>
formulated above, while different from any of the classical divisions is,<lb/>
the writer believes, correct, and as comprehensive and definite as is<lb/>
consistent with reasonable brevity.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;endemic,&rdquo; applied to a disease, as used in medical litera-<lb/>
ture, carries the meaning of permanence in a community or region, al-<lb/>
though there is no etymological reason therefor. Liebermeister's differ-<lb/>
ential definition (quoted by Chaill&eacute;, 1882, p. 91) is: &ldquo;An endemic is<lb/>
limited locally and remains long or persistently, while an epidemic<lb/>
appears at intervals and again disappears.&rdquo; The definition of an endemic<lb/>
disease quoted from an unnamed French writer by the British West<lb/>
African Yellow Fever Commission (Yellow Fever Commission (West<lb/>
Africa), 1916, p. 250): &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Une maladie habituelle du pays</hi>,&rdquo; is, one thinks,<lb/>
as definitive as the German's and shorter.</p>
<p>Hitherto, yellow fever has always been regarded as &ldquo;endemic&rdquo; in both<lb/>
classes of places--those where it persisted indefinitely and those where it<lb/>
died out after a period of several years. Neither of the qualifying terms<lb/>
&ldquo;temporary&rdquo; or &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; is altogether consistent with the current<lb/>
use of the word &ldquo;endemic.&rdquo; Nevertheless, the difference between (1)<lb/>
places in which yellow fever will last two or three or even more years and<lb/>
yet die out from lack of susceptible men, and (2) those places in which,<lb/>
enough of such men being present, it lasts indefinitely, is a real and<lb/>
important difference, and should be provided for in place designations.</p>

<head>DISEASES WHICH HAVE, OR MIGHT HAVE, BEEN CON-<lb/>
FUSED WITH YELLOW FEVER IN THE PAST</head>
<pb n="49" id="Cb000063"/>
<p>In looking over past history one finds accounts of the existence of<lb/> 
diseases and of epidemics. Not a few of these--since 1492 especially,<lb/> 
and some before--have been considered by medical historians to have<lb/> 
been yellow fever. The earlier accounts, up to near the end of the<lb/> 
seventeenth century, are none of them by physicians,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> and even when a<lb/> 
description is given one is rarely able by it to recognize the malady with<lb/> 
any certainty. Quite frequently, the description evidently covers<lb/> 
several diseases considered by the chronicler as different manifestations<lb/> 
of one, with, at times, additions as evidently imaginary. The taste<lb/> 
for the grotesque and the horrible seems ingrained in men of a certain<lb/> 
stage of culture. More often, no description is attempted; the prevailing<lb/> 
epidemic is simply classed as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">una peste</hi>;&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">una fiebre pestilencial</hi>&rdquo; etc.<lb/> 
These are the most common terms used, although &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la modorra</hi>,&rdquo; (the<lb/> 
lethargy, the stupor, the sleepiness), meaning, I presume, an ultimate<lb/> 
comatose state, or it may be simply weakness, was common in early<lb/> 
Spanish writing, and evidently covered more than one disease. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">El<lb/> 
cont&aacute;gio</hi>&rdquo; is also used, implying the opinion that the disease in question<lb/> 
was communicable, and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la epid&eacute;mia</hi>,&rdquo; implying its high prevalence.</p>
<p>Now doubtless some of these epidemics were yellow fever and, as<lb/> 
undoubtedly, some of them were not; and to judge between them with<lb/> 
even an approach to accuracy, it seems advisable to consider what epi-<lb/>
demics besides yellow fever one might expect to find in the countries and<lb/> 
at the times covered by these accounts, and also what would be the<lb/> 
points of difference between them, either in occurrence, or in such<lb/> 
symptomatology as would be apt to be noted by the chroniclers of that<lb/> 
day, premising that the symptoms must be quite obvious to be so noted.</p>
<p><hi rend="supersceript">1</hi> Dr. Chanca, the physician to the second voyage of Columbus, indeed mentions<lb/> 
in his letter (Monte y Tejada, 1853, p. 298) relating to the voyage, &ldquo;one-third of our<lb/> 
people have fallen sick within four or five days&rdquo; (the implication is after landing),<lb/> 
but beyond ascribing it to &ldquo;the toil and privation of the journey,&rdquo; and the pious<lb/> 
&ldquo;trust in our Lord to be able to restore all the sick to health,&rdquo; he gives no account<lb/> 
of the disease. Besides this, the first account by any physician of any epidemic in<lb/> 
the New World that I am able to find is that of the &ldquo;Fever of Olinda&rdquo; (Pernam-<lb/> 
buco), in 1685 and 1686, by Dr. Jo&atilde;o Ferreira da Rosa (1694), 200 years later.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>Before going into the differentiation of yellow fever from the diseases<lb/> 
with which it might have been confused, it may be well to give a very<lb/> 
brief r&eacute;sum&eacute; of such characteristics of yellow fever itself as are likely to<lb/> 
be noted by our old chroniclers or which may be inferred from the con-<lb/>
text of their accounts and which are significant for distinguishing other<lb/> 
diseases.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) It occurs (in epidemics) only in hot, or fairly hot, weather.</item>
<item>(2) It is apt to occur in epidemics: certain to do so in a crowd of<lb/> 
white (susceptible) newcomers.</item>
<item>(3) It is a disease of collections of men--civic rather than rural.</item>
<item>(4) It not only develops, but is contracted and propagated, aboard<lb/> 
ships on the high seas, and under some conditions is communicable from<lb/> 
ships to places ashore and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>.</item>
<item>(5) It is a disease of high, or fairly high, case-mortality among all<lb/> 
races except negroes, and especially among robust adults. Among<lb/> 
negroes the death rate is quite low absolutely; very low comparatively.</item>
<item>(6) The deaths are usually from the fifth to the eighth day, grouped<lb/> 
on the sixth and seventh.</item>
<item>(7) Convalescence, once established, is <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> and rapid. Anemia<lb/> 
is not produced by yellow fever, or is found only, to quote Pym (1815),<lb/> 
in the fortunate &ldquo;few who survive venesection.&rdquo;</item>
<item>(8) The characteristic <hi rend="italic">symptoms</hi> which would be noticed are: sudden<lb/> 
attack; severe pains in head, back, and limbs; <hi rend="italic">extreme</hi> prostration;<lb/> 
jaundice; hemorrhage--especially showing at, not necessarily from, the<lb/> 
mouth and nose; and black vomit.</item>
</list></p>
<p>Of these symptoms, sudden attack and the pains mentioned are too<lb/> 
common to other diseases to be distinctive.</p>
<p>Jaundice, too, is, of course, a symptom common to many diseases<lb/> 
of hot climates, although it is not confined to those of such climates.<lb/> 
Of yellow fever, &ldquo;the dead are always yellow,&rdquo; says Dutroulau (1868,<lb/> 
p. 409).</p>
<p>Hemorrhages, not unlike those in yellow fever, occur in certain<lb/> 
epidemics of typhus and spirochetoses.</p>
<p>Black vomit, which is merely blood altered by the acid contents of the<lb/> 
stomach, may, of course, occur among the hemorrhagic manifestations<lb/> 
of the spirochetoses, although in fact the gastric hemorrhage, when it<lb/> 
occurs in them, has usually been so profuse, or the gastric acid in so small<lb/> 
an amount, that it has usually been reported by the older writers not as<lb/>
<pb n="51" id="Cb000065"/>
DISEASES CONFUSED WITH YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
51<lb/>
black vomit, but as blood. In the cases of Graves and Stokes (1827)--<lb/> 
trained clinicians--true black vomit was reported, and so in those of<lb/> 
Noc and Nogue (1921). In no other epidemic disease except yellow<lb/> 
fever and certain spirochetoses does this symptom occur at all frequently.<lb/> 
If the spirochetosis be louse-borne (like typhus) it will not continue<lb/> 
in a hot climate.</p>
<p>Black vomit, the lesser degrees of it at any rate, is also occasionally<lb/> 
produced by prolonged straining vomiting, as in sea-sickness, after<lb/> 
ether, etc.; and full black vomit occurs in some cases of intestinal ob-<lb/>
struction and peritonitis, and from the ingestion of irritant poisons,<lb/> 
alcoholism, etc. The occurrence of isolated cases of black vomit, then,<lb/> 
is not sufficient evidence of yellow fever.</p>
<p>On the negative side, that is, the non-report of this symptom, one<lb/> 
must note that not a few of the earlier writers who lay stress on hemor-<lb/>
rhage from the mouth in yellow fever do not mention black vomit.<lb/> 
They either fail to notice it, or fail to distinguish it from the very dark<lb/> 
green (&ldquo;bilious&rdquo;) vomit so common in malarial fevers. Towne (1726), a<lb/> 
physician, who wrote an otherwise extremely good description of yellow<lb/> 
fever in Barbados, states that the vomit &ldquo;is of the bilious kind.&rdquo; P&egrave;re<lb/> 
du Tertre (1667, vol. i, p. 423) mentions &ldquo;continual vomiting,&rdquo; but<lb/> 
not black vomit, in the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; of 1648 of Guadeloupe, which is generally<lb/> 
accepted as being yellow fever. The &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>&rdquo; of 1690 and later, in<lb/> 
Martinique, was certainly yellow fever. P&egrave;re Labat (1722, vol. i, page<lb/> 
73), who was on the island from 1694 to 1707, in his general description<lb/> 
of it, speaks of hemorrhages--&ldquo;the overflowing of blood from all the ori-<lb/> 
fices of the body, even by the pores&rdquo;--and excessive vomiting, even &ldquo;of<lb/> 
worms,&rdquo; but does not specifically mention black vomit.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p>
<p>It is not probable that the good father would have recognized black<lb/> 
vomit as being blood. Its appearance does not at all suggest blood,<lb/> 
unless, of course, in those extremely rare--and always fatal--cases in<lb/> 
which the hemorrhage is so profuse that the vomit is of <hi rend="italic">red</hi> unaltered<lb/> 
blood. Indeed, it was not until 1738 that Henry Warren showed that<lb/> 
black vomit was blood, altered by the gastric juices.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Even in 1806</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> In his own case (vol. i, p. 436) the &ldquo;much blood from&rdquo; (his) &ldquo;mouth&rdquo; which<lb/> 
showed early on the second day of his illness, must have been a hemorrhage from<lb/> 
the posterior nares and naso-pharynx. Much vomiting occurred later, so that he<lb/> 
could not take the sacrament, but no more is heard of the hemorrhage and nothing<lb/> 
of black vomit, and his physician did not regard him as dangerously ill. A large<lb/> 
gastric hemorrhage on the second day had been death.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>and 1807 &ldquo;the learned Bancroft&rdquo; (1811), in his Gulstonian Lectures of<lb/> 
those years, deems it necessary to argue <hi rend="italic">in extenso</hi> for this black vomit<lb/> 
being gastric hemorrhage; and James Johnson (1826, p. 287) is only<lb/> 
&ldquo;inclined&rdquo; to accept this view, which &ldquo;nearly coincides with that of<lb/> 
other accurate observers.&rdquo; Its nature was evidently not considered<lb/> 
beyond dispute even then.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Spanish Americans knew yellow fever as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">v&oacute;mito<lb/> 
prieto</hi>&rdquo;--black vomit--long before this symptom was given prominence<lb/> 
by the English. Indeed, a statement as to the nature of the vomit,<lb/> 
similar to that made by Warren, appears in the description of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo;<lb/> 
of 1648 in Yucatan--&ldquo;there followed some vomits as of rotted blood.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">4</hi><lb/> 
This &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; was certainly yellow fever.</p>
<p>For the positive side of this question, however, we can say that a fever<lb/> 
epidemic in a hot climate in which either of these two symptoms, hemor-<lb/>
rhage from about the mouth (always excluding scurvy) or black vomit,<lb/> 
the latter especially, was noted as of fairly frequent occurrence, must,<lb/> 
in the present state of our knowledge, be considered as having been<lb/> 
either yellow fever or one of the tick-borne spirochetoses, and very gener-<lb/>
ally the former. The writer knows of but two instances of such an epi-<lb/> 
demic being other than yellow fever; one in Senegal, reported by Noc and<lb/> 
Nogue (1921) and one in Barbados, investigated by Guiteras in 1916<lb/> 
(see Guiteras, 1917), which probably was also a spirochetosis. Both<lb/> 
showed a greater mortality among negroes than whites, and a longer<lb/> 
survival of fatal cases than is normal for yellow fever. There may have<lb/> 
been others of the same kind, however, not recognized.</p>
<p>Black vomit, under such conditions, in the Americas at least, is well-<lb/>
nigh pathognomonic of yellow fever. The Spanish Americans early<lb/> 
crystallized this idea in the name of the disease, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">v&oacute;mito prieto</hi>&rdquo;; and Sir<lb/> 
William Pym laid stress on it above all things. To <hi rend="italic">him</hi> black vomit<lb/> 
<hi rend="italic">was yellow fever</hi>; and hedging a very little, and expressing what I think<lb/>
he really intended, we may say that an epidemic of fever in which black<lb/> 
vomit is at all common is, in tropical America, almost certainly yellow<lb/> 
fever--but for the Barbados fever of 1916 and the possibility of tick-<lb/> 
borne spirochetoses, one would strike out the &ldquo;almost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DISEASES CONFUSED WITH YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
53</p>
<p>If this epidemic gives a much lower mortality among negroes than<lb/> 
among other races, if it be decidedly a civic rather than a rural disease, if<lb/> 
death is usually from the fifth to the seventh day, and second attacks<lb/> 
do not occur, the evidence for its being yellow fever seems impregna-<lb/>
ble, although it was strong enough before.</p>
<p>DISEASES TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the kind of records from which we must seek our<lb/>
information for the period with which we are chiefly concerned (to the<lb/>
middle of the seventeenth century) it is necessary to be at some pains to<lb/>
differentiate yellow fever in those records from various diseases which,<lb/>
in more recent literature, would hardly come into consideration for<lb/>
differential diagnosis. In fact, it is necessary at least to bring into<lb/>
the question such diseases as smallpox and measles, which would seem,<lb/>
from the modern viewpoint, to have almost nothing in common with<lb/>
yellow fever, except the likelihood of occurring in fatal epidemics.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Smallpox</hi></p>
<p>Introduced into America by the Europeans, smallpox was a scourge to<lb/> 
its native races, far less so to the Europeans, most of whom were immune<lb/> 
by previous attack. Naturally, when any description of the disease<lb/> 
itself is given, no matter by whom made, there would be no possibility of<lb/> 
mistaking smallpox for yellow fever, or the reverse.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Measles</hi></p>
<p>What is said of smallpox applies to measles, to a less degree maybe<lb/> 
It was less certain of recognition, less deadly to the Indians, and negli-<lb/>
gible in its effects on Europeans. While not by any means the scourge<lb/> 
that smallpox was, measles was quite fatal to the American natives,<lb/> 
even in the tropics. Where it was cold, it was to them a deadly pesti-<lb/>
lence. When one hears, then, of fatal epidemics among the Indians, or<lb/> 
any primitive race, following their contact with Europeans, one must--<lb/>
unless the description of the disease negative them--consider smallpox<lb/> 
and measles as possibilities. Where there is no description, and the</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> The picture writings of the Aztecs (<hi rend="italic">Codex Aubin</hi>, p. 85 and <hi rend="italic">Codex Telleriano-<lb/> 
Remensis</hi>, in many places) plainly show the terrible epidemic of smallpox intro-<lb/>
duced into Mexico in 1520 by a negro sick of that disease, in the train of Narvaez,<lb/> 
and which did much to break the resistance to Cortez. It was known as &ldquo;great-<lb/> 
fire&rdquo; (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Nohkakil</hi>&rdquo;)by the Mayas after it came to them, and even the far less cul-<lb/>
tured tribes in North America soon learned, to their sorrow, to know it well.</p>
<pb n="54" id="Cb000068"/>
<p>54<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>disease does not seriously affect, and is not noticed by, the Europeans<lb/> 
who are in contact with it, the evidence for its being one or the other is<lb/> 
strengthened, although typhus or influenza are not to be excluded.</p>
<p>Such was &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la modorra</hi>&rdquo; (&ldquo;the lethargy&rdquo;) which destroyed a good part<lb/> 
of the Guanches of Teneriffe in 1494 after the battle of Laguna. Accord-<lb/>
ing to Espinosa (trans., 1907, p. 105) the Spaniards went freely into the<lb/> 
stricken territory, bringing back some captives--&ldquo;owing to the pestilence,<lb/> 
gur people did not meet much resistance&rdquo;--and are not noted as suffer-<lb/>
ing any sickness, except from the roughness of the country and the<lb/> 
scarcity of provisions, nor as being concerned about that among the<lb/> 
Guanches. Finlay (1904) suggests this epidemic as being yellow fever,<lb/> 
and as such it is accepted by Augustin (1909, p. 180). No description<lb/> 
is given of this disease, but from its epidemiology it could not have been<lb/> 
yellow fever, and either smallpox, typhus, influenza, or measles--all<lb/> 
four prevalent in Spain about this time--seems the most probable<lb/> 
diagnosis. One of the first two may seem necessary to account for<lb/> 
the heavy mortality, and there had been a severe epidemic of typhus<lb/> 
in Spain in 1489 and 1490 at the siege of Granada. Yet its rapid pro-<lb/>
gress<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> and the fact that the chronicler does not mention that it was small-<lb/> 
pox and that the Spaniards paid absolutely no attention to it seem, to<lb/> 
the writer, to make measles at least probable. Measles, in a virgin race<lb/> 
in a mountain climate, and aided by the privations following an unsuc-<lb/>
cessful war, might well make a heavy mortality.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi></p>
<p>This disease is recorded as epidemic in Europe, in France, Germany, or<lb/> 
England, quite frequently, certainly six or eight times from 1403 to 1600.<lb/> 
In Spain, Villalba (1803) reports it epidemic as &ldquo;el catarro&rdquo; in 1580<lb/> 
and many times thereafter. Judging from our recent experience, it<lb/> 
would have had a good chance to cross to North America from the north-<lb/>
ern countries--by Breton, Scandinavian, and British fishermen, espe<lb/>
cially--much less, to reach the lower latitudes in the yellow fever zone.</p>
<p>The writer is sure that no epidemic of influenza in Europe was reported<lb/> 
as yellow fever, nor was the contrary mistake made. The same seems to<lb/> 
have been true also for tropical America in early times. Yet influenza<lb/> 
must be considered as a probability in the great epidemic which occurred<lb/> 
among the Indians on the New England coast about 1618 and which was</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">6</hi> &ldquo;A woman of the island announced the pestilence. . . . asking why they did not<lb/> 
come up and occupy the land, for there was no one to fight, no one to fear, all<lb/>

<p>the salvation of the Plymouth colonists. Noah Webster (1799, vol.<lb/> 
1, pp. 176-179) gives a detailed account of this and considers it to have<lb/> 
been yellow fever. Since it occurred during the winter, this disease<lb/> 
need not be considered, spite of the statement of his Indian informants<lb/> 
that the sick were as yellow as the piece of yellow cloth he showed them.<lb/> 
It could well have been influenza, being in the part of America into which<lb/> 
it would have been most readily introduced. Measles is another ten-<lb/>
able, but perhaps less probable, supposition. Smallpox, Webster had<lb/> 
specifically excluded.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi></p>
<p>Whether &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">el bicho</hi>&rdquo; (&ldquo;the worm&rdquo;), epidemic at Lima in 1781 according<lb/> 
to Leblond (1805), was yellow fever, as reported by him, or grippe, is un-<lb/>
certain. The evidence is not definitely determinative, but to the writer<lb/> 
renders the diagnosis of yellow fever much the more probable.</p>
<p>The very widespread epidemic on the Andean plateau in 1759, which<lb/> 
gave rise to the report of yellow fever in Quito, was, the writer believes,<lb/> 
influenza. Why it should ever have been considered yellow fever it is<lb/> 
hard to say, as its first appearance in the highlands of Peru was &ldquo;in the<lb/> 
time of ices&rdquo; (Ulloa, 1772, p. 200).</p>
<p>Clinically, the two diseases, seen as epidemics, are sufficiently dis-<lb/>
tinct, yet the writer investigated, in 1920, two small epidemics of grippe<lb/> 
in Peru reported as yellow fever, and in 1921 a larger one of yellow fever,<lb/> 
reported (among other things) as grippe &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">&agrave; la forma g&aacute;strica</hi>.&rdquo; In<lb/> 
Louisiana, in 1918, a number of physicians familiar with yellow fever<lb/> 
regarded the influenza epidemic with suspicion, and a few were near<lb/> 
reporting it as yellow fever. To the writer, there seems no reason to<lb/> 
mistake them clinically--seen in fair sized groups.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Dysentery</hi></p>
<p>With a clinical description of either disease, dysentery and yellow<lb/> 
fever would never be confounded. Yet in accounts of epidemics among<lb/> 
English troops and, to a less degree, colonists, in America, &ldquo;fevers and<lb/> 
fluxes&rdquo; are frequently grouped in both the morbidity and mortality re-</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> The experiences of the writer with the American aborigines, both, in investi-<lb/>
gating an epidemic, which had occurred among the San Blas Indians, suspected<lb/> 
of having been yellow fever, and at other times, is that they, when really friendly,<lb/> 
carry their courtesy so far that one is pretty apt to get the information <hi rend="italic">they<lb/> 
think</hi> he wants, let the facts be as they may. We were assured by the San Blas<lb/> 
that black vomit had been frequent and abundant; that most deaths were in con-<lb/>
vulsions--dramatically illustrated; that the eyes of the sick and dead were as<lb/> 
yellow as the gold coin exhibited. Yet from epidemiological evidence and the<lb/> 
examination of three convalescents, we were able, positively and without any<lb/> 
doubt, to determine this epidemic as having been grippe.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p> 
<p>ports. Dysentery, too, seems to have been one of the diseases which,<lb/> 
with syphilis and fevers, was frequently grouped as one morbific entity<lb/> 
by the early American historians. Obviously, then, when we simply<lb/> 
hear of a great sickness--especially in an army--in the tropics, with no<lb/> 
description of its nature, the chance of dysentery's being a factor in it<lb/> 
is to be considered.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Plague, bubonic or pneumonic</hi></p>
<p>During the time with which we are concerned, plague was always pres-<lb/>
ent in the Levant, and from time to time prevailed as extensive and deadly<lb/> 
epidemics in most parts of Europe and North Africa. By these charac-<lb/>
teristics, then, it could not be distinguished from yellow fever. It can<lb/> 
occur, however, in cold weather as well as in hot, and is far less apt to<lb/> 
show as a ship disease.</p>
<p>The symptomology of plague is different enough from that of yellow<lb/> 
fever, and one might expect excessive vomiting, hemorrhages by the<lb/> 
mouth, and jaundice to be noted in yellow fever, and the bubo in<lb/> 
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">8</hi> This latter was well known as a sign of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; to both laity<lb/> 
and physicians in Europe. Where the nosology, however, included<lb/> 
syphilis as well as some other diseases under one head--&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la epid&eacute;mia</hi>,&rdquo;<lb/> 
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la enfermedad</hi>&rdquo;--as was the case with that of all early epidemics in<lb/> 
America--the presence of buboes need not imply &ldquo;peste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As &ldquo;peste&rdquo; and typhus, held to be &ldquo;the same in essence,&rdquo; were, in the<lb/> 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, regarded as the types of &ldquo;pestilen-<lb/> 
tial,&rdquo; that is, communicable, diseases, their characteristic marks, buboes<lb/> 
and petechial spots, were invariably sought for whenever there was sus-<lb/>
picion that the disease occurring might be of such a character; and the<lb/> 
occurrence of either was considered strong evidence of its so being. Not<lb/> 
only were typhus and plague held to be the same, but the general teach-<lb/>
ing was that all fevers were identical in nature, differing only in degree<lb/> 
and the temperament of the sufferer.<hi rend="superscript">9</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">8</hi> Yet Henry Warren--a physician of excellent reputation--writing in 1740,<lb/> 
regards &ldquo;this malignant fever,&rdquo; afterwards called &ldquo;yellow fever&rdquo; by Hughes<lb/> 
(1750), as the Levantine plague, and states that it was brought to Barbados about<lb/> 
1723 by the British man-of-war, <hi rend="italic">Lynn</hi>, from Martinique, and again in 1733 was<lb/> 
conveyed from Martinique, where it had been introduced in baled goods by a<lb/> 
Marseilles vessel, from St. Jean d' Acre. Ligon (1673, p. 21), too, a layman, states<lb/> 
that &ldquo;the Plague, or as killing a disease,&rdquo; was prevalent in Barbados in 1647 when<lb/> 
he landed there. Whether this was yellow fever we do not know, but it may well<lb/> 
have been.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">9</hi> Arejula, even in 1806, is just bold enough to differentiate between &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>,&rdquo;<lb/> 
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">epid&eacute;mia</hi>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">cont&aacute;gio</hi>&rdquo;; and he cautiously suggests that they are &ldquo;as it were&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="57" id="Cb000071"/>
<p>DISEASES CONFUSED WITH YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
57</p>
<p>We have said that &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; is far less apt to show as a ship disease than<lb/> 
yellow fever, and, indeed, their behavior aboard ship should furnish<lb/> 
valid points for differentiation between these two diseases. If in the<lb/> 
pneumonic form, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; aboard ship would be apt to occur as an epi-<lb/>
demic (as would yellow fever if there were sufficient active <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> aboard)<lb/> 
and with a case mortality of near or quite 100 per cent. The mortality<lb/> 
of yellow fever, although high, is, even aboard ship, less than that of<lb/> 
pneumonic plague. Such an outbreak of plague would be quickly over,<lb/> 
however, and would be more apt to begin in cold climates than in hot.<lb/> 
A considerable number of cases of bubonic plague might be caused<lb/> 
aboard ship by the presence of infected rats, and more, probably, when<lb/> 
the forecastle was below deck, as in old times, than in present-day vessels.<lb/> 
Even then, however, one would scarcely think that an epidemic could be<lb/> 
thus caused, certainly not such an explosion as sometimes happens with<lb/> 
yellow fever. Under such conditions, bubonic plague might well be<lb/> 
long continued aboard ship, even longer than yellow fever, and give a<lb/> 
high mortality, equal eventually to that of severe yellow fever, but less<lb/> 
than that of the pneumonic form of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering the close association of men aboard ship, it does not seem<lb/> 
reasonable that any considerable number of her personnel could develop<lb/> 
bubonic plague without the existence of the buboes being noted: they<lb/> 
would certainly be looked for, and, being painful and tender, would be<lb/> 
easy to find. For the pneumonic form, one must depend on the epidemi-<lb/>
ological picture--the short, excessively virulent epidemic, beginning<lb/> 
very soon after leaving an infected port, and, in general, in a cold climate.</p>
<p>That &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; is rare aboard ships in modern times is evidenced by the<lb/> 
fact that during the present pandemic, now nearly thirty years old,<lb/> 
there has been reported, the writer thinks, no <hi rend="italic">epidemic</hi> of either pneu-<lb/>
monic or bubonic plague aboard ships on the high seas, although some<lb/> 
vessels have shown scattered cases of the latter form aboard, and a large<lb/> 
number have carried infected rats. Nearly all of the ports infected dur-<lb/>
ing this pandemic have been in warm or temperate climates.</p>
<p>Quite certainly there was never plague in America before 1898, and the<lb/> 
Levantine &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; which Warren claims was brought to Martinique and<lb/> 
later to Barbados from Martinique in 1733, was as certainly yellow fever.</p>
<p>There is to me no question but that the epidemic of 1694 at Rochefort<lb/> 
--a very celebrated one, as leading to the first maritime quarantine</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>species of the same genus, although &ldquo;the teaching of the schools is that they differ<lb/> 
only by the existence in greater or less degree of the conditions producing them.&rdquo;</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>against yellow fever from the French Antilles--reported by Chirac<lb/>
(1742) and accepted by La Roche (1855, vol. i, p. 48) and by Audouard<lb/>
(1824) as yellow fever, was plague. Chirac speaks of axillary and par-<lb/>
otid buboes as common, although fewer in the groins. It seems rather<lb/>
strange that the earliest protective measures against the introduction of<lb/>
yellow fever should have been taken under a misapprehension.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Relapsing fever (&ldquo;famine fever&rdquo;) and spirochetal diseases generally</hi></p>
<p>These are insect-borne diseases, lice or ticks being the vectors.<lb/>
&ldquo;Famine fever,&rdquo; louse-borne, was a scourge in the Middle Ages and up to<lb/>
the early part of the nineteenth century. It occurred in widespread<lb/>
epidemics with the misery following wars, and with a high mortality<lb/>
among the half starved people. Todd (1922) gives the case fatality as 60<lb/>
per cent among Rumanian prisoners during the Great War, and 80 per-<lb/>
cent in India, where the native treatment is strict diet. Lind (1792, p.<lb/>
188), on the authority of Sir John Elliott, gives the mortality at Naples<lb/>
in 1764 as 200,000 out of 2,000,000 population--doubtless an estimate<lb/>
only, but undoubtedly of a severe epidemic, and which probably was<lb/>
mixed with typhus.</p>
<p>The diseases of this group occur both in cold and in hot weather, lice<lb/>
naturally thriving best in the former and ticks in the latter.<hi rend="superscript">10</hi></p>
<p>The tick-borne infection of <hi rend="italic">Spironema duttoni</hi> seems to be in general de-<lb/>
cidedly milder than that of the louse-borne <hi rend="italic">S. obermeieri</hi> (Gouzien, 1924).<lb/>
Brumpt (1922, pp. 53-56) states that each of these organisms has its own<lb/>
vector, that the organism of tick-fever is not conveyed by lice, and that<lb/>
experimental conveyance of louse-borne fever by ticks is doubtful.<lb/>
This implies that the parasites of the two forms are essentially different.<lb/>
Todd (1922), however, classes them both as <hi rend="italic">S. recurrentis</hi>, and prefers to<lb/>
describe &ldquo;the relapsing fevers as one disease which presents unimportant<lb/>
local modifications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symptoms in some epidemics may be quite like those of yellow<lb/>
fever: profound jaundice; hemorrhages, including gastric hemorrhages,<lb/>
and hence black vomit. And, unless the occurrence of relapses was noted,<lb/>
or that death came less quickly in such cases, no difference in symptoms<lb/>
from those of yellow fever would be apt to be recorded by lay historians,<lb/>
or even by physicians. Unless, then, they occurred in cold weather, it<lb/>
might not be easy for us to differentiate such epidemics from those of<lb/>
yellow fever. A diagnostic differential in epidemics among a mixed</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">10</hi> Relapsing fever (lice-borne) is prevalent in the Punjab, but only in the cold<lb/>
season (Cragg, 1922).</p>

<p>population of whites and negroes would be that relapsing fever is as<lb/>
fatal among the latter as the former. It is also less apt to be confined to<lb/>
towns and cities--that is, may be a rural as well as an urban disease,<lb/>
which is less usual with yellow fever.</p>
<p>The fever which La Roche (1855, vol. i, p. 582) mentions on the<lb/>
authority of Arrott, as occurring at Dundee in 1843 and as presenting<lb/>
&ldquo;on some points, a resemblance to yellow fever,&rdquo; and the small epidemic<lb/>
of 21 cases and 17 deaths in the winter of 1826 and 1827 at Dublin, were<lb/>
quite certainly spirochetal infections--probably &ldquo;famine fever.&rdquo; Yet<lb/>
both Graves (1848, p. 301) and Stokes (1876, pp. 110-111), clinicians<lb/>
of the first order, but unfamiliar with yellow fever, considered the<lb/>
latter as &ldquo;the yellow fever of the West Indies.&rdquo; Arrott (1844, p. 133)<lb/>
says: &ldquo;The similarity of the symptoms during life and of the morbid<lb/>
appearances observed after death, so nearly agree with the descriptions<lb/>
of yellow fever of the West Indies, and with the minute accounts of the<lb/>
Gibraltar epidemic of 1828, given by Louis, as to leave little doubt on<lb/>
my mind that the only difference between these diseases and the Dundee<lb/>
epidemic, if difference there be, is a difference in degree and not in kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the same fever in Edinburgh, Cormack (1843) writes that it<lb/>
corresponded closely with the description of yellow fever of the West<lb/>
Indies as given by Sir Gilbert Blane, a well known writer on yellow<lb/>
fever, of which he had seen much in the West Indies.</p>
<p>Neither Craigie (1843) nor David Smith (1844), who reported epi-<lb/>
demics in 1843 in Edinburgh and Leith, regarded it as &ldquo;the yellow fever<lb/>
of the West Indies.&rdquo; The mortality was not high enough and &ldquo;many<lb/>
patients showed no vomiting of blood.&rdquo; This was clearly relapsing<lb/>
fever. Craigie gives 110 relapses out of 182 cases after the patients<lb/>
had been up and about for four to six days. The first cases observed<lb/>
in Edinburgh were in March.</p>
<p>For an epidemic occurring in a hot, tropical country, and hence quite<lb/>
surely &ldquo;tick fever,&rdquo; Cornilliac (1873, p. 375) quotes McAuliffe concern-<lb/>
ing an epidemic of relapsing fever at Reunion (date not given): &ldquo;I even<lb/>
believe that it would be impossible to clearly distinguish these affec-<lb/>
tions&rdquo; (relapsing and yellow fever) &ldquo;if both raged at the same time in a<lb/>
community.&rdquo; Both seem to have occurred simultaneously, or nearly<lb/>
so, in the district about Bucaramanga, in Colombia, in the summer and<lb/>
fall of 1923.</p>
<p>The epidemic at Quebec, reported as yellow fever by Walsh in 1806,<lb/>
and the subject of considerable controversy, was clinically a spirocheto-<lb/>
sis (it is well described), but possibly not from the organism of Ober-<lb/>

meier. The recent epidemic of spirochetosis in Senegal, reported by<lb/>
Noc and Nogue (1921) was, except for its occurrence in a hot country,<lb/>
more like the one in Dundee. It showed black vomit, which the Quebec<lb/>
epidemic did not; but relapses and a greater mortality among blacks<lb/>
than whites.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Typhus fever</hi></p>
<p>This, also an insect-borne disease, was more widely distributed even<lb/>
than plague in the times that we are considering and, especially when<lb/>
epidemic, had a high mortality. What it can do under unfavorable sani-<lb/>
tary conditions even in modern times is shown by the Serbian outbreak<lb/>
in 1914-1915. Its vector being the body-louse--possibly other man-<lb/>
infesting lice as well--naturally it occurs by preference in cold weather.<lb/>
It is also less essentially a civic disease than yellow fever.</p>
<p>The symptomologies of the two diseases, yellow fever and typhus,<lb/>
would seem to be very different, almost contrasting, yet they were re-<lb/>
garded as the same, or at least as kindred diseases, &ldquo;modified by climate<lb/>
and marine conditions,&rdquo; by many of the leaders of the medical profession<lb/>
in Europe, most of whom had little experience with yellow fever. Even<lb/>
as late as 1866, Anstie (1866, p. 86) writes that from &ldquo;the histories of<lb/>
West Indian epidemics&rdquo; he believes that &ldquo;the disease&rdquo; (yellow fever)<lb/>
&ldquo;has strong affinities with our English typhus . . . . that were these<lb/>
fevers&rdquo; (typhus and relapsing fevers) &ldquo;transplanted to the . . . . tropical<lb/>
regions . . . . they would develop these features on which so much stress<lb/>
is laid&rdquo; (jaundice and black vomit) &ldquo;with constancy, instead of occa-<lb/>
sionally, and would then be indistinguishable from the yellow fever.&rdquo;<lb/>
Stress was laid on the &ldquo;essential similarity&rdquo; between the petechial spots,<lb/>
considered pathognomonic of typhus, and the livid spots (indeed from<lb/>
a similar mechanism) in yellow fever. These petechial spots, as well as<lb/>
buboes, were very generally sought for when there was a question of<lb/>
an illness being &ldquo;pestilential,&rdquo; i.e., contagious. &ldquo;American typhus&rdquo;<lb/>
and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">typhus icteroides</hi>&rdquo; were designations for yellow fever for many years.<lb/>
Indeed, the latter is still common in the mortality records in Spanish<lb/>
America.</p>
<p>The differential here is unusually clear. Typhus never continues as<lb/>
an epidemic in a hot climate nor yellow fever in a cold one. We may<lb/>
therefore exclude typhus from our consideration of epidemic diseases in<lb/>
the endemic yellow fever zone of America. In the Old World, however,<lb/>
the case is different, and typhus may well have been reported as yellow<lb/>
fever in Europe. It was certainly typhus and not yellow fever which<lb/>

ravaged Catalonia in 1764 and later, as described by Masdevall (1786, p.<lb/>
18 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>).</p>
<p>Whether the fever of 1822 in Paris, with jaundice, black vomit, and<lb/>
petechiae, was typhus may be a question. Lassis (quoted by Augustin,<lb/>
p. 392) and Robert (1826, vol. i, p. 104), who was familiar with yellow<lb/>
fever, reported it as yellow fever; and Magendie (1842, vol. 1, p. 117),<lb/>
who mentioned 11 cases in hospital, confirmed the existence of these<lb/>
symptoms. It was almost certainly not yellow fever. The case mor-<lb/>
tality was too low and the patients were sick too long. It was more prob-<lb/>
ably some spirochetal infection rather than typhus. The single autopsy<lb/>
(Andral's) reported by La Roche (vol. i, pp. 272-273) may have been<lb/>
typhoid. This probably is the basis of La Roche's opinion that the<lb/>
epidemic was of &ldquo;typhoid fever, modified by the extreme heat of the<lb/>
season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Villalba (1803, vol. i, p. 112) states that typhus, epidemic in Spain<lb/>
since about 1557, had been introduced into Mexico in or before 1570 and<lb/>
made great ravages in the City of Mexico, where it was described under<lb/>
the name &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tabardete</hi>&rdquo; by Dr. Francisco Bravo.</p>
<p>Was the famed &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matlazahuatl</hi>&rdquo; accredited with such ravages on the<lb/>
Mexican Plateau in 1545, 1576, 1736, 1737, 1761, and 1762, the typhus,<lb/>
introduced from Spain, or was it some indigenous disease, existing from<lb/>
pre-Columbian times? The general belief is the latter. This the writer<lb/>
is inclined to doubt. It is true that one of these epidemics is recorded<lb/>
in Mexico in 1545, which is prior to the recognized introduction of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">el<lb/>
tabardillo</hi>&rdquo; from Spain and, indeed, prior to the date (1557) of the mother<lb/>
epidemic in that country. Yet, as this disease had existed in Spain at<lb/>
the siege of Granada in 1489-90--brought by soldiers from Cyprus--<lb/>
and appeared again soon after the Civil Wars (1518-20) it could have<lb/>
been introduced into Mexico earlier than Villalba reports. We are quite<lb/>
sure that it was introduced in 1526. This whole matter will be consid-<lb/>
ered later in the discussion of the &ldquo;Place of Origin of Yellow Fever.&rdquo;<lb/>
It is enough to say here:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) In spite of the hemorrhagic symptoms accredited to it, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matlaza-<lb/>
huatl</hi>&rdquo; was not yellow fever, as it prevailed on the high plateau, where<lb/>
yellow fever has never been known to spread, and, in 1576 at least, it<lb/>
occurred during a period of unusual cold, even for that altitude. There<lb/>
is no account of it in the <hi rend="italic">tierra caliente</hi>.</item>
<item>(2) The epidemic of 1576 was called &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tabardillo</hi>&rdquo; by Mendieta<lb/>
(p. 515), a contemporary historian.</item>

<pb n="62" id="Cb000076"/>
62<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">el tabardillo</hi>,&rdquo; and seems to be identical with that in Europe and North<lb/>
Africa; and, save an occasional epidemic of smallpox, we know of no<lb/>
other very fatal epidemic disease there.</item>
</list></p>
<p>Several epidemics of a fever of very high mortality, characterized by<lb/>
blood from the mouth and nose, and by jaundice, occurred also in the<lb/>
Andean plateau, from Potos&iacute; and Cerro de Pasco to Quito and Popayan,<lb/>
in 1720 and subsequently. By some Spanish writers, these also were<lb/>
called &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matlazahuatl</hi>,&rdquo; this name quite certainly being copied from that<lb/>
given similar epidemics in Mexico, of which they had heard. The very<lb/>
widespread and fatal epidemic of 1759, noted, and to an extent, de-<lb/>
scribed by Antonio de Ulloa (1772, p. 200 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>), was, in the opinion of<lb/>
the writer, quite certainly one of influenzal pneumonia; but in other<lb/>
epidemics petechial eruptions were noted, and the conditions under<lb/>
which they occurred and their epidemiology leave no doubt of their<lb/>
being typhus. Some of the others may have been relapsing fever, or<lb/>
even the two occurring simultaneously.</p>
<p>It is these epidemics that gave rise to the statement, so often ascribed<lb/>
to Humboldt, that yellow fever had prevailed as an epidemic in Quito.<lb/>
I cannot find that he ever made it. Certainly even the Andean foot-<lb/>
hills in Peru were free from <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in 1920-21.<hi rend="superscript">11</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Scurvy</hi></p>
<p>This could scarcely occur in the tropics except aboard ships, and yet<lb/>
might enormously increase the disability, and indeed the mortality, of<lb/>
even mild diseases in men just landed with it. It is doubtless this<lb/>
which Dr. Chanca (Monte y Tejada, 1853, p. 298) had in mind when he<lb/>
instanced the bad voyage--&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la mala pasada del camino</hi>&rdquo;--as being a<lb/>
cause of the sickness occurring in the second expedition of Columbus<lb/>
when they landed in 1493 on Hispaniola; and he was in all probability<lb/>
right, no matter what other causes may also have been active. The<lb/>
same may well have been a principal factor in the sickness, associated<lb/>
with want and privation, in the Dutch garrison at Valdivia (Chile) in<lb/>
1643, which B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud counts as probably yellow fever--why,<lb/>
one does not know. They had just completed a very long and arduous<lb/>
voyage and had landed on a desolate, barren coast. On the other hand,<lb/>
scurvy would never last any length of time ashore in the tropics of</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">11</hi> Some of the Mexican epidemics may well have been mixed ones, of typhus<lb/>
and relapsing fever, or some other spirochetosis, such as is now (1922) prevailing<lb/>
in Poland and the Ukraine. They have the same vector. The whole subject will, 
however, be discussed later.</p>

<p>DISEASES CONFUSED WITH YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
63</p>
<p>America (Valdivia is in lat. 40&deg; S.): there is too much vegetation<lb/>
available.</p>
<p>Scurvy was little, if at all, known as a ship disease prior to the dis-<lb/>
covery of America: prolonged voyages were rare before that time. Vil-<lb/>
lalba (1803, vol. i, p. 76) quotes from Jo&atilde;o de Barros, an early Portu-<lb/>
guese writer, a description of a severe outbreak of scurvy aboard the<lb/>
squadron of Vasco da Gama, after passing the Cape of Good Hope in<lb/>
1498. The narrator evidently regards it as a hitherto unknown disease,<lb/>
and Villalba thinks the same. It soon, however, became too well known<lb/>
aboard ship to be there mistaken for anything else; but when we have no<lb/>
account of the <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> of a sickness which continues to prevail aboard<lb/>
ship on a long voyage, one naturally thinks first of scurvy. Thus, the<lb/>
loss of 54 out of 70 colonists for St. Christophe (from Brest) aboard the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Cardinal before</hi> they landed, and &ldquo;the most of the others half dead&rdquo;<lb/>
(du Tertre, 1667, vol. i, p. 15), implies scurvy.</p>
<p>It may be noted here that the dead of scurvy in some points resemble<lb/>
those dead of yellow fever, and that hemorrhages from the gums and into<lb/>
the cutaneous connective tissue are common in both scorbutics and yel-<lb/>
low fever patients.</p>
<p>Even as late as 1762, Monchy, a Dutch naval surgeon, who should<lb/>
have been familiar with scurvy and yellow fever as well, opines that<lb/>
&ldquo;the malignant fevers&rdquo; (of the West Indies) &ldquo;are of the same nature with<lb/>
the scurvy,&rdquo; and quotes with approval the grouping by &ldquo;the judicious<lb/>
Pringle&rdquo; of &ldquo;all these putrid diseases,&rdquo; scurvy, putrid and malignant<lb/>
fevers, and dysentery, into one class. Monchy also had &ldquo;seen the simple<lb/>
remittents degenerate into the putrid yellow fever of the West Indies&rdquo;--<lb/>
from an increase of intensity of the causal agent.</p>
<p>Spite of the fanciful nature of the above, one must always consider<lb/>
the possibility of scurvy in epidemics aboard ship. Nor can one differ-<lb/>
entiate it from yellow fever, also frequently a ship disease, by the differ-<lb/>
ence in mortality. In long voyages, scurvy was sometimes a scourge,<lb/>
as in Anson's voyage around the world in 1740-44 (Bruce, 1759). In<lb/>
any detailed account, however, the epidemiologies of the two diseases<lb/>
should allow of differentiation. Scurvy would not begin until a con-<lb/>
siderable time had elapsed after leaving a port at which fresh provisions<lb/>
were taken aboard, or where the men had been allowed ashore enough to<lb/>
eat an abundance of fresh things. Yellow fever, or any other infection<lb/>
taken on at the port, should show shortly after leaving it. Scurvy would,<lb/>
and yellow fever might, increase indefinitely, both in severity and in the<lb/>
number of those sickening, as the time at sea lengthened, becoming ex-<lb/>
<pb n="64" id="Cb000078"/>
64<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
tremely bad in very long voyages, while, given time enough, yellow fever<lb/>
would culminate, diminish, and, in a very long voyage, disappear. There<lb/>
would be no deaths in the early part of an epidemic of scurvy, while these<lb/>
would increase rapidly as it continued. The case mortality of yellow<lb/>
fever would, or might, be nearly as great at the beginning as at any other<lb/>
time. Men who develop scurvy and continue at sea under the same<lb/>
conditions do not get well but, if they get up, go down again and again,<lb/>
and become gradually worse. Those who recover from yellow fever<lb/>
suffer no second attack and get well; slowly and imperfectly, it may be,<lb/>
from improper food and hardship, but they do get well. Finally, from<lb/>
the very nature of scurvy, it rarely attacks the cabin or the galley until<lb/>
the forecastle is decimated. The writer has seen quite an amount of it,<lb/>
and has had to quiet one mutiny from men who believed that they were<lb/>
poisoned by their officers, else &ldquo;Why should we be all sick and dying and<lb/>
all of them, and the cook too, well?&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Dengue</hi></p>
<p>Another insect-borne disease and, since it is conveyed by the <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi><lb/>
mosquito (possibly not exclusively), naturally dengue occurs under much<lb/>
the same conditions as yellow fever. The parasite has, however, a much<lb/>
wider geographical distribution.</p>
<p>The first definitely recognizable account of dengue in America is that<lb/>
of Stedman (1828) at St. Thomas, 1827-28. It was reported as having<lb/>
been brought by a vessel from Africa, but &ldquo;this is not ascertained.&rdquo;<lb/>
Whether it existed in America before may be a question.<hi rend="superscript">12</hi> Since that<lb/>
time it has quite certainly been frequently present in tropical America,<lb/>
but has been noted rarely except in the United States. It is extremely<lb/>
like mild yellow fever; so like, that, in the first stage, differentiation is 
generally impossible.</p>
<p>To judge by the records, dengue has been of wider dissemination and<lb/>
more frequent occurrence in the Levant--Eastern Asia and North<lb/>
Africa--where it probably originated. The writer thinks that its occur-<lb/>
rence in tropical America has frequently not been recognized. When<lb/>
not epidemic, it has been grouped, by the Spanish, with the &ldquo;acclimating<lb/>
fevers,&rdquo; and, by the French, with the &ldquo;inflammatory fevers,&rdquo; with which,<lb/>
when yellow fever existed, were also grouped many mild cases of the latter<lb/>
disease. One epidemic at least, that of 1860 at Martinique, reported</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">12</hi> The account of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; at Guadeloupe in 1635, as given by du<lb/>
Tertre (1667-1671, vol. i, p. 81), fits dengue better than yellow fever, but was prob-<lb/>
ably neither. This will be taken up in its place. (See Part iii, chapter xi.)</p>
<pb n="65" id="Cb000079"/>
<p>DISEASES CONFUSED WITH YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
65</p>
<p>by Ballot (1870) as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">fi&egrave;vre inflammatoire</hi>,&rdquo; was unquestionably dengue.<lb/>
Rufz de Lavison (1869, p. 75) states that a previous epidemic of dengue<lb/>
there had been known as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la giraffe</hi>.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">13</hi></p>
<p>Dengue is practically not a fatal disease, and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is our differential<lb/>
for epidemics of yellow fever and dengue. When Fernan del Busto y<lb/>
Blanco (quoted by Le Roy de M&eacute;ricourt, 1867) gives an epidemic of<lb/>
yellow fever in Teneriffe in 1828 with over 5,000 cases and 60 deaths,<lb/>
dengue is the first thing of which one thinks. Although M'Kinlay<lb/>
(1852, p. 341) is quite sure that the &ldquo;polka fever&rdquo; of Brazil (1845-1848)<lb/>
was yellow fever, he questions whether this name &ldquo;polka fever&rdquo; ever<lb/>
would have entered into medical nosology had it not been a cherished<lb/>
tradition that yellow fever could not exist in Brazil. Yet when he adds<lb/>
that, except as a contributing cause of death in very weak people, it was<lb/>
practically without mortality, one questions his diagnosis.</p>
<p>Of its relation to yellow fever, he says, &ldquo;this &lsquo;polka fever&rsquo; had been<lb/>
yearly becoming more severe, until, in 1849, a fatal yellow fever was<lb/>
developed,&rdquo; i.e. from the &ldquo;polka fever,&rdquo; or for which this had prepared<lb/>
the ground. This idea--the transformation of dengue fever into yellow<lb/>
fever, or its r&ocirc;le as a forerunner of yellow fever--is common in the Ameri-<lb/>
can literature of the last half of the nineteenth century (see Dutroulau's</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">13</hi> Dutroulau (1868, p. 131)--one of the princes in American or French tropical<lb/>
medicine--says of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">fi&egrave;vre inflammatoire</hi>:&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">C'est la racine de la fi&egrave;vre jaune<lb/>
dans ce climat</hi>.&rdquo; He is speaking of that of the French Antilles. The claim<lb/>
that yellow fever existed continuously in the French Antilles as the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">fi&egrave;vre inflam-<lb/>
matoire</hi>&rdquo;--the so-called &ldquo;larval form of yellow fever&rdquo;--is, I think, without basis<lb/>
in fact. The fact that a company of young men, raised in Martinique, after a<lb/>
prolonged period of quiescence (of yellow fever) were decimated by yellow fever<lb/>
in Vera Cruz, where they had gone with Bazaine's expedition of 1862 (Corre,<lb/>
1882, p. 63), seems sufficient evidence of this.</p>
<p>These islands freed themselves from the infection of yellow fever from time to<lb/>
time, as did others. As to the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">fi&egrave;vre inflammatoire</hi>,&rdquo; it included mild cases of<lb/>
yellow fever, when yellow fever was present; dengue, when dengue was present;<lb/>
some cases of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">embarras gastrique</hi>&rdquo;; and any other acute febrile manifestation--an<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">omnium gatherum</hi>&rdquo; of acute febrile attacks not otherwise classified.</p>
<p>The writer saw dengue in Porto Rico (1915) mistaken for, and reported as, yel-<lb/>
low fever. As &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">el trancaso</hi>,&rdquo; it was quite well known on the island, to the laity<lb/>
at all events, occurring from time to time as epidemics of greater or less extent in<lb/>
the towns, villages, and large plantations. This one was at San Juan, and the<lb/>
town was full of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>--that is, the soil prepared for yellow fever. This Porto<lb/>
Rican term &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">trancaso</hi>&rdquo;--&ldquo;a lick&rdquo; (meaning a blow)--is identical with that, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup<lb/>
de barre</hi>,&rdquo; used to designate the fever of Guadaloupe in 1635. Both express the<lb/>
sudden onset of the crippling pains which mark dengue and, quite generally,<lb/>
yellow fever as well.</p>
<pb n="66" id="Cb000080"/>
<p>66<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>statement in footnote on page 65). This is natural; the presence of<lb/>
dengue implies the prevalence of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, and only the introduction of<lb/>
the micro&ouml;rganism of yellow fever is necessary for the occurrence of<lb/>
that disease. The &ldquo;polka fever&rdquo; was evidence of an infestation of the<lb/>
Brazilian coast towns with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> and, to that extent, a sign that the<lb/>
ground was prepared for the propagation of yellow fever, when<lb/>
introduced.</p>
<p>At times, doubtless, the two diseases coexist. If this is recognized,<lb/>
light cases of yellow fever will be reported as dengue, and, even if there<lb/>
be no dengue, a community being usually extremely loath to admit yel-<lb/>
low fever, the light cases of yellow fever, and even the others, in the first<lb/>
stage of the disease, may be diagnosticated dengue, which will &ldquo;turn<lb/>
into yellow fever&rdquo; as deaths become common--a few deaths would be<lb/>
explained away.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Malarial fever</hi></p>
<p>Host-borne, by the <hi rend="italic">Anopheles</hi> mosquito, prevalent in hot climates,<lb/>
and with some of its manifestations very like yellow fever, it would be a<lb/>
wonder if malaria were not confounded with yellow fever. Also, since<lb/>
malaria was well known in Europe, the tendency would be to consider<lb/>
yellow fever malaria rather than the reverse. This was done; and it was<lb/>
not until well into the nineteenth century that we find the two diseases<lb/>
generally recognized as distinct in nature, the older view being that<lb/>
yellow fever was merely an intense form of paludism.</p>
<p>William Fergusson (1823, pp. 294-295), Inspector General of Army<lb/>
Hospitals, groups as one the famous Walcheren fever in Zealand that<lb/>
crippled the Earl of Chatham's army, and that which he had seen on the<lb/>
tablelands of Barbados in the West Indies. He sums up: &ldquo;the inten-<lb/>
sity&rdquo; of the paludal fevers produced &ldquo;from the common ague of the fens of<lb/>
Lincolnshire up to the aggravated yellow fever or malignant Remittent<lb/>
of the West Indies, may be measured almost to a certainty by the solar<lb/>
heat of the countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chisholm (1801), on the other hand, made no mistake in his pathology<lb/>
when he pronounced the &ldquo;Fever of Bulam&rdquo; which he observed in 1793 as<lb/>
distinct from the fevers hitherto prevailing in Grenada and the adjacent<lb/>
Windward Islands. He did err in his nosology when he called the latter<lb/>
&ldquo;the yellow fever of the West Indies.&rdquo; Yellow fever <hi rend="italic">had</hi> existed in<lb/>
these islands, certainly in the latter part of the seventeenth century, from<lb/>
the so-called &ldquo;epidemic of the <hi rend="italic">Oriflamme</hi>&rdquo;--the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>.&rdquo; It<lb/>
had been confounded with the paludal fevers, and the severer cases of<lb/>
<pb n="67" id="Cb000081"/>
DISEASES CONFUSED WITH YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
67<lb/>
these were called by its name. It had evidently disappeared entirely<lb/>
from these islands, and only the malarial fevers were left, to which, how-<lb/>
ever, the name &ldquo;yellow fever&rdquo; was applied. So long had it been absent<lb/>
that, on this reintroduction from Africa, it was absolutely unknown to<lb/>
local physicians, and its ravages in the generally susceptible population,<lb/>
grown up since its last prevalence, fully justified Chisholm's quotation:<lb/>
(1801, vol. i, p. 121) &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">nova pestis adest: cut nec virtute resisti, nec telis<lb/>
armisve potest</hi>&rdquo; (Ovid).</p>
<p>The point is that the malarial fevers of the Windward Islands--possi-<lb/>
bly only the severer cases of them--were then called &ldquo;yellow fever&rdquo; by<lb/>
both physicians and laity, even when no yellow fever was present, and<lb/>
when both malarial fever and yellow fever prevailed endemically they<lb/>
were considered identical, differing, if at all, only in intensity.</p>
<p>The opinion of Fergusson (1823) as to the identity of malarial and yel-<lb/>
low fever, received the powerful official endorsement of the board which,<lb/>
in 1852, formulated the so famous, or infamous, &ldquo;Second Report on<lb/>
Quarantine. Yellow Fever&rdquo; (Gt. Britain: General Board of Health,<lb/>
1852). This board was apparently called for the purpose of pronouncing<lb/>
that yellow fever was not communicable from man to man or from ship<lb/>
to shore, and simply declined to consider any evidence to the contrary.<lb/>
The report, indeed, is simply an <hi rend="italic">ex-parte</hi> argument against the communi-<lb/>
cability of yellow fever anywhere and under any circumstances. This<lb/>
decision was reached despite the powerful opposition of Sir William<lb/>
Pym (1848), Inspector General of Naval Hospitals and Superintendent<lb/>
General of Quarantine, who knew more of the nature and epidemiology<lb/>
of yellow fever than any other man in Europe of his time, and against<lb/>
the definitely and logically sustained conclusions of the French Com-<lb/>
missions, which had studied the great Spanish epidemics. Pym's argu-<lb/>
ments, with the array of admitted facts on which they were based, should<lb/>
have convinced St. Thomas himself, as should Audouard's (1822, 1824),<lb/>
but did not influence the decision of men who were determined to allow<lb/>
no maritime quarantine against yellow fever. From this time on, in<lb/>
British Africa especially, these two fevers were <hi rend="italic">officially</hi> identical and<lb/>
were officially non-communicable, and, doubtless, a certain number<lb/>
of deaths were caused by this ruling--especially in vessels on the<lb/>
African stations.</p>
<p>While this was true of the leaders of the medical profession in Europe,<lb/>
few of whom, until the Spanish epidemic of 1820, had much chance to<lb/>
study yellow fever at first hand, a number of men in America, early<lb/>
brought into intimate relation with yellow fever, saw in it, as did Chis-<lb/>
holm and Pym, a disease different in kind from malarial fever.</p>
<pb n="68" id="Cb000082"/>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>The early Spanish accounts ascribe all their epidemics to the same<lb/>
conditions of excessive heat and moisture as they associate with paludism,<lb/>
adding privation, hardship, and the sinfulness of the colonists as being<lb/>
contributory. As buboes were always included among the manifesta-<lb/>
tions of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la peste</hi>,&rdquo; the latter was doubtless, to an extent, causal.<hi rend="superscript">14</hi></p>
<p>The same is true of the causes of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; as given by P&egrave;re<lb/>
du Tertre (1667-71) and by Breton (1665) (whom the former copies),<lb/>
yet du Tertre speaks years later of intermittent fevers, tertian and<lb/>
quotidian, as existing in Guadeloupe; and Breton, (1665, p. 464) in<lb/>
his Dictionary, gives a Carib word--&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">t&iacute;o&uuml;aonoch&eacute;arou</hi>&rdquo; as equivalent<lb/>
to &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la fi&egrave;vre est intermittante</hi>.&rdquo; These French ecclesiastics, then, certainly<lb/>
from 1648, when &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la peste</hi>&rdquo; appeared in Guadeloupe, recognized yellow<lb/>
fever as distinct from paludism, and this view continued in the French<lb/>
Antilles. So in Barbados, Gamble (quoted by Hughes, 1750, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> epi-<lb/>
demic of 1691), Towne (1726), Warren (1740)--who thought it was the<lb/>
Levantine plague--Hughes (1750), and Hillary (1759), ordinary practi-<lb/>
tioners or laymen, all recognized their epidemics as different from plaudic<lb/>
fevers, as I judge, did many naval surgeons whose vessels were infected<lb/>
at Bridgetown. This was natural at Barbados, there being, I presume,<lb/>
no malaria on the island then, as there is none now. Indeed, the absence<lb/>
of paludic fevers of local origin is asserted by several of the writers<lb/>
above quoted.</p>
<p>In most places in which yellow fever occurred in America, however,<lb/>
malaria was prevalent, and in many of them, severe. It happened, then,<lb/>
that the diseases were not differentiated, except in sharp epidemics, and<lb/>
not always then. It is true that, taught by the Philadilphia epidemics,<lb/>
the celebrated La Roche (1855) regarded the diseases as distinct;<hi rend="superscript">15</hi> yet<lb/>
we find Nott in Mobile (1847) and Faget, of New Orleans, as late as<lb/>
1875, still under the necessity of <hi rend="italic">arguing</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">specificity</hi> of yellow fever.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">14</hi> Oviedo is the only one of the early chroniclers who recognized syphilis as a<lb/>
specific entity, and understood how it was contracted. He was a soldier; and the<lb/>
others, except Bernal Diaz, were ecclesiastics.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">15</hi> La Roche believed in the spontaneous origin of both yellow fever and malaria<lb/>
from heat and the decomposition of organic matters--the first mainly from animal,<lb/>
the second from vegetable sources--and that neither was communicable from man<lb/>
to man. His contemporary and rival, Benjamin Rush (1796, 1799, 1803, and 1805)<lb/>
believed them the same disease (indeed he held the doctrine of the &ldquo;unity of<lb/>
disease&rdquo;) in their spontaneous origin, as above, and, until his later years, believed<lb/>
in the communicability (&ldquo;contagion&rdquo;) of both. Later, he became a non-contag-<lb/>
ionist and was exceedingly vehement in this view, as he had been in the opposite<lb/>
one.</p>

<p>The former evidently considers himself as being distinctly on the minor-<lb/>
ity side when he argues against its being caused by a gaseous miasm--<lb/>
&ldquo;the commonly accepted cause of the paludal fevers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer, however, is inclined to think that malaria did not exist in<lb/>
America prior to its discovery. It would of necessity have been intro-<lb/>
duced early by the Europeans and negroes, and, <hi rend="italic">Anopheles</hi> being gener-<lb/>
ally present, it would have spread. Still, this spread was not immediate<lb/>
or universal, and the absence of malaria in some places must have made<lb/>
the strange disease--&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">cont&aacute;gio</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">fi&egrave;vre pestilentielle</hi>,&rdquo; or even<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la enfermedad</hi>&rdquo;--more easily recognized as peculiar to the country.</p>
<p>On the other hand, about Senegal and the Gulf of Guinea, the regions<lb/>
in which we first suspect and first definitely find yellow fever in Africa,<lb/>
malaria was very prevalent and very severe when the country was<lb/>
first visited by Europeans. Indeed, it is generally held that malaria<lb/>
was indigenous to Africa, though not necessarily to this part of it.<lb/>
Moreover, until about the middle of the eighteenth century, Europeans,<lb/>
who alone would show it, were not numerous enough at any place on this<lb/>
coast to make an epidemic of yellow fever distinguishable from those due<lb/>
to malarial fevers. Differentiation of these diseases, then, would be<lb/>
made less readily--and hence later--in Africa than in America; and in<lb/>
point of fact, the differentiation in Africa was not accepted until after,<lb/>
and doubtless on account of, their recognition as different diseases in<lb/>
America.</p>
<p>The first recognition of yellow fever in Africa, as distinct from malarial<lb/>
fever, was by Schotte (1782) in the severe epidemic among British troops<lb/>
at St. Louis de Senegal in 1778.<hi rend="superscript">16</hi> He called it &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Synochus atrabiliosa</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
and differentiated it clinically from the malarial fevers that he knew, but<lb/>
seems not to have considered it different from them in origin. Moreau<lb/>
de Jonn&egrave;s (1822), from the histories given, recognized &ldquo;the yellow fever<lb/>
of the Antilles&rdquo; as occurring in the ill-fated expedition of Captain<lb/>
Tuckey to discover the source of the Zaire (Congo) in 1816, and dis-<lb/>
cussed the question whether it was produced spontaneously where found<lb/>
or brought from America by slavers. He recognized it as frankly com-<lb/>
municable.</p>
<p>William Fergusson (1839) made the same differentiation from his</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">16</hi> B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud (1890, p. 27) is of the opinion that there may have been<lb/>
yellow fever aboard ships in the Bight of Benin as early as 1520, and in several<lb/>
expeditions into this region, from 1553 to 1588. Some of these outbreaks were<lb/>
quite certainly malarial fever, but this will be discussed later. (See Part III,<lb/>
Chapter XV.)</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>own observations on the west coast of Africa, and is as definite as to the<lb/>
communicability of yellow fever as is Moreau de Jonn&egrave;s or Pym.<lb/>
Nevertheless, that malarial fever and yellow fever were identical, differ-<lb/>
ing only in degree, and not communicable in any way, directly or in-<lb/>
directly, from the well to the sick, was made as the official decision in<lb/>
1852 and was quite generally accepted in British West Africa for some<lb/>
time later.</p>
<p>Pym (1848) used the terms &ldquo;Fever of Bulam,&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Vomito Negro</hi> Fever,&rdquo;<lb/>
reserving the name &ldquo;yellow fever&rdquo; for <hi rend="italic">malaria</hi> of a severe type, as did<lb/>
Chisholm (1801). Ferguson, in 1839, used the term &ldquo;yellow fever&rdquo; in<lb/>
the same sense we do now.</p>
<p>Even after the two diseases were differentiated, the tendency, wher-<lb/>
ever yellow fever was known, was to consider all severe, general, and<lb/>
fatal epidemics as &ldquo;yellow fever&rdquo; and the less severe ones paludism. In<lb/>
the United States, isolated severe cases, whether of malaria or of yellow<lb/>
fever, were usually reported as &ldquo;sporadic cases&rdquo; of &rdquo;yellow fever,&rdquo; and<lb/>
interpreted as showing a tendency of the &ldquo;atmosphere,&rdquo; or sometimes<lb/>
more conservatively &ldquo;of diseases,&rdquo; &ldquo;to take on a malignant aspect,&rdquo;<lb/>
which, if the cases happened to be yellow fever, and occurred in the early<lb/>
part of the summer, was not infrequently verified. This was not com-<lb/>
mon in Europe. The great epidemic of malaria in the Earl of Chatham's<lb/>
army at Walcheren, in Zealand, was, indeed, called &ldquo;yellow fever&rdquo; by<lb/>
Fergusson (1823) and, in the famous Second Report of Quarantine (Gt.<lb/>
Britain: Gen'1 Board of Health, 1852). Also, Sir William Burnett<lb/>
(1814, p. 257) gave the same name to the malarial fevers of the Mediter-<lb/>
ranean Islands. Besides these, I know of no others.<hi rend="superscript">17</hi></p>
<p>In some regions, however, and notably in the United States, quite a<lb/>
number of outbreaks of severe malaria, especially of blackwater fever,<lb/>
have been reported as yellow fever. That mentioned by Daniel Drake<lb/>
(1850, p. 134), at Memphis, in 1828, must have been one of these, as yel-<lb/>
low fever failed to propagate itself here, even in 1853. The writer has<lb/>
personally investigated a number of such. He has, however, rarely seen<lb/>
yellow fever called malaria in the United States. It is more apt to<lb/>
masquerade as dengue. In Africa, on the contrary, the tendency has</p>

Larrey (1803, p. 104), Desgenettes (1802), and Pugnet (1804) among the French<lb/>
around St. Jean d'Acre and at Damietta about the same time (1798-1799) was<lb/>
probably, some of it, plague, some malaria, and some of it hospital gangrene.</p>

as malarial fever. Of this, I think, there can be no doubt.</p>
<p>DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN YELLOW FEVER AND MALARIA</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">I. In epidemiology</hi></p>
<p>A. <hi rend="italic">General</hi>.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) Yellow fever is essentially a disease of towns and<lb/>
cities; malaria as essentially rural, or at most suburban. For instance,<lb/>
it seems scarcely reasonable to consider the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>,&rdquo; so destructive to<lb/>
the Guanches of Teneriffe in 1494, as yellow fever. The Guanches were<lb/>
distinctly a rural people, while the Spaniards, living together in a forti-<lb/>
fied camp and seaport, were not attacked.</item>
<item>(2) Yellow fever is contracted aboard ship, off-shore and on the high<lb/>
seas, and is conveyed from ship to ship and from ship to shore. Malaria<lb/>
is not contracted aboard ship, unless the vessel is lying, or has very<lb/>
recently lain, close inshore. It may, however, be contracted elsewhere<lb/>
and develop aboard ship, even some time after leaving land, under<lb/>
conditions which may lead one to mistake its source. It is not conveyed<lb/>
as an infection from ship to ship off-shore, because active <hi rend="italic">Anopheles</hi><lb/>
mosquitoes, unless confined in some close compartment, as the hold,<lb/>
would not remain aboard ship more than 36 to 48, possibly 60, hours.<hi rend="superscript">18</hi></item>
<item>(3) Yellow fever is contracted in some places on land known to be<lb/>
free from malaria--as Barbados, Ascension Island, Paita, etc.</item>
<item>(4) The duration of an epidemic, or even the infection, of yellow<lb/>
fever at any place is limited <hi rend="italic">unless new human material be supplied</hi>, and<lb/>
this independently of climatic conditions. Malaria lasts, or recurs,<lb/>
year after year, unless the conditions of <hi rend="italic">Anopheles</hi> production, or pro-<lb/>
tection from them, are changed. Yellow fever at Cadiz, severe the<lb/>
first year, lasted only two years, 1730 and 1731, (Villalba, 1803, vol. ii),<lb/>
while the epidemics of tertian, at and about Cartagena, are noted from</item>
<item><hi rend="superscript">18</hi> The writer has seen vessels--and many vessels--with malarial fever con-<lb/>
tracted at Colon, come into the Gulf Quarantine Station: &ldquo;No one on the sick list<lb/>
until ---- days out,&rdquo; &ldquo;when a cold wind coming up,&rdquo; or &ldquo;all hands wet in a<lb/>
cold squall, ---- men went down with fever.&rdquo; In one case (the German bark<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Jacobine</hi>) the days out were 10 and the number of men sickening within a few days<lb/>
were 15-all there were aboard--with 4 deaths before arrival. Two of the dead<lb/>
men (autopsied) and the ill living ones certainly had malarial fever. In the<lb/>
American bark <hi rend="italic">Zingara</hi>, from Lagos, no one was sick until over three weeks out,<lb/>
yet all came into the Marine Hospital at Chelsea (Boston) with malaria, except<lb/>
the negro cook and the master. The latter went home sick and, my recollection<lb/>
is, died.</item>

There are hundreds of such instances; and this is a reliable index of<lb/>
which disease prevails <hi rend="italic">if they prevail separately</hi>.</item>
</list></p>
<p>B. <hi rend="italic">Incidence and mortality</hi>.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) Old residents show immunity to<lb/>
yellow fever in places where it has been of frequent and recent occurrence.</item>
<item>(2) Recurrent attacks, common in malaria, are of extreme rarity in<lb/>
yellow fever.</item>
<item>(3) The death rate among those attacked is high in yellow fever.<lb/>
Malaria is usually far less fatal, to whites at any rate, yet some forms of<lb/>
it are fatal enough. It would be more correct to say that its <hi rend="italic">case<lb/>
mortality</hi> is much less than that of yellow fever. The <hi rend="italic">community<lb/>
mortality</hi> of men continuously exposed to severe malaria, from <hi rend="italic">repeated<lb/>
attacks</hi>, may show a high ratio to the population. This was especially<lb/>
true before quinine was in general use. The element of time is impor-<lb/>
tant here--a high community death rate in a <hi rend="italic">short</hi> time would point to<lb/>
yellow fever; in a longer period it need not.<hi rend="superscript">19</hi></item>
<item>(4) Death rates from yellow fever among negroes are markedly lower<lb/>
than among whites, or, so far as we know, any other race. Malaria also<lb/>
is less severe and its death rates are less in negroes than in whites, but the<lb/>
difference is very much greater in the case of yellow fever than with<lb/>
malaria. In pure-blooded negroes, yellow fever is of low mortality,<lb/>
almost a non-fatal disease. An epidemic, then, with a high mortality<lb/>
among negroes is little apt to be yellow fever.<hi rend="superscript">20</hi> If both races are in-<lb/>
volved, the white <hi rend="superscript">case fatality</hi> should be higher for both yellow fever and<lb/>
malaria, but the <hi rend="superscript">ratio of difference</hi> should be markedly higher for yellow</item>
<item><hi rend="superscript">19</hi> How great a death rate malaria can cause in a non-European population long<lb/>
free from it may be seen from the epidemic in Mauritius in 1867 and 1868. In Port<lb/>
Louis, out of 80,000 people, 22,231 died in 13 months, 234 in a single day, 31,920<lb/>
on the island (Balfour, 1920-21). This, except for the length of the epidemic,<lb/>
reads like yellow fever. A large town was severely stricken, and the use of quinine<lb/>
was well known at that time. Moreover, we are told (Fowler, 1908) that the<lb/>
variety of soil &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">which is most common</hi>&rdquo; (italics mine) &ldquo;is porous and allows water<lb/>
to drain rapidly through it. It contains few springs. This is a healthy&rdquo; (not<lb/>
malarious) &ldquo;soil.&rdquo; Balfour &ldquo;firmly believes&rdquo; that &ldquo;if Mauritius had not pos-<lb/>
sessed in many parts so porous a soil and been blessed with such a remarkable<lb/>
winter climate&rdquo;--warm weather is not continuous here--&ldquo;it might easily have<lb/>
been ruined, as was ancient Greece, and as were large tracts of ancient Italy and<lb/>
Spain.&rdquo; One cannot but agree with him.</item>
<item><hi rend="superscript">20</hi> An epidemic with a decidedly <hi rend="italic">higher</hi> mortality among blacks than whites is<lb/>
apt to be smallpox, influenza, pneumonia, plague, or certain spirochetal infections<lb/>
--as recently occurred in Senegal (Noc and Nogue, 1921). Whooping cough, too,<lb/>
is very fatal among negroes under five years of age.</item>

<item>fever. This might not always be true if the negroes, from long residence<lb/>
in a malarious locality, had acquired a great deal of immunity to the local<lb/>
disease, and the whites were newcomers. A smaller case incidence<lb/>
would also have been <hi rend="italic">reported</hi> among the blacks. Probably the case<lb/>
incidence is smaller, but certainly light cases are not recognized among<lb/>
them.</item>
<item>(5) In yellow fever the death rate among children is lower than<lb/>
among adults. The reverse is true of malaria, and the difference for<lb/>
both is greater in young children. The difference here is, however, less<lb/>
than that between the black and white races.</item>
</list></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">II. In symptomatology</hi></p>
<p>Features characteristic of yellow fever and likely to have been noted<lb/>
by the older historians, are:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) Sudden attack of a man in full health, with severe pains.</item>
<item>(2) Short duration of attack--to either death or recovery. Death<lb/>
usually comes quicker with yellow fever than with malaria, the great<lb/>
majority of yellow fever deaths being on the sixth and seventh days and<lb/>
many on the fifth. Yet the deaths that occur <hi rend="italic">within 12 to 24 hours</hi> of<lb/>
the seizure are nearly all due to malaria. I say &ldquo;nearly all,&rdquo; for fulmi-<lb/>
nating cases of yellow fever--&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">el acc&eacute;so pernicioso</hi>&rdquo;--do occur; a number<lb/>
in some epidemics. Far more commonly &ldquo;walking cases,&rdquo; sick for some<lb/>
days and dying suddenly, are reported as fulminating cases. Both<lb/>
together, in my observation, are rare compared with the deaths due<lb/>
to the fulminant forms of malaria.<hi rend="italic">21</hi></item>
<item>(3) Death frequently in convulsions--and often in coma.</item>
<item>(4) Persistent vomiting, black vomit, hemorrhages from about the<lb/>
mouth, and yellowness of the eyes and skin during the attack and in<lb/>
convalescence.<hi rend="superscript">22</hi></item>
<item><hi rend="superscript">21</hi> Good old P&egrave;re Labat (1722, vol. i, p. 73), with the optimism of one immune by<lb/>
attack--and doubtless partly to make up for the rather horrific picture he had<lb/>
drawn of it--speaks this good word for &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">le mal de Siam</hi>&rdquo;: &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Ce que cette maladie<lb/>
avoit de commode, c'est qu'elle emportoit les gens en fort pen de temps, six ou sept<lb/>
jours tout au plus terminoient l' affaire</hi>.&rdquo;</item>
<item><hi rend="superscript">22</hi> The effect of treatment at times must have profoundly influenced the sympto-<lb/>
matology of both yellow fever and malaria, and their death rates as well. Where<lb/>
antimony was used to any extent, vomiting was to be expected; and sufficient<lb/>
bleeding might produce temporary anemia in even a patient convalescent from<lb/>
yellow fever--that is, if he convalesced! It is fair to say, however, that tropical<lb/>
practitioners were very generally opposed to both of these agents as being, in their<lb/>
experience, injurious in fevers, spite of the &ldquo;teachings of the schools&rdquo; of the time.</item>
<pb n="74" id="Cb000088"/>
<item>74<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</item>
<item>(5) Extreme weakness in early convalescence is characteristic of yel-<lb/>
low fever, but convalescence is rapid and complete, and not marked by<lb/>
anemia. In malaria, convalescence is slow and imperfect, may be<lb/>
interrupted by recurrent attacks of the original infection, and one is apt<lb/>
to be weak and anemic for a long time. Anemia is in no wise a sequel-<lb/>
of yellow fever. Convalescents from yellow fever are frequently very<lb/>
yellow at first, but this does not last. The pasty, puffed face with, it<lb/>
may be, prolonged jaundice, follows malaria, not yellow fever. The<lb/>
Spaniards returning to Spain from Santo Domingo, whom Oviedo noted<lb/>
as &ldquo;of such a bad color,&rdquo; &ldquo;citroned and of the color of saffron or<lb/>
treacle,&rdquo; were quite certainly not in this condition as a result of yellow<lb/>
fever, for it was a voyage of some months from Hispaniola to Spain.<hi rend="superscript">23</hi></item>
</list></p>
<p>Since this passage from Oviedo is so frequently quoted (by Moreau de<lb/>
Jonn&egrave;s, Cornilliac, Finlay, and others) as evidence that &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la enfermedad</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
at Santo Domingo was yellow fever, it seems fair to give it in its entirety:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, in order to live, from no beast or animal of the number I have<lb/>
mentioned, did they abstain, because as many as they could obtain<lb/>
went to the fire and, boiled or roasted, there was not lacking to their<lb/>
necessity appetite to eat these things so inimical to health and so terrify-<lb/>
ing to sight.&rdquo; He is referring to dogs, wood rats, lizards, jutias, iguanas<lb/>
(&ldquo;a serpent with four feet&rdquo;), and &ldquo;serpents many-colored, but not poi-<lb/>
sonous,&rdquo; etc. &ldquo;From the which, and from the humidity and the fatness<lb/>
of the land, followed many illnesses grave and incurable to those who<lb/>
were left with life. And from this cause those first Spaniards who<lb/>
came here, when they returned to Spain, some of those who came in this<lb/>
search for gold, if they returned there, it was with the same color of it,<lb/>
but not with its lustre, but citroned and of the color of saffron or treacle,<lb/>
and so infirm that immediately, or shortly after they returned there<lb/>
they died on account of what they had suffered here and because the<lb/>
provisions and the bread of Spain are of stronger digestion&rdquo; (I think<lb/>
he means harder to digest) &ldquo;than these herbs and bad viands they eat<lb/>
here, and the airs more delicate and cold than those of this land. So<lb/>
that, although they returned to Castile, soon they gave an end to their<lb/>
lives, having arrived there&rdquo; (Oviedo, 1851-55, <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> i, <hi rend="italic">lib</hi>. 2, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. 50).</p>
<p>To the writer, this speaks strongly for malaria, not yellow fever.</p>
<p>In general, then, an epidemic of malaria can be distinguished from one<lb/>
of yellow fever. The first is especially marked by debility; the second<lb/>
by deaths. As we have said, however, if the exposure to malaria be</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">23</hi> The vessels on which these &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">azafranos</hi>&rdquo; returned to Spain left Isabela<lb/>
March 10 and arrived in Spain June 11 (Irving, 1892, vol. ii, p. 75).</p>
<pb n="75" id="Cb000089"/>
<p>DISEASES CONFUSED WITH YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
75</p>
<p>continued, there may be many deaths. The experience of Shafter's<lb/>
army at Santiago in 1898 illustrates the first; that of the British under<lb/>
Albermarle in 1762, the second. The rather exceptional Mauritius epi-<lb/>
demic of 1867 (Balfour, 1920-21) demonstrates the effect of continuous<lb/>
exposure to severe malaria. In the first case there was only a moderate<lb/>
death rate, but an almost complete destruction of the army as a fighting<lb/>
machine. Albermarle lost half of his force by death, but captured<lb/>
Havana. Had Shafter remained in Cuba, his mortality would have<lb/>
been increased and in time might possibly have approached that of<lb/>
Mauritius.</p>
<p>SICKNESS AND MORTALITY AMONG EARLY COLONISTS IN NEW COUNTRIES</p>
<p>There seems to be an unconscious bias among writers on the early<lb/>
history of yellow fever to ascribe to that disease all undue mortality<lb/>
among the newcomers to places in the tropics. Yet we know that high<lb/>
mortality was usual among colonists, and in expeditions to new countries<lb/>
under conditions where yellow fever could not possibly be accused.</p>
<p>The Jamestown colony, founded May 13, 1607, seems to be especially<lb/>
a case in point. Of the 105 men left at Jamestown by Newport when he<lb/>
sailed for England, June 22, &ldquo;more than fifty were in their graves&rdquo; by<lb/>
the end of September; and on his return to the colony, in January, 1608,<lb/>
he found only 38 survivors, little over one third (Fiske, 1900, vol. i, pp.<lb/>
94-99).</p>
<p>There had been no trouble with Indians (Fiske mentions only two<lb/>
men killed by them), by whom some food was supplied. It was noted<lb/>
that the colonists had &ldquo;crabs and sturgeon&rdquo; from the river, and they had<lb/>
brought chickens with them, which should have increased. Also, being<lb/>
a small number, yet large enough to defend themselves, it had been<lb/>
easier to live off a wild country than if they were a larger body. They<lb/>
were fortunate, too, in their Governor, John Smith. He was an un-<lb/>
usually able and energetic man, forceful, provident, and wise. He im-<lb/>
pressed, and had much influence with, the Indians, but he neither op-<lb/>
pressed nor offended them, nor suffered any of his company to do so.</p>
<p>Yet of hardships, unaccustomed mode of life, starvation, and &ldquo;fevers,&rdquo;<lb/>
a half died in three and a half months. Indeed, the last named factor,<lb/>
if they were malarial fevers, could not have been active more than two<lb/>
months--or at most two and a half--as paludal fevers in that region<lb/>
rarely show to any extent until well in August.</p>
<p>Nor was it only in the beginning of the colony that this high mortality<lb/>
prevailed. Many things witness to an excessive mortality among the<lb/>

newcomers, and for a long time. As late as 1671 the then governor, Sir<lb/>
William Berkeley, said that of the indentured servants, &ldquo;four out of five<lb/>
died during their seasoning period&rdquo; (Tyler, 1900, p. 66), and these were<lb/>
not &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">pauvres gens ramassez</hi>,&rdquo; as were the first settlers of St. Christophe,<lb/>
but, as Tyler says, &ldquo;self-respecting honest people, who came at their own<lb/>
expense or voluntarily entered into a term of service.&rdquo; In the same<lb/>
period, in the time of Bacon's Rebellion (1674), in the testimony to show<lb/>
that Bacon proposed &ldquo;to resist against even the King his Majesty,&rdquo;<lb/>
Colonel Goode quotes him as saying that even if soldiers come from<lb/>
England &ldquo;the Country or Clime not agreeing with their Constitutions,&rdquo;<lb/>
they being newcomers, &ldquo;great mortality will happen amongst them in<lb/>
their Seasoning, which will wear and weary them out.&rdquo; And with this<lb/>
statement of fact, however much he disapproved of the disloyalty inspir-<lb/>
ing it, Goode seemed to agree (Fiske, 1900, vol. ii, p. 72). There are<lb/>
many records to show that this belief in the greater liability to disease<lb/>
and death of newcomers as compared with the &ldquo;seasoned&rdquo; men was gen-<lb/>
eral in Virginia for a long time, it may be for seventy-five years or more,<lb/>
after the colony was established, and that it was based on fact.</p>
<p>Such conditions--at least in the first years of settlement--were not<lb/>
peculiar to Jamestown. One hundred and twenty men landed at the<lb/>
mouth of the Kennebec, August, 1607. So many died that those left<lb/>
abandoned the colony. Of the 100 who sailed in the <hi rend="italic">Mayflower</hi>, 51 died<lb/>
the first winter at Plymouth (Fiske, 1899, p. 82). At one time only<lb/>
seven men, including Elder Brewster and Miles Standish, were able to<lb/>
be about. Lane's colony, in the year spent at Pamlico, before they were<lb/>
taken off by Sir Francis Drake, lost half their number. It was worse<lb/>
with Laudonni&egrave;re's colony in Florida, which, as Fiske says (1900, vol. i,<lb/>
p. 20), suffered &ldquo;the frightful hardships that were the lot of most new-<lb/>
comers to the American wilderness,&rdquo; with the consequent mortality.<lb/>
Almost every colony established by Europeans, <hi rend="italic">brought directly from<lb/>
Europe</hi> to North America, suffered excessive sickness and mortality.<lb/>
Manhattan and Philadelphia are among the exceptions. The mortality<lb/>
among the early settlers in Australia, in modern times, was nearly as<lb/>
high as those just given.</p>
<p>Independently of yellow fever, the conditions in the European colonies<lb/>
in the wet tropics should have been less healthful than at Jamestown,<lb/>
both from climate and environment; and excessive mortality in them is<lb/>
not, of itself, presumptive evidence of yellow fever, even if it is much<lb/>
greater among the newcomers than among the &ldquo;seasoned&rdquo; men.</p>
<p>Much depends on the preparation for settlement, and more on the<lb/>

DISEASES CONFUSED WITH YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
77<lb/>
men sent out. Guadeloupe and Martinique were colonized by the<lb/>
French in 1635, in June and July respectively. The colonists for the<lb/>
former, numbering about 550, came direct from France--&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">pauvres<lb/>
engagez</hi>&rdquo; raised in Dieppe--and arrived with insufficient provisions to<lb/>
sustain them until they could establish themselves. After two months,<lb/>
the supplies brought from France being consumed, a famine--charac-<lb/>
terized as &ldquo;horrible&rdquo;--began. This, says du Tertre (vol. i, pp. 78-81),<lb/>
was followed by a heavy mortality due (1) to the famine; (2) to sickness<lb/>
--the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>,&rdquo; and (3) to the cruelty of the overseers of the work,<lb/>
who forced the colonists &ldquo;by blows and by severity to work in clearing<lb/>
the woods and in all weathers.&rdquo; To this last, indeed, he ascribes the<lb/>
greater part of the mortality--&ldquo;because the French were much en-<lb/>
feebled and were treated worse than slaves in Barbary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martinique was settled by d'Enambuc, who had been long in the<lb/>
West Indies, with 100 men-note the small number, who could therefore<lb/>
live off the country--&ldquo;old inhabitants of the island of St. Christophe,&rdquo;<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tous gens de main</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;accustomed to the climate, to the work and the<lb/>
fatigues of the country.&rdquo; They were &ldquo;Very skilful in clearing land,<lb/>
planting and cultivating provision, and very adroit in building houses.&rdquo;<lb/>
They brought with them, &ldquo;as provision and to plant, all things neces-<lb/>
sary,&rdquo; among which are mentioned manioc, yams, peas, beans, and other<lb/>
grains--probably Indian corn. It is expressly stated that the Guade-<lb/>
loupe colonists made no provision for future crops, being obliged later<lb/>
to send to St. Christophe for seed to plant, and in the meantime depend-<lb/>
ing entirely on supplies from France that never came (du Tertre, 1667,<lb/>
vol. i).</p>
<p>No special mortality was reported at Martinique until the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de<lb/>
Siam</hi>&rdquo; of 1690, and it may be claimed that the men from St. Kitts, some<lb/>
of whom were quite certainly buccaneers, were immune to yellow fever.<lb/>
Yet the fact that both they and d'Enambuc were used to tropical<lb/>
conditions and were &ldquo;men of their hands&rdquo; cannot be left out of considera-<lb/>
tion in accounting for this.</p>
<p>It is common enough, then, to have much sickness and many deaths<lb/>
in a newly planted colony, due simply to ignorance, lack of good admin-<lb/>
istration, and personnel unsuited to pioneer conditions. This should not<lb/>
continue, however, without some pathogenic reason. When, after<lb/>
some years, Plymouth had been well organized, the disproportionate<lb/>
mortality ceased. This lasted longer with Virginia, partly at least on<lb/>
account of the prevalence of malaria; yet, as the colony became self-<lb/>
supporting and prosperous, it disappeared, although &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">agues, epidemicals<lb/>
<pb n="78" id="Cb000092"/>
78<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
and fluxes</hi>&rdquo; are reported each fall. Tide-water Virginia abounding in<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Anopheles</hi> mosquitoes, and the life being essentially rural, there was an<lb/>
excessive mortality among newcomers for a considerable time. Even<lb/>
in Guadeloupe, after the famine, when things had settled down, one<lb/>
hears no more of excessive sickness until the advent of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la peste</hi>&rdquo; in<lb/>
1648; of none in Martinique until the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>&rdquo; in 1690, although<lb/>
it was visited by, and suffered from, the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; in 1648 also.<hi rend="superscript">24</hi></p>
<p>When, then, in an established colony, with a fairly settled life, one<lb/>
finds much sickness and many deaths <hi rend="italic">among newcomers only</hi>, the con-<lb/>
clusion is justifiable that this is due to some disease producing immunity<lb/>
against its own attacks. In the American and West African tropics<lb/>
that would most likely be yellow fever, although a certain immunity,<lb/>
far less complete than against yellow fever, is produced by malaria,<lb/>
almost everywhere present.</p>
<p>If there be also regularly an excessive mortality among the young<lb/>
children of the colonists, malaria is more probably the cause than yellow<lb/>
fever, especially if this occurs under rural or suburban conditions of life.<lb/>
Yellow fever, indeed, does raise the death rate of children, but not with<lb/>
the steady persistence of malaria.</p>
<p>The sickness and heavy death rate among newcomers--and the latter<lb/>
confined to them--during much of the eighteenth and early part of the<lb/>
nineteenth centuries in Jamaica, Barbados, and the French Antilles, the<lb/>
same conditions existing to the beginning of the twentieth in Havana, Rio<lb/>
de Janeiro, and Vera Cruz is, even by itself, very strong evidence of the<lb/>
presence of yellow fever in those places during the times stated. One<lb/>
must lay stress on the &ldquo;much sickness&rdquo; and the &ldquo;many deaths,&rdquo; because<lb/>
the newcomers do not know how to take care of themselves, and do not<lb/>
take care of themselves, in the tropics as do old residents. There is an<lb/>
acclimatization to environment and to climate when the changes in them<lb/>
are great--which lessens one's susceptibility to disease--as well as to<lb/>
disease by previous attack. This is seen even in new troops, as compared<lb/>
with old ones, when there is no change of climate, only of conditions of<lb/>
life.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">24</hi> P&egrave;re Bouton, writing in 1640 of Martinique, which he left that year, does not<lb/>
mention the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; or any dangerous disease on the island, although he<lb/>
gives a rather full account of those that occur: yaws, ulcers, and malaria. The<lb/>
language used seems to be intended for both islands, Martinique and Guadeloupe:<lb/>
&ldquo;It is marvelous if each one who arrives <hi rend="italic">in these islands</hi>&rdquo; (italics mine) &ldquo;has not<lb/>
four or five attacks of fever,&rdquo; which he regards as of small importance, advising to<lb/>
continue about and not pay too much attention to them.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I</head>
<head>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</head>
<pb n="81" id="Cb000095"/>
<p>In two regions only has yellow fever been known to have been per-<lb/>
manently endemic, tropical America and West Africa. It does not<lb/>
seem necessary, then, to consider any others as a possible place of origin:<lb/>
they are either (a) those in which the disease has not appeared at all or<lb/>
(b) those in which it failed to establish itself permanently when it did<lb/>
appear in them. Of the latter, it is to be noted that we have for the<lb/>
western Mediterranean countries a very long and reliable history, medi-<lb/>
cal and general, with nothing in it to show the existence of yellow fever in<lb/>
these countries in ancient times or until well after communication was<lb/>
established with both America and West Africa.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The same is true,<lb/>
only the history is longer, of the countries of the eastern Mediterranean.<lb/>
Certainly the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">orbis terrae</hi>&rdquo; of the Ancients--&ldquo;the world and they that<lb/>
dwell therein&rdquo; of the Psalter--may be exonerated. The claims of, or<lb/>
rather the charge against, the other two regions require examination.</p>
<p>There are data of two kinds on this problem: biological and historical.<lb/>
Let us take them in this order:</p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE ON PLACE OF ORIGIN OF YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. The reaction of the negro to yellow fever is, I think, just what one<lb/>
would expect to be evolved in a race for many generations subject to<lb/>
that infection. Negroes contract the disease, so far as we know, as read-<lb/>
ily as other races, but have it more mildly and rarely die of it. Thus,<lb/>
they apparently are as susceptible to the <hi rend="italic">infection</hi> as other races, but less<lb/>
susceptible to the <hi rend="italic">toxins</hi>; and this is what we would expect in the evolu-<lb/>
tion of a race long subject to yellow fever. The American Indian, on the<lb/>
contrary, has shown no immunity either to the infection or to the toxin.<lb/>
He contracts yellow fever and dies of it as readily as a white man.</item>
<item>2. Of its known vector, <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des (Stegomyia) aegypti</hi>, there is this to say:</item>
<item><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The first generally accepted epidemic of yellow fever in Europe, and I think<lb/>
the first, was the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">pestilencia</hi>&rdquo; of Cadiz in 1730, when 2,200 deaths occurred in<lb/>
September and October. This showed after the arrival of the flotilla of Pintado<lb/>
from Cartagena de las Indias (Villalba, 1803, vol. 2, p. 112-113), &ldquo;where it had lost<lb/>
many of its men with &lsquo;v&oacute;mito prieto&rsquo; &rdquo; (Ulloa, 1748, vol. 1, p. 61). At this time this<lb/>
disease was an old story in America.</item>

YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(a) This insect, as we have shown (page 24), is distributed by vessels,<lb/>
especially by the old sailing vessels, breeding aboard them en route; and<lb/>
no matter in what seaport it first existed in permanence it would ulti-<lb/>
mately be distributed from it to all others (climatic conditions allowing)<lb/>
to which vessels from the first port went. Ultimately, when the inter-<lb/>
locking commerce in vessels between the ports of the world had gone on<lb/>
long enough, this mosquito would be found in all ports in which we had<lb/>
the conditions of temperature and breeding places necessary for its<lb/>
continuous propagation and existence. Its presence now in any place<lb/>
is, then, no evidence that it originated there.</item>
<item>(b) It would seem that this species, so definitely differentiated in its<lb/>
biology as a commensal of man, and not regarded by entomologists as<lb/>
one of the older forms, developed from some similar one with less sharply<lb/>
marked characteristics, and that, in the region where this took place,<lb/>
one would be apt to find a number of forms allied to it, but less completely<lb/>
differentiated; that is, different species of the same subgenus and with<lb/>
similar, but not quite the same, life history.</item></list></item>
</list></p>
<p>Now no other species of this subgenus (<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi>) is listed as oc-<lb/>
curring in the Americas. And for this one, its occurrence in America<lb/>
as early as we believe we definitely recognize yellow fever there (1648),<lb/>
about 150 years after intimate communication between West Africa and<lb/>
tropical America by slavers, would, for the reason given above, mean<lb/>
little or nothing for its American origin, especially as we know that the<lb/>
area of its infestation in the New World has been considerably increased<lb/>
in recent historic times.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are many species of <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi> in West<lb/>
Africa and other regions of the Old World, some of them breeding with<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, and of fairly similar biology. It seems, then, to be essentially<lb/>
an Old World form, that is, to have been evolved there. That this spec-<lb/>
ies (<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>) is of Old World origin is, I think, held by most of the leading<lb/>
entomologists: by Howard, Chief of the U. S. Bureau of Entomology;<lb/>
by Dyar, and by the late Frederick Knab of the same bureau; by<lb/>
Edwards, Entomologist of the British Museum (stated by the first two<lb/>
in verbal communication, and by the last by letter (March 23,1923))<hi rend="italic">2</hi>; and,</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> I quote from a letter of Edwards, March 23, 1923: &ldquo;I entirely agree with your<lb/>
suggestion that the fact that <hi rend="italic">S. fasciata (argenteus: aegypti)</hi> has no near American<lb/>
relatives, but a number in Africa, argues rather strongly for the West African ori-<lb/>
gin of the disease, even though there might be some possibility of its having been<lb/>
introduced into the Americas in some prehistoric period, which may not be<lb/>
likely. It is indeed certain that there are several species of this subgenus in</p>
<pb n="83" id="Cb000097"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
83</p>
<p>although from other reasons than those given above, is strongly advo-<lb/>
cated by Goldi of Par&aacute; (1905, p. 104).</p>
<p>If this species originated in the Old World it does not seem reasonable<lb/>
that it should have reached America prior to the discovery of 1492,<lb/>
accompanying an early immigration of men from the Old World, since<lb/>
this immigration was most probably by land and, for a long time,<lb/>
through what must have been, even then, cold regions. If this insect<lb/>
reached America only after 1492, yellow fever could not have existed<lb/>
in America prior to that date.</p>
<p>Such biological data, then, as are given by both human and insect<lb/>
host are entirely in favor of an Old World, that is, West African, origin<lb/>
of yellow fever. Since, however, we can only say that the reaction of<lb/>
the negro race to yellow fever is what one would expect to be produced<lb/>
in a race long subject to that infection, not that it was positively pro-<lb/>
duced by that cause; and that the facts known of the vector render it<lb/>
extremely probable that this species had its origin in the Old World, not<lb/>
that it positively did originate there, the most the above biological data<lb/>
and argument can do is to produce what logicians call an &ldquo;antecedent<lb/>
probability&rdquo; of this, to the writer, of decided weight; but of its weight<lb/>
each one must judge for himself.</p>
<p>HISTORICAL EVIDENCE ON PLACE OF ORIGIN OF YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>Yellow fever was recognized as a disease <hi rend="italic">sui generis</hi> in America long<lb/>
before it was so recognized in Africa; and before this differentiation from<lb/>
other diseases we can quite certainly, I think, from the old descriptions<lb/>
of indefinitely and variously named epidemics, recognize it as being in<lb/>
America before we can claim this for Africa.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi></p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Africa which are very closely allied to the yellow fever vector, both on adult and<lb/>
larval morphology, and in their habits, although <hi rend="italic">S. fasciata</hi> is the only one which<lb/>
has developed a special association with man. These allied species all breed in<lb/>
tree-holes, leaf axils, or other such places where there are small natural collections<lb/>
of water, and it is perhaps of some significance that <hi rend="italic">S. fasciata</hi> still shows a distinct<lb/>
preference for such places so long as they are obtainable within the near neighbor-<lb/>
hood of human settlements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is also another matter which seems to me to point in the same direction,<lb/>
that is the distribution of <hi rend="italic">S. fasciata</hi> in Africa. On that continent it is extremely<lb/>
widespread, being found far into the interior in almost every village. I believe I<lb/>
am correct in saying that in America, and also in the Oriental and Australasian<lb/>
regions, it is more abundant in seaports, outside which it has a very limited dis-<lb/>
tribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> The first account of a sickness that can definitely and with certainty be recog-<lb/>
nized in the New World as yellow fever is, I think, that of 1648 in Guadeloupe and</p>
<pb n="84" id="Cb000098"/>
<p>84<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these statements are less convincing as to the American<lb/>
origin of yellow fever than one at first sight might think. These two<lb/>
regions were brought into communication with Europeans practically<lb/>
at the same time, and both before--and long before--yellow fever was<lb/>
recognized in either by Europeans. And, with two exceptions to be<lb/>
noted later, we have only European history to guide us in this matter.<lb/>
Cape Verde was rounded in 1444; the Guinea Coast, the region under<lb/>
suspicion, was visited in 1471, and the first settlement, <hi rend="italic">S&atilde;o Jorge da<lb/>
Mina</hi> (now Elmina), was made in 1482, only 11 years before Columbus<lb/>
founded Isabela.</p>
<p>Moreover, the communication between tropical America and this<lb/>
newly discovered part of Africa began early and was intimate, so that<lb/>
not only yellow fever, but its insect vector, might well have been trans-<lb/>
ferred from either one to the other many times and have been well estab-<lb/>
lished in its new home before the disease was in fact recognized in either<lb/>
country. The first general license for the slave trade to the Spanish<lb/>
Indies was not issued (by Charles V) until 1516; but Ovando, the Gover-<lb/>
nor of Hispaniola, in 1503 petitions that no more negroes be allowed to<lb/>
come in as they were already too many for good order (Herrera <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, i,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">dec.</hi> 1, <hi rend="italic">lib.</hi> 5). It is this trade which, almost from the discovery of<lb/>
America, formed an intimate bond between West Africa and Spanish<lb/>
and Portuguese--and later French and English--America. This quite<lb/>
certainly carried yellow fever backwards and forwards between them<lb/>
until each one accused the other, and with truth, of being the immediate<lb/>
source of its infection. For example, the &ldquo;fever of Bulam&rdquo; was brought<lb/>
from the West African (Guinea) Coast in 1793 to the Island of Grenada,<lb/>
whence it spread widely over the Little Antilles and the South Caribbean<lb/>
littoral, while in 1866 the <hi rend="italic">Rosa del Turia</hi>, leaving Havana, with nearly 200<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">d&eacute;port&eacute;s</hi>, carried infection to Fernando Po, where it made great ravages<lb/>
and spread to other islands in the Gulf of Guinea (Yglesias y Pardo,<lb/>
quoted by H. Rey, 1878). One might instance a number of other cross-</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>other French Antilles (du Tertre, 1667-71, vol. i, p. 422) and in Yucatan (Lopez<lb/>
de Cogolludo, 1688).</p>
<p>In Africa, although Lind's (1792) account of fever aboard vessels off the coast of<lb/>
Senegal in 1768 is usually accepted as the first in which we can definitely recognize<lb/>
yellow fever for that continent, yet we must await Schotte's report (1782) of the<lb/>
epidemic of 1778 among the British troops at St. Louis de Senegal to find anything<lb/>
approaching the certainty of the yellow fever of 1648 described by Cogolludo in<lb/>
Yucatan. The earlier, but less definite, data from the Slave Coast will be taken<lb/>
up later.</p>
<pb n="85" id="Cb000099"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
85</p>
<p>transferences, as when the frigate <hi rend="italic">Nivaria</hi> (1862) infected the Canaries<lb/>
(M&eacute;lier, 1863, p. 194) etc., etc. There are several such instances<lb/>
recorded, and doubtless others that escaped record; and even in very<lb/>
recent times Flu (1910) states that the yellow fever which was epidemic<lb/>
in Togoland when he wrote was &ldquo;imported from America, probably<lb/>
before 1896.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">4</hi></p>
<p>REGIONS FOR EXAMINATION IN AMERICA</p>
<p>Knowing the conditions necessary for the continual existence of<lb/>
yellow fever, there were but few regions in the Americas, prior to their<lb/>
discovery by Columbus, in which we would expect this to occur, that is,<lb/>
which would serve as permanent endemic foci, from which, however,<lb/>
the disease would, or might, from time to time, spread as epidemics<lb/>
elsewhere. These regions are:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. The Gulf Coast of Mexico, the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tierra caliente</hi>&rdquo; of that country.</item>
<item>2. The Maya country of Yucatan and Central America.</item>
<item>3. The coastal region of Peru, especially that of the Chimu civiliza-<lb/>
tion, centering around the present city of Trujillo.</item>
<item>4. The scattered area about the Caribbean, mainland and islands,<lb/>
linked together as a unit by the voyages of the Caribs and, to an extent,<lb/>
occupied by them.</item>
</list></p>
<p>There are no other regions save the first three at once warm enough<lb/>
for the continuous activity of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> and in which there was sufficient<lb/>
concentration of population to furnish the supply of susceptible men<lb/>
necessary to continue the infection indefinitely. There was nowhere<lb/>
any great concentration of population among the Caribs, but the move-<lb/>
ment of these seafarers from place to place would, or might, have the<lb/>
same effect in continuing infection as would the existence of a much<lb/>
larger more sedentary population.</p>
<p>If yellow fever were originally permanent in either one of the first two<lb/>
regions, the communication between them would probably be sufficient,<lb/>
in course of time, to carry it to the other, where it would prevail, in epi-<lb/>
demic form at first, to become permanently endemic, or not, according to<lb/>
the sociological conditions that existed there. If originally only <hi rend="italic">long<lb/>
continuing</hi>--as compared with <hi rend="italic">permanent--in</hi> any one, it might be carried<lb/>
from time to time to others and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, so that they together might</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> No reference is given for this statement, and the writer has no knowledge of<lb/>
its basis. Flu, however, is an extremely careful and reliable man and a trained<lb/>
epidemiologist, and the writer is inclined to accept his statement as he gives it.</p>

form a permanent regional focus, although this might be true of neither<lb/>
one separately.</p>
<p>The Peruvian area may be eliminated at once. It was absolutely<lb/>
isolated from any other concentration of population in regions warm<lb/>
enough for continuous <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> activity, and in this region, the history of<lb/>
which is quite well known, no epidemic of any kind is recorded either<lb/>
among the natives or the Spaniards until well after the Conquest, when<lb/>
European diseases--smallpox and typhus--wrought havoc among the<lb/>
natives.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Of the Carib region</hi> there is this to say: that in this area, after settle-<lb/>
ment of Europeans, when susceptible immigration, population, and<lb/>
intercommunication were all greater than in pre-Columbian days, yellow<lb/>
fever did not maintain itself continuously, but died out more than once.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi><lb/>
It seems unreasonable, then, to think that this Carib area could have<lb/>
remained, by itself, a permanent focus. However, by occasional com-<lb/>
munications with the other regional foci just mentioned, it might have<lb/>
been the seat of scattered, and hence long continued, epidemics, and<lb/>
thus have assisted in maintaining that focus, forming a part of it in-<lb/>
deed.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> There seems, however, to have been very little, if any, contact<lb/>
between these seafarers and either the Mexicans or Mayas.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> The &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; of 1648 in the Little Antilles raged as an <hi rend="italic">epidemic</hi>, and hence was<lb/>
a new introduction. The same is true of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>&rdquo; in 1690 and of the<lb/>
Bulam Fever of 1793.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">6</hi> Even Dr. Carlos Finlay (<hi rend="italic">nomen clarum et venerabile!</hi>), who was a most earnest<lb/>
advocate of the American origin of yellow fever, is inclined to confine its perman-<lb/>
ent endemicity, before 1495, to the mainland. Among his &ldquo;conclusions&rdquo; are<lb/>
(Finlay, 1912, p. 125):</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>&ldquo;(1) Before the discovery of America by the Spaniards yellow fever was en-<lb/>
demic in the coasts of the Sea of the North of New Spain&rdquo; (Mexico) &ldquo;(Vera Cruz<lb/>
in particular) and in the <hi rend="italic">Tierra-firme</hi> (Darien: Nombre de Dios) . . . .</item>
<item>&ldquo;(2) The Carib Indians of the Islands, in consequence of their frequent excur-<lb/>
sions to the coasts of the <hi rend="italic">Tierra-firme</hi> . . . . must have collected the germs of the<lb/>
pestilence which they would bring to their respective islands (the Little Antilles)<lb/>
so as to occasion new epidemics whenever they met individuals there in a state to<lb/>
contract the sickness.</item>
<item>&ldquo;(3) The Island of Santo Domingo, except perhaps the Province of Higuey,<lb/>
which the Caribs were accustomed to visit, probably had not been invaded by the<lb/>
pestilence until 1495, the Admiral having been infected the previous year, 1494,<lb/>
on the coasts of Higuey.</item>
<item>&ldquo;(4) The Isle of Cuba . . . . remained free from the invasion of yellow fever<lb/>
during the first 138 years of its settlement by the Spaniards, to 1649, in which<lb/>
year the pestilence was imported from the neighboring continent.&rdquo;</item>
</list></p>
<p>Elsewhere he states that both Porto Rico, although it was much frequented<lb/>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
89</p>
<p>Believed to be originally from the Amazon valley, the Caribs appar-<lb/>
ently had begun their war upon, and displacement of, the Arrowacks<lb/>
and Lucayans no great while before the discovery of America, and were<lb/>
extending it when the Spaniards came. They were bold navigators,<lb/>
going from the mainland up the chain of the Little Antilles to Porto Rico,<lb/>
Higuey (the south side of Santo Domingo), and Cuba. When first seen by<lb/>
the whites they occupied much, but not all, of the part of the Caribbean<lb/>
littoral of the mainland, &ldquo;from the mouth of the Essequibo River to the<lb/>
Gulf of Maracaibo,&rdquo; says Brinton (1891, p. 251). &ldquo;West of the latter&rdquo;<lb/>
they &ldquo;did not reach the coast . . . . in spite of frequent assertions to<lb/>
the contrary.&rdquo; They occupied also practically all of the Little Antilles<lb/>
which were inhabited. Some of them were not inhabited at all when<lb/>
first visited by the whites, and a number not permanently. In Porto<lb/>
Rico and Hispaniola the Caribs occupied only parts of the islands, more<lb/>
of the first than of the latter, having apparently arrived only recently.<lb/>
They were savages, living in small communities and, on the Little<lb/>
Antilles at any rate, from hand to mouth. They cultivated maize and<lb/>
cassava to some extent, but supplemented them by wild fruits, roots,<lb/>
game, fish, shell-fish, and turtles. Many, I think not all, of them used<lb/>
poisoned arrows and were cannibals--indeed gave us this name.<hi rend="superscript">8</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> If the part of Hispaniola (Hayti) occupied by the Lucayans contained<lb/>
1,000,000 inhabitants, as asserted by Oviedo (1851-55, vol. 1, p. 71) this island,<lb/>
if not large enough to be added to the list of possible permanent foci, could have<lb/>
been an important factor in continuing the duration of the infection in the Carib<lb/>
area. One has, however, a general idea that the number of Indians defeated in<lb/>
battle or dying is exaggerated in these early accounts.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">8</hi> The San Bias Indians, Brinton states, are not Caribs, but Cunas, which family<lb/>
extended from the Gulf of Uraba to the Chagres. They may be allied to the<lb/>
Caribs, or to the Chibchas of Colombia, but their affiliations are not certain.<lb/>
They did not use poisoned arrows.</p>

<pb n="90" id="Cb000104"/>
<p>Fortunately, we have, for Mexico, unusually complete records, both for<lb/>
a considerable period before the Spanish Conquest and for the century<lb/>
following it. The records available for this time may be classified into<lb/>
three groups:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>I. The records of the Mexicans themselves, as kept before the Con-<lb/>
quest in a conventionalized picture writing, hieroglyphics, and continued<lb/>
in the same manner for some time thereafter.</item>
<item>II. Those written soon after the Conquest by the Spanish historians<lb/>
who wrote of the Mexico prior to the Conquest, from native sources of<lb/>
information. These men were, in general, familiar with the language of<lb/>
the country (Nahuatl) and in intimate relation with the natives; and<lb/>
they made full use of Mexican knowledge, both record and tradition.<lb/>
They had, too, the assistance of natives &ldquo;instructed in interpreting these<lb/>
pictures.&rdquo;</item>
<item>III. The writings of Spanish historians who wrote entirely from the<lb/>
Spanish standpoint, some from first-hand and some from second-hand<lb/>
information.</item>
</list></p>
<p>I. MEXICAN RECORDS</p>
<p>The period before the Conquest<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> is covered by the Nahuatl hiero-<lb/>
glyphic manuscripts, now known as <hi rend="italic">codices</hi>, and a number of <hi rend="italic">anales</hi>, in<lb/>
that language, but written in Roman script. The first parts of these<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">anales</hi> are evidently transcriptions from older hieroglyphics, some of<lb/>
which have been lost and some of which are attached to the <hi rend="italic">anales</hi>.<lb/>
The latter parts are narratives of contemporaries and generally of eye-<lb/>
witnesses. In many of the <hi rend="italic">codices</hi>, as we have them, along with the<lb/>
pictures are their interpretations by Mexicans &ldquo;instructed in such<lb/>
matters,&rdquo; sometimes in Nahuatl, but in Latin script, and sometimes in<lb/>
Spanish. When the former is used, there are translations, generally<lb/>
literal, into Spanish or, in some cases, French. In a few, as in the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Anales de Tecamachalco</hi>, which were not discovered, or at any rate not<lb/>
translated, early, there are Nahuatl words of which we do not know the</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> August 13 (old style), 1521, when Cortez captured the City of Mexico, is gener-<lb/>
ally accepted as its date.</p>
<p>90</p>
<pb n="91" id="Cb000105"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
91</p>
<p>meaning. These <hi rend="italic">codices</hi> or <hi rend="italic">anales</hi> cover not only the period before the<lb/>
Conquest, some from the beginning of the wanderings of the Chichemecs,<lb/>
the date of which is variously given, but continue for some time after-<lb/>
wards.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Codex Telleriano-Remensis</hi>, for instance, is brought down<lb/>
to 1562 by the copyist (the original covers to 1555), and the <hi rend="italic">Anales de<lb/>
Chimalpahin</hi> to 1612. There was less break in the general life of the<lb/>
Mexican people at the Conquest than one might suppose. The rulers<lb/>
of petty states continued to hold positions of authority under the<lb/>
Spaniards, and some of these <hi rend="italic">codices</hi> were continued through and after<lb/>
the Conquest just as they had been before.</p>
<p>The history of the Mexican people, then, for some 75 years before the<lb/>
Conquest and for 50 to 60 years thereafter, is fairly well covered by these<lb/>
Nahuatl records. Naturally, they give more space to wars, territorial<lb/>
expansion, deaths and accession of rulers than to the data we especially<lb/>
seek; yet they do record eclipses of the sun, storms, earthquakes, drouths,<lb/>
famines, years of distress and of unusual mortality from various causes,<lb/>
etc. For the period during and after the Conquest, they continue their<lb/>
record of similar things. Thus, they note years of unusual mortality--<lb/>
two due to famines, and five at least to epidemic diseases. This native<lb/>
record since the Conquest we can compare with that of contemporary<lb/>
Spanish historians and thus get an idea of the point of view of the<lb/>
Nahuatl writers so as to measure the <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> value of their records, that<lb/>
is, whether their failure to note an event means its non-occurrence, as<lb/>
well as their positive value. They measure up to this test nearly, not<lb/>
quite, so well as the Spanish writers of the first group; better than those<lb/>
of the second. These records naturally are authoritative on the customs<lb/>
of the Mexicans, on which they incidentally give much information, and<lb/>
are invaluable as a history of early Mexico. Their chronology, for the<lb/>
period named, and indeed for much longer, is reliable and has been veri-<lb/>
fied by the dates given for eclipses of the sun.</p>
<p>The earlier records are, it is true, exclusively concerned with the<lb/>
Central Plateau, the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tierra fria</hi>,&rdquo; which was the origin and seat of the<lb/>
Mexican power, yet during the seventy-five years before the Conquest,<lb/>
which we have instanced as especially well covered by these records, this<lb/>
power was in communication with, and occupying parts of, the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tierra<lb/>
caliente</hi>,&rdquo; the possible original focus of yellow fever. The <hi rend="italic">Codex Teller</hi>-</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> We have what claims to be continuous history from that period, and fairly<lb/>
good, though scant, history from the latter part of the fourteenth century. In-<lb/>
deed, the <hi rend="italic">Anales de Cuauhtitlan</hi> give an unbroken, although not a full, account<lb/>
from 635 to 1519.</p>
<pb n="92" id="Cb000106"/>
<p>92<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">iano-Remensis</hi> (pp. 38-42), for instance, gives 1458 as the year in which<lb/>
&ldquo;the Mexicans . . . . subjected to their service the Province of<lb/>
Chicoaque . . . . towards the north, which is near Panuco. This is the<lb/>
first province which they subjected.&rdquo; In 1461 &ldquo;subjected the Mexicans<lb/>
the Province of Cotlaxtla . . . . twenty leagues from Vera Cruz.&rdquo;<lb/>
This had again to be &ldquo;conquered&rdquo; in 1475. In 1502 the daughter of<lb/>
Montezuma, after she had borne children to the Lord of Tehuantepec,<lb/>
advised her husband that her father had given her in marriage to him to<lb/>
further designs on his kingdom, and &ldquo;no more Mexicans entered that<lb/>
land until the Christians came, who subjected it.&rdquo; Thus Tehuantepec,<lb/>
although not included in the Mexican realm, had been in close commun-<lb/>
ication with it. In 1513 &ldquo;the Mexicans conquer the lands of Totopec--<lb/>
80 leagues from Mexico, joined to the sea of the south&rdquo; (the Gulf of<lb/>
Mexico, south of Panuco). They had long had communication, hostile<lb/>
and commercial, with the Mayas of the low country, some with those of<lb/>
Yucatan, but more with those of Huasteca, a province on the Panuco<lb/>
River, &ldquo;as populous as any province under the sun,&rdquo; says Fray Nicolas<lb/>
de Witte, who visited it in 1543.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> The Huastecs were attacked and<lb/>
defeated several times (1460-1464) by Montezuma I, but not subjected<lb/>
(Dur&aacute;n, Diego, 1867-80, vol. i, p. 165).</p>
<p>I think we can claim, then, that if the <hi rend="italic">tierra caliente</hi> was a permanent<lb/>
focus of yellow fever there was sufficient communication with it by the<lb/>
Mexican warriors and people from the plateau for yellow fever to show<lb/>
among them when they entered this region and for it to be carried into<lb/>
other infectible places to which they afterward went, and one would ex-<lb/>
pect this to have been recorded.</p>
<p>II. SPANISH WRITERS OF THE FIRST GROUP</p>
<p>Following the Conquest (1521) we have an unusual wealth of record<lb/>
by Spanish writers: Motolinia, who came to Mexico in 1524; Sahag&uacute;n<lb/>
in 1529; Mendieta in 1554; Diego Dur&aacute;n, a Dominican, born in Mexico<lb/>
about 1538, who wrote about the middle of the sixteenth century, and<lb/>
finally, Torquemada. All were men familiar with the language. Saha-<lb/>
g&uacute;n's great work was written in Nahuatl and translated by himself into<lb/>
Spanish, leaving an occasional word untranslated, a few of which we<lb/>
cannot yet find in the Nahuatl dictionaries. All were men of education,<lb/>
thoroughly interested in, and in sympathy with, their subjects. Also,</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Letter of de Witte, an Augustinian, written 1554, quoted by Ternaux-Compans<lb/>
(1840, vol. 16, p. 286).</p>
<pb n="93" id="Cb000107"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
93</p>
<p>they were all men with the kind of authority which brought them close<lb/>
to the natives,<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> and were in a position to know of what they were writing,<lb/>
having access to many Nahuatl picture writings not now available<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> and<lb/>
to Mexicans skilled in making and reading them. All of them give the<lb/>
sociological history of the people, not only the political and military<lb/>
events. Between them they give the history of the Mexicans from well<lb/>
before the Conquest to the end of the sixteenth century, their culture<lb/>
and customs before the Conquest, and those then prevailing. Sahag&uacute;n,<lb/>
Dur&aacute;n, Mendieta, and Torquemada especially go into these learnedly<lb/>
and in much detail.</p>
<p>Torquemada was the official historian of his order, the Franciscans, for<lb/>
secular Mexico, as was Mendieta for the progress of the church therein.<lb/>
In his great work, <hi rend="italic">La Monarquia Indiana</hi>, he evidently had the assistance<lb/>
of many others, Spaniards and Mexicans. Both he and Mendieta<lb/>
acknowledge their indebtedness to Olmos, Molina (authors of the first<lb/>
Nahuatl grammar and first dictionary, respectively), Motolinia, and<lb/>
others. Torquemada also mentions Orozco, Gomara, Acosta, and<lb/>
Mendieta himself, whose pupil he was. A large part of this book is<lb/>
taken up with the history before the Conquest, evidently from the<lb/>
Nahuatl picture-writing interpreted by educated Mexicans. He goes<lb/>
at length into the customs and culture of the Mexicans before and since<lb/>
the Conquest and also gives, in much detail, the history, both social<lb/>
and political, since the Conquest.</p>
<p>I will add that it is only comparatively recently that many of these<lb/>
works have been available (save in manuscript), as they were published<lb/>
since 1880. The same is true of a number of the <hi rend="italic">codices</hi> and <hi rend="italic">anales</hi>. We</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Motolinia was one of the founders of <hi rend="italic">la Ciudad de los Angeles</hi> and held the<lb/>
royal appointment of <hi rend="italic">Guardi&aacute;n de los Indios</hi> in Huexalzinco, and was most earnest,<lb/>
and most unpopular among the Spaniards, in the exercise of this function.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> Many Nahuatl manuscripts were purposely destroyed, as being idolatrous<lb/>
pictures, in the years soon after the Conquest. Archbishop Zum&aacute;rraga is charged,<lb/>
by almost all writers on early Mexican history, with having had a great <hi rend="italic">auto-da-f&eacute;</hi><lb/>
of them--as did Bishop Landa at Mani in 1562 of the Maya manuscripts--and is<lb/>
much reprobated therefor. Garc&iacute;a Icazbalceta (1881, p. 305, 371) denies this<lb/>
most bitterly, and I believe that he is right. Certainly I can find nowhere the<lb/>
date at which any such special <hi rend="italic">auto-da-f&eacute;</hi> was held, while we do know that of<lb/>
Landa's in Yucatan. There is no question, however, that there was a general<lb/>
intentional destruction of such manuscripts soon after the Conquest, for the<lb/>
reason given above, and that men of liberal culture, like Motolinia, Olmos, Molina,<lb/>
Dur&aacute;n, and Sahag&uacute;n--the last especially--had seen and utilized many manu-<lb/>
scripts not available to even their immediate successors.</p>
<pb n="94" id="Cb000108"/>
<p>94<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>have, therefore, advantages for this research not possessed by investiga-<lb/>
tors of a generation ago.</p>
<p>III. SPANISH WRITERS OF THE SECOND GROUP</p>
<p>The histories of Gomara, the chaplain to Cortez after his return to<lb/>
Spain, who afterward accompanied the conqueror to Mexico, of Bernal<lb/>
Diaz del Castillo, of Oviedo, and of Herrera, ordinarily quoted for early<lb/>
Mexican history, are decidedly less valuable for our purpose than those<lb/>
we have mentioned. The first two are primarily histories of the Con-<lb/>
quest and give little information, even incidentally, on anything else.<lb/>
Gomara's account is intended as a eulogy of Cortez. He also was<lb/>
blessed with a vivid imagination and possibly valued the literal fact less<lb/>
than modern historians are supposed to.</p>
<p>The honest old Conquistador, Bernal Diaz del Castillo, confessedly<lb/>
wrote his book, <hi rend="italic">Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de la Nueva Espa&ntilde;a</hi>,<lb/>
to correct the many errors and faults in the book of Gomara, which he<lb/>
does in a wholehearted way. It is a wonderfully graphic account, and<lb/>
impresses one as an accurate report of the Conquest as he saw it--and<lb/>
he saw most of it--but of little else. He, I think, mentions sickness, as<lb/>
distinguished from wounds, only three times: once the epidemic of<lb/>
smallpox among the Indians in 1520, to be noted in its place; and, also<lb/>
to be noted in their places, that eight soldiers had died, apparently of<lb/>
pneumonia, at Saltocan the same year; and the deaths of three persons<lb/>
of note, possibly in a small epidemic of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la modorra</hi>,&rdquo; in Mexico City, in<lb/>
1526. It is extremely well written, in spite of an absolute disregard of<lb/>
punctuation, spelling, and capitals--never once does he allow his leader<lb/>
a capital C!</p>
<p>Herrera was the official historiographer of Philip II and his successors,<lb/>
and his account was compiled from the reports of others. We probably<lb/>
now have more, and quite certainly more accurate, data than he had.</p>
<p>Much that Oviedo wrote was also from the reports of others, but he<lb/>
was much closer to his subject than was Herrera. He came to America,<lb/>
a young man, in 1514, and knew and talked with the men who had taken<lb/>
part in the things of which he wrote. His profession, that of a soldier,<lb/>
his official position as a <hi rend="italic">Veedor</hi> (inspector) <hi rend="italic">del Rey</hi> with the expedition of<lb/>
Pedrarias Davila to Darien, and his long residence in America should<lb/>
have given him a decidedly better knowledge of American affairs than<lb/>
seems possible to the official historiographer. He impresses one as being<lb/>
a far more acute man than Herrera, evaluating his data, not accepting<lb/>
them blindly. He is generally, and we think rightly, considered more<lb/>
<pb n="95" id="Cb000109"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
95<lb/>
reliable than the latter. The first edition of his <hi rend="italic">Historia General y Nat-<lb/>
ural de las Indias</hi>, published in 1535, was the first systematic account<lb/>
of the New World to be published.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">6</hi> Oviedo has a certain sense of humor. After deprecating the idea, which he<lb/>
feared some of his readers might entertain, that an Indian &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">naborio</hi>&rdquo; was in any<lb/>
sense a slave, since both a decree of the Emperor and a rescription of the Council<lb/>
(of the Indies) specifically denied this, he reluctantly admits that a &ldquo; &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">naborio</hi>&rsquo;<lb/>
is an Indian who has to work whether he wants to or not.&rdquo; I do not think that<lb/>
the official historiographer ever would have looked beyond the decree of the<lb/>
Emperor.</p>

<p>The foregoing lengthy discussion of our sources of information seems<lb/>
necessary in order that we may estimate the value of their information,<lb/>
especially the value of their <hi rend="italic">negation</hi> of information. Neither for the<lb/>
period before the Conquest nor thereafter, up to and including 1576--<lb/>
for which time we have very complete data--is there, in either the Nah-<lb/>
uatl records or in those of the first group of Spanish historians, an ac-<lb/>
count of any sickness which can possibly be considered as yellow fever.<lb/>
There is a passage in Bernal Diaz which has been instanced, and an<lb/>
often-quoted one of Herrera which is held to imply the existence of this,<lb/>
or some similar, disease on the Mexican littoral about and to the north of<lb/>
Vera Cruz. They will be discussed later.</p>
<p>SICKNESS AND MORTALITY BEFORE THE CONQUEST</p>
<p>Before the Conquest, some years of unusual mortality (as 1447, 1452,<lb/>
1453, 1454, and 1506) are noted. In every instance the cause is given as<lb/>
either cold or famine, and this famine <hi rend="italic">preceding</hi> the mortality. In every<lb/>
instance, too, a sufficient cause is given for the famine: grasshoppers in<lb/>
1446; drouth in 1504 and 1505; or unusual cold, with hail or snow,<lb/>
destroying the crops. This statement of cause is the more convincing<lb/>
when we consider that these records were made year by year as the years<lb/>
passed, and were not retrospective. And in every instance the mortality<lb/>
is recorded as occurring in the <hi rend="italic">tierra fria</hi> where, often introduced, yellow<lb/>
fever has never been known to spread, it being too cold either for suffi-<lb/>
cient <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> activity or for the development of the causative organism<lb/>
in the insect. Whatever the cause, the historical proof of this region's<lb/>
being &ldquo;uninfectible&rdquo; by yellow fever in historical times, is complete. It<lb/>
may be noted, too, that, save the last, all of these instances of unusual<lb/>
mortality occurred before the arms of the Mexicans were carried into<lb/>
the coastal regions about Vera Cruz or Panuco. After that, about 1458,<lb/>
we hear of no special epidemic for some fifty years. This is contrary<lb/>
to what one would expect had this <hi rend="italic">tierra caliente</hi> been a permanent en<lb/>
demic focus of yellow fever at this time.</p>
<p>There is, in this period, one year of very great mortality, 1454, which<lb/>
deserves special mention, as the Nahuatl picture accompanying that<lb/>

<pb n="97" id="Cb000111"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
97<lb/>
year has been interpreted as showing an epidemic of yellow fever. This<lb/>
picture, in the <hi rend="italic">Codex Telleriano-Remensis</hi> (f. 38), represents three<lb/>
figures, two men and a woman, one man and the woman vomiting,<lb/>
and all apparently dying. The material around them, apparently<lb/>
vomited, resembles worms or snakes and is of the same brown tint as<lb/>
the men, but delineated by black dots, instead of continuous black lines<lb/>
as the figures themselves are. The Spanish text interpreting this pic-<lb/>
ture, by &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Preste Juan de las Yndias</hi>,&rdquo; who &ldquo;found the jewels&rdquo; (this</p>

<p>Codex) &ldquo;in the year 5 Rabbit,&rdquo; i.e., 1562, is: &ldquo;Year 1 Rabbit, and of<lb/>
1454 according to ours, there was so great hunger that men died of the<lb/>
hunger.&rdquo; This picture, however, shows sickness, and sickness of which<lb/> 
vomiting, possibly with occasional worms (<hi rend="italic">ascarides</hi>), was a prominent<lb/>
feature. There is no evidence anywhere of blood, which, in this Codex,<lb/>
both before and after this picture, is always represented with well<lb/>
marked splotches of red. The action of the picture was on the highlands<lb/>
of Mexico, about 8,000 feet above sea-level, where yellow fever is out of<lb/>
the question.</p>

<p>98<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>The &ldquo;calamities&rdquo; of this and the immediately preceding year are noted<lb/>
in a number of other records: the <hi rend="italic">Codex Aubin</hi> (plate 69),<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Anales<lb/>
de Chimalpahin</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Tecamachalco</hi>, the histories of Sahag&uacute;n<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> and of</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> It is always well to consult original documents, and when this is impossible<lb/>
one is at a disadvantage. There is ever a chance of error in quotation or tran-<lb/>
scription, and even slight errors may be important. The original pre-Columbian<lb/>
manuscript, of which the <hi rend="italic">Codex Telleriano-Remensis</hi> is a copy, is not available;<lb/>
it is quite certainly destroyed; but there is another copy, the <hi rend="italic">Codex Rios (Vati-<lb/>
canus</hi> 3738), a photostat of which is accessible. Both are evidently made from<lb/>
the same original and about the same time, and both are illuminated in the same<lb/>
colors. The <hi rend="italic">Vaticanus</hi> has no explanatory text with its glyphs, nor Arabic num-<lb/>
erals to indicate the years; both of which it had certainly had if it had been copied<lb/>
from the <hi rend="italic">Codex Telleriano-Remensis</hi>. It was apparently copied in 1564, and the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Codex Telleriano-Remensis</hi> in 1562, from a manuscript which ended in 1555. There<lb/>
is one phrase in Latin in the <hi rend="italic">Vaticanus</hi>, under the glyph for Tenochtitlan<lb/>
(whether by the copyist or added later one does not know) which is not in the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Telleriano-Remensis</hi>. The glyphs for this year, &ldquo;1 Rabbit,&rdquo; in both are essentially<lb/>
the same, but the differences, though slight, are, for us, important. In the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Vaticanus, none of the figures are represented as vomiting</hi>--all have their mouths<lb/>
shut; and the material which I have indicated as vomit is not especially like worms.</p>
<p>I am much inclined to think that &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Preste Juan de las Yndias</hi>&rdquo; made the more<lb/>
accurate copy, yet there is no relation between what, to us, is the distinctive<lb/>
feature of his drawing and his own (Spanish) text. Had we had only the <hi rend="italic">Vati-<lb/>
canus</hi> there had never been any claim that this drawing represented an epidemic<lb/>
characterized by vomiting.</p>
<p>We may note also in the <hi rend="italic">Codex Aubin</hi> (plate 69) that for the previous year, &ldquo;13<lb/>
House&rdquo; (1453), a hail storm is shown beating upon the corn; and the corresponding<lb/>
entry in Nahuatl states: &ldquo;the famine commenced.&rdquo; The year &ldquo;2 Reed&rdquo; (1455)<lb/>
following the year &ldquo;1 Rabbit,&rdquo; shows a heavy mortality--a bird eating a corpse<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">in the open</hi>--but nothing to indicate an epidemic.</p>
<p>Is it possible that <hi rend="italic">Preste Juan</hi> was influenced by the tradition of the &ldquo;maya<lb/>
cimlal&rdquo; in Yucatan about 1485? The tradition of it must have been known to the<lb/>
Mexicans of his time, and the gruesome and unusual seems to have a fascination<lb/> 
for people in a certain stage of culture. He may thus have made his drawing show<lb/>
his people die vomiting worms instead of simply dying as does the drawing in the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Vaticanus</hi>, but I am rather unwilling to believe it. One would like much to see<lb/>
the original manuscript, the &ldquo;Jewels&rdquo; found by <hi rend="italic">Preste Juan</hi> in 1562.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Padre Sahag&uacute;n (1829-30) vol. 2, p. 269) says that this four years' famine was<lb/>
called &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">nocetochviloe</hi>,&rdquo; one of the words he left in the original when he translated<lb/>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>

<p>Torquemada, all of which give a clear history of three or four years of<lb/>
unusual cold which, with hail or snow beating down the corn, destroyed<lb/>
the crops, and from this came the famine from which so many died.<lb/>
Even the <hi rend="italic">Codex Telleriano-Remensis</hi> gives: &ldquo;year of 7 Reed, 1447 accord<lb/>
ing to ours, there were so great snows that men died,&rdquo; and pictures the<lb/>
snow or hail and dying men. To quote Torquemada (vol. 1, pp. 158-59),<lb/>
who gives as his authority: &ldquo;This affirm the histories and paintings<lb/> 
of that time . . . . There was an almost universal hunger in all the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">tierra fria</hi>, because, when the grain was in milk, great hail fell one time<lb/>
after another (<hi rend="italic">vnos Dias tras otros</hi>) and broke it all down, and this year<lb/>
they gathered no maize.&rdquo; (The <hi rend="italic">Anales</hi> say: &ldquo;not much they harvested.&rdquo;)<lb/>
&ldquo;They lived this year on last year's supply without much hunger.&rdquo;<lb/>
The following year &ldquo;there came again Ices&rdquo;--hail storms doubtless--<lb/>
&ldquo;which beat down everything and there was great hunger in the land.&rdquo;<lb/>
The next year &ldquo;there fell no rain from heaven, and the sun scorched<lb/>
the earth nor, because they had no grain to plant and it was cold, did the<lb/>
fourth year lack of being also very hurtful. There resulted then at this<lb/>
time a great hunger and the people ate wild roots and unclean things in<lb/>
the woods, and many died, and they sold their children for maize . . . .<lb/>
a damsel for 400 ears of maize and a youth for 500 ears.&rdquo; Torquemada<lb/> 
adds that it was from the Totonecques that they bought maize and to<lb/>
these that they sold their children.</p>
<p>This famine, which had lasted more or less from 1447 (grasshoppers<lb/>
preceded the cold), was followed by a year of much rain and great<lb/>
abundance. All agree on this. Chimalpahin also notes for 1456:<lb/>
&ldquo;year 3 Knife . . . . great abundance . . . . pestilence reigned severely.&rdquo;<lb/>
No one else notes this pestilence. It may have been either a pestilence<lb/>
localized to one district, or an error.</p>
<p>Father Torquemada is led to marvel at this reverse, in Mexico, of the<lb/>
condition which had prevailed in Egypt in the time of Joseph, where the<lb/>
lean years had followed those of great abundance, instead of preceding<lb/>
them, and is decidedly critical of the Mexican method as compared with<lb/>
the Egyptian.</p>
<p>It is entirely true that the search for food, necessitated by a failure of<lb/>
crops caused by cold, almost inevitably would have brought about com-<lb/>
munications with warmer regions, as was the country of the Totonecques,</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>panied by all kinds of generalized misfortunes (see page 102). This word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">noceto-<lb/>
chviloe</hi>&rdquo; might, then, be translated: &ldquo;after the manner of 1 Rabbit;&rdquo; that is,<lb/>
&ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; or &ldquo;hurtful,&rdquo; the word used by Torquemada.</p>

<p>where the crops had not failed,<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> and hence there would be exposure to,<lb/>
and importation of, such communicable diseases as might exist in the<lb/>
regions visited. If yellow fever existed in these warm countries, it<lb/>
would, or might, have been contracted there by some of the men from<lb/>
the plateau going down. Some, travelling rapidly, might have devel-<lb/>
oped it on the plateau; but, unless either the climate of the valley of<lb/>
Mexico or the biology of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> or of the causative organism of yellow<lb/>
fever has undergone marked change since 1454, the disease would not<lb/>
have propagated itself there. It has been introduced very often in more<lb/>
modern times and has never done so. This epidemic in these localities<lb/>
could not have been yellow fever.</p>
<p>SICKNESS AND MORTALITY AFTER THE CONQUEST</p>
<p>During the period of, say, fifty to seventy-five years after the Con-<lb/>
quest, there are recorded a number of epidemics, mainly or exclusively<lb/>
of diseases introduced from Europe. Some of these are designated only<lb/>
by their Spanish names, or the Nahuatl equivalents; others are both<lb/>
named and described, and described as well as similar things elsewhere<lb/>
were described at this time. All of the historians of our first two groups<lb/>
mention some of them, the general epidemics, but as they lived in differ-<lb/>
ent regions, they do not all mention the more circumscribed epidemics.<lb/>
Mendieta gives, in general, the fullest account. He came to Mexico in<lb/>
1554 (Garc&iacute;a Icazbalceta, 1886-1892, vol. i, p. xi) but states that on the<lb/>
subject matter of his book he received much instruction, orally and in<lb/>
manuscript, from Padres Andr&eacute;s de Olmos and from Motolinia, who<lb/>
was appointed his guardian. These men had come in 1528 and 1524<lb/>
respectively. His is, then, practically a contemporary record from the<lb/>
Conquest to 1596, when it was finished during a mixed epidemic of<lb/>
measles, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">paperas</hi>&rdquo; (a swelling of the neck, either mumps or diphtheria),<lb/>
and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tabardillo</hi>&rdquo; (typhus).</p>
<p>An abbreviated account of the epidemics recorded in Mendieta's<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Historia Ecclesi&aacute;stica Indiana</hi> is given, with such interpolations from<lb/>
other sources as seem necessary. When no authority is given Men-<lb/>
dieta is meant (pp. 514 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Year 1520</hi>. Smallpox was introduced into the City of Mexico by a</p>

country of the Totonecques, although he places the Guastiques there): &ldquo;The heat<lb/>
is very strong in this country--no cacao is raised,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Spanish fruits are very<lb/>
common there.&rdquo; Brinton (1891, p. 139) places it in the present State of Vera<lb/>

<p>negro in the train of Narvaez, not long before the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Noche Triste</hi>&rdquo; (July 10,<lb/>
1520), when Cortez had to abandon the city. The epidemic did much<lb/>
to break the Mexican resistance against Cortez' return. It spread<lb/>
generally and gave a fearful mortality. All, even Bernal Diaz (1904,<lb/>
vol. i, p. 409), note this.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Year 1531</hi>. Measles prevailed, widespread and, to the good Father's<lb/>
astonishment, with a very heavy mortality, but less than that of small-<lb/>
pox. The translator of Chimalpahin (R&eacute;mi Sim&eacute;on) calls this &ldquo;small-<lb/>
pox, which . . . . made die the little children&rdquo; (Chimalpahin, p. 225),<lb/>
but Motolinia (pp. 13--14) agrees with Mendieta in calling it measles,<lb/>

pushing out (<hi rend="italic">pujamiento</hi>) of blood, joined with fevers, and so great<lb/>
was the blood that it gushed forth from the nostrils.&rdquo; This pestilence<lb/>
is noted by all of our historians, Spanish and Mexican, except Motolinia,<lb/>
whose book stops in 1544. The <hi rend="italic">Codex Telleriano-Remensis</hi> figures it as<lb/>
in both 1544 and 1545--dead men and women lying in a large pile.<lb/>
Chimalpahin gives: &ldquo;The year 1 House&rdquo; (1545) &ldquo;there was death; blood<lb/>
by the mouth; the eyes; the nose; the anus. Then perished extremely&rdquo;<lb/>
(many) &ldquo;nobles, men and women: also common people. Then dogs<lb/>
and jackals&rdquo; (coyotes?) &ldquo;fed on people in Chalco.&rdquo; Torquemada (vol.<lb/>
i, p. 643) states 800,000 died in Mexico. Mendieta gives 150,000 in<lb/>
Tlaxcala and 100,000 in Cholula, and other places in proportion.<lb/>
Sahag&uacute;n (1829-30) says: &ldquo;In that part of the City of Mexico called<lb/>
Tlaltelolco, where I was then residing, I buried more than 10,000 corpses<lb/>
and, towards the end of the epidemic, was myself attacked and near to<lb/>
dying.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">5</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> The first word used for smallpox, in Mexico, in 1520, was &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tohtomonaliztli</hi>&rdquo;--<lb/>
&ldquo;to have pustules.&rdquo; After this it appears as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">huey &ccedil;ahuatl</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;great pocks&rdquo;<lb/>
or eruption, and measles as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tepiton &ccedil;ahuatl</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;little pocks&rdquo; or eruption. The<lb/>
word used by Chimalpahin for this epidemic is &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">sahuatl</hi>&rdquo;--&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">the eruption</hi>,&rdquo; with-<lb/>
out any adjective. That it was especially fatal to young children is distinctive<lb/>
and adds evidence of the careful observation of our Mexican historian.</p>

Chimalpahin (pp. 246-47) gives: &ldquo;Year 6 Rabbit (1550) . . . . ma-<lb/>

and the translation is R&eacute;mi Sim&eacute;on's. Yet, bold as it seems to say it,<lb/>
this translation is clearly an error. In a note to Sahag&uacute;n's description<lb/>
of the great epidemic of 1576 (Sahag&uacute;n, 1880, p. 877), R&eacute;mi Sim&eacute;on<lb/>
translates this same word, used by the same writer, Chimalpahin, as<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">fi&eacute;vre verd&acirc;tre</hi>&rdquo; (bluish-green fever); and this is clearly correct, since his<lb/>
own dictionary, as do others, gives &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matlalli</hi>&rdquo; as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">verd&acirc;tre</hi>&rdquo; (bluish-green);<lb/>
and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">totonqui</hi>&rdquo; as &ldquo;heat: fever.&rdquo; This was quite certainly the same<lb/>
disease as prevailed in 1544-45 and in 1576-77, and, as on these oc-<lb/>
casions, it seems to have lasted into two years, prevailing through the<lb/>
winter.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Year 1564</hi>. The above was probably the same epidemic which, by<lb/>
Mendieta, is ascribed to 1564, going over from one year to the other.<lb/>
&ldquo;This was a year of high mortality,&rdquo; says Mendieta of 1564. This<lb/>
disease was not named or described by Mendieta, but was ascribed by<lb/>
him to a census of the Indians, taken by Valderrama--a thing which<lb/>
he states had likewise produced a pestilence in King David's time.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Year 1576</hi>. Mendieta: &ldquo;Came another pestilence, of which died a very<lb/>

<p><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> The use of the plural, &ldquo;others,&rdquo; looks as if he included the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mortalidad</hi>&rdquo; of<lb/>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
103</p>
<p>Chimalpahin (trans. by R&eacute;mi Sim&eacute;on, pp. 288-292) gives: &ldquo;The year<lb/>
6 Knife&rdquo; (1576) . . . . &ldquo;Then began in the country of Amaqu&eacute;m&eacute;can-Chalco<lb/>
the sickness called &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">cocoliztli</hi>&rsquo; (epidemic); it began in August and was not<lb/>
very strong; but it was above all extremely grave in the month of<lb/> 
September when it raged 30 days; whilst the great epidemic lasted<lb/>
reigned the <hi rend="italic">matlaltotonqui (pleur&eacute;sie)</hi>; blood came out without effort<lb/>
by the mouth and by the nose and brought death; there was no remedy,<lb/>
also, great numbers of people died in all New Spain . . . . Then it<lb/>
froze during XV days of the said month of September and that continued<lb/>
during XXXI days of October; the mortality reigned at the same time.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">8</hi></p>
<p>The epidemic lasted into the next year: &ldquo;Through XXXI days of<lb/>
January, XXVIII days of February and XXXI days of March continued<lb/>
the epidemic . . . . after that time the evil diminished a little.&rdquo; The <hi rend="italic">Anales<lb/>
de Tecamachalco</hi> (p. 64 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>) also give the names of a number of Span-<lb/>
iards, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">personas de consideraci&oacute;n</hi>,&rdquo; dying of it in 1577--one on February<lb/>
11--and the disease was evidently still prevalent at that time. Tor-<lb/>
quemada (vol. i, p. 643) gives the mortality of this epidemic as 2,000,000<lb/>
--an estimate, of course, as was that of 800,000 for the epidemic of 1544<lb/>
and 1545.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Year 1588</hi>. &ldquo;From a scarcity of maize many died.&rdquo;<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Year 1595</hi>. &ldquo;At the end of the year 1595 and the beginning of 1596,<lb/>
at which time I write, there reigns a most general pestilence mixed of<lb/>
measles, <hi rend="italic">paperas</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">tabardillo</hi> (typhus) that scarcely a man remains on<lb/>
his feet,&rdquo; says Mendieta (p. 515), . . . . &ldquo;although less mortal than the<lb/>
previous ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have not pretended to note every writer who mentioned each epi-<lb/>
demic. All mention the general ones which occurred in their times, and<lb/>
most of them mention some smaller local ones, which I have not given.<lb/>
I think, however, that the eight epidemics and the two years of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mortali-<lb/>
dad</hi>&rdquo; from general failure of crops, in 76 years--and there were other<lb/>
local famines noted--show that our historians were awake to the con-<lb/>
sideration of such things, and that up to 1576, at any rate, when nearly<lb/>
all of them were recording these epidemics (six in 55 years after the Con-<lb/>
quest), any considerable outbreak of mortality among either Spaniards<lb/>
or Indians had been noted. It was to bring out this, their <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> value,</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">8</hi> The word rendered by R&eacute;mi Sim&eacute;on as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">gela</hi>&rdquo; (froze), about which there<lb/>

and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tzicoa</hi>,&rdquo; to fix solidly, hence &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">cold fixed solidly</hi>&rdquo;--i.e. frozen. Compare<lb/>
this and the year 1558 with 1454, in which deaths are also ascribed solely to famine<lb/>
without an epidemic.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>as <hi rend="italic">evidence that an epidemic not noted did not occur</hi>, that this matter has<lb/>
been studied so extensively.</p>
<p>As to these epidemics, the only question is as to the nature of those,<lb/>
quite certainly the same, of 1544-45 and of 1576-77, characterized by<lb/>
such high mortality and abundant hemorrhages through the mouth and<lb/>
other orifices of the body. Considering the locality--the <hi rend="italic">tierra fria</hi>--<lb/>
and the time of the year--lasting through the winter--it seems not worth<lb/>
while to discuss the possibility of yellow fever, even if we had not men-<lb/>
tion of the unusual cold in the account of Chimalpahin and others; not<lb/>
more than in the epidemics with similar symptoms in Dublin, in the<lb/>
winter of 1826-27, and in Dundee and Glasgow, in 1843. Mendieta, I<lb/>
think, settles the question. He unquestionably considers the epidemics<lb/>
of 1544 and 1576 the same, and from the use of the plural &ldquo;others,&rdquo;<lb/>
implies that there had been at least <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of the same kind (1544-45 and<lb/>
1563-64) before 1576. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Tabardillo</hi>&rdquo; was, in Spain at this time, the<lb/>
current name for typhus fever, and possibly sometimes for scarlet fever,<lb/>
probably on account of its eruption; and when Mendieta said &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">y daba<lb/>
en tabardillo</hi>,&rdquo; he quite certainly meant the typhus eruption. So, in his<lb/>
account of the mixed epidemic of 1595-96, is his use of the same word<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tabardillo</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Probable typhus, 1526</hi>. The deaths of the Licentiate Luis Ponce de<lb/>
Leon, of Padre Ortiz, and of young Aguilar, recorded by Bernal Diaz<lb/>
(1904-05, v. 2, p. 362-365) as dying in Mexico City of a &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>,&rdquo; in<lb/>
1526, were quite certainly due to typhus. Cortez (1866, p. 482) gives an<lb/>
account of this matter in a letter to Charles V, under date of September<lb/>
3, 1526: &ldquo;. . . . and in this time the said Luis Ponce . . . . fell sick and<lb/>
all as many as came in the armada in which he came. Of which sickness<lb/>
it pleased Our Lord that he should die and more than thirty others of<lb/>
those who came in the armada, among whom died two friars of the order<lb/>
of Sto. Domingo, who came with him, and up to today there are many<lb/>
persons sick and in much danger of death; for what they brought with<lb/>
them has appeared almost like a pestilence&rdquo; (i.e. a communicable disease)<lb/>
&ldquo;for it attacked even some of those who had been living here (<hi rend="italic">que ac&aacute;<lb/>
estaban</hi>) and two died of the same sickness and there are many others<lb/>
who have not recovered from it,&rdquo; that is, are still sick.</p>
<p>Ponce landed at Medellin, two leagues from the port of San Juan de<lb/>
Ulua, and came direct and &ldquo;without delaying&rdquo; to Mexico City. The<lb/>
date of his landing we do not know, nor the date of his arrival in Mexico<lb/>
City, nor the date of his falling sick, nor that of his death. This is rather<lb/>
usual in Spanish chronicles of the period. <hi rend="italic">What</hi> happened was of more<lb/>
<pb n="105" id="Cb000119"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
105<lb/>
importance to them than <hi rend="italic">when</hi> it happened. The writer was surprised<lb/>
to see that the Cortez letters were dated.</p>
<p>The messenger, announcing Ponce's arrival at Medellin, reached Cor-<lb/>
tez in Mexico City on June 25, (&ldquo;the day following St. John's Day&rdquo;),<lb/>
and Ponce followed him closely. He stopped when two leagues outside<lb/>
of the city to communicate with Cortez, and lay there until the next day.<lb/>
He presented his credentials two days later. The beginning of his sick-<lb/>
ness is given by Cortez (p. 371) in another letter (September 11, 1526)<lb/>
as occurring in the night after this day (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">aquella misma noche</hi>&rdquo;). The<lb/>
same letter says that he died &ldquo;eighteen or nineteen days after his arrival<lb/>
in the city.&rdquo; Either, then, he was sick sixteen or seventeen days or, if<lb/>
he died on the ninth day of his illness, &ldquo;lying somnolent, passing four<lb/>
days, night and day, in sleep,&rdquo; as Bernal Diaz (1904-05, vol. 2, p. 362)<lb/>
states, he had been in the city longer than Cortez says before the attack.<lb/>
The first is much the more probable. The date of his attack, then,<lb/>
would have been near the end of June or in very early July; and the sick-<lb/>
ness alleged to have been introduced by him lasted, according to Cortez,<lb/>
some two and a half months at least.</p>
<p>Cortez was fifteen days en route from Medellin to Mexico, his journey<lb/>
being made about ten days earlier. There were reasons for haste, and<lb/>
he was a most energetic man, as indeed was Ponce. Even if Ponce had<lb/>
covered the distance in half of this time, the onset of his attack had been<lb/>
at least ten days from leaving Medellin . . . . well past the incubation<lb/>
period of yellow fever from possible exposure there, but, even if he took<lb/>
as long as Cortez, within that of typhus. If this were typhus, as seems<lb/>
not improbable, this was quite certainly its earliest introduction from<lb/>
Spain into Mexico of which we have any knowledge. It is fair to say,<lb/>
however, that as Cortez was accused of poisoning the Licentiate at the<lb/>
banquet, the date of which apparently determined the date he gives for<lb/>
the onset of the illness, he may have laid more stress on the ship-origin<lb/>
of this sickness than he would otherwise have done. Still, he agrees<lb/>
fairly well with Bernal Diaz--as far as the latter notices this sickness-<lb/>
and I am inclined to accept his basic statements, namely, that there was<lb/>
a small epidemic among the Spaniards in Mexico City soon after the<lb/>
arrival of Ponce, beginning among those who came with him and later<lb/>
attacking some who had been residing in that city.</p>
<p>It, I think, was almost certainly typhus. Only the Spaniards are<lb/>
reported as having it, and there was evidently no great spread among<lb/>
Indians: a small spread would not have been noted. Possibly its vec-<lb/>
tor, the body louse, was not indigenous to America and was not suffi-<lb/>
ciently disseminated, even in the City of Mexico, at this time, only five<lb/>

vol. i, p. 352 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>) calls these epidemics of 1545 and 1576, along with a<lb/>
number of subsequent ones, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matlazahuatl</hi>,&rdquo; apparently on the authority<lb/>
of Torquemada, although he does not quote him directly. I can find<lb/>
this word in no Nahuatl or early Spanish writer--although, as there are<lb/>
nearly 3,000 folio pages in Torquemada's <hi rend="italic">Monarquia Indiana</hi>, and no<lb/>
index, it may have been overlooked. It is called &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">pestilencia</hi>,&rdquo;<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mortalidad</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">epid&eacute;mia</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">cocoliztle</hi>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matlaltotonqui</hi>&rdquo; by them.<lb/>
This word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matlazahuatl</hi>,&rdquo; however, is used by R&eacute;mi Sim&eacute;on in a note of<lb/>
his own at the end of his translation of Sahag&uacute;n's <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> (p. 877) as if<lb/>
it were well known as applicable to the epidemic of 1576-77; and from its<lb/>
meaning he judged that &ldquo;the spots the disease produced had a bluish-<lb/>
green (<hi rend="italic">verd&acirc;tre</hi>) aspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the statement of Humboldt (1811, vol. i, p. 344-352)<lb/>
quoted by, I think, every writer who has touched on this subject since<lb/>
his time, that this disease was absolutely confined to Indians and the<lb/>
dark-skinned of the mixed races, many Spaniards died of it. Torque-<lb/>
mada says: &ldquo;. . . . even of the ministers who confessed them many ac-<lb/>
companied them in death, because as they were continuous in minister-<lb/>
ing to them, the sickness (which was contagious) struck them and in a<lb/>
few days died many of the brothers of St. Francis, who perished in this<lb/>
work.&rdquo; In the <hi rend="italic">Anales de Tecamachalco</hi> (p. 64 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>), probably twenty<lb/>
Spaniards, <hi rend="italic">&ldquo;personas de consideraci&oacute;n</hi>,&rdquo; are mentioned by name as<lb/>
dying of it in one district. Sahag&uacute;n, however, (<hi rend="italic">vide infra</hi>) certainly im-<lb/>
plies a greater destructiveness to Indians than to Spaniards. To typhus,<lb/>
which had been very prevalent in Spain since 1557, and endemic since<lb/>
1490, a considerable number of Spaniards should have been immune by<lb/>
previous attack.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matlazahuatl</hi>&rdquo; has always been surrounded with mystery, some<lb/>
considering it yellow fever; but more generally it was believed to have<lb/>
been a disease indigenous and peculiar to the Mexican highlands and to<lb/>
which Europeans were not subject. If there was such a disease, from<lb/>
time to time epidemic there, characterized by vomiting of blood and</p>

<p>other hemorrhages, it has disappeared, as the only endemic diseases--<lb/>
from time to time becoming epidemic--prevailing in the highlands now<lb/>
are smallpox and typhus fever, the latter known by the same name as in<lb/>
Mendieta's time, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tabardillo</hi>,&rdquo; and apparently identical in symptoms,<lb/>
epidemiology, and vector with the typhus of the Old World, from which<lb/>
the writer believes it to have been introduced.</p>
<p>Moreover, the word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matlazahuatl</hi>&rdquo; clearly implies an eruption.<lb/>
Smallpox was &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">hueyzahuatl</hi>&rdquo;--the large pocks or eruption; measles was<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tepitonzahuatl</hi>&rdquo;--little pocks or eruption; and this disease, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matlaza-<lb/>
huatl</hi>,&rdquo; could only be the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matla</hi>,&rdquo; pocks or eruption; and the diction-<lb/>
aries of R&eacute;mi Sim&eacute;on, Molina, Biondelli, and the Licentiate Robelo,<lb/>
all give the root of this word (<hi rend="italic">matlal</hi>) as meaning a color--not always<lb/>
the same color, however.</p>
<p>Mendieta unquestionably believed that he was dealing with typhus,<lb/>
and the history of the introduction of typhus into Mexico is definite,<lb/>
we believe, in 1526; surely in 1570. That typhus, as had been measles<lb/>
and smallpox, would be much more malignant among a race virgin to it,<lb/>
and in a community almost entirely susceptible, is very probable. It is<lb/>
now severe enough, but no more so in Mexico than in Europe and North<lb/>
Africa. Or one might hazard a guess, and not an improbable one, that<lb/>
not only was the epidemic of 1595-96, but those of 1544 and 1576 as well<lb/>
(we have no account of hemorrhage, nor indeed any description of the<lb/>
disease in 1563 and 1564), mixed, of typhus and relapsing fever, such<lb/>
as occurred in Dublin in the winter of 1826-27 (Graves, 1848), and in<lb/>
Dundee and Edinburgh in 1843 (Arrott, 1844; Cormack, 1843; Craigie,<lb/>
1843; and David Smith, 1844). The two diseases have the same vector,<lb/>
and in Europe were frequently associated, as, indeed, they are now<lb/>
(1923) so reported in Eastern Europe. I have no explanation of the<lb/>
deaths characterized by vomiting, apparently of worms, figured in the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Codex Telleriano-Remensis</hi> as occurring in 1454, unless it was that this<lb/>
was a usual result--or at least one that impressed the historian--from<lb/>
the use of improper food, due to the &ldquo;hunger&rdquo; that prevailed. Diarrhea<lb/>
rather than vomiting, although both occurred, was a common terminal<lb/>
symptom of starvation among the Cuban <hi rend="italic">reconcentrados</hi>, as the writer<lb/>
knew of it in 1899. Profuse vomiting, however, from any cause, in<lb/>
people living under primitive conditions, is not unusually accompanied<lb/>
by the vomiting of worms (lumbricoids). P&egrave;re Labat (1722, vol. i, p. 73)<lb/>
gives as part of his description of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>&rdquo; of 1694: &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">quelque<lb/>
fois on rendoient paquets de vers de differents grandeurs &amp; couleurs</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Sahag&uacute;n--a good man and a strong man--completed his book<lb/>
during the epidemic of 1576, and his account (vol. iii, pp. 328-335) is so<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
human a document and appeals so strongly to all who, like the writer,<lb/>
have seen and felt the agony of a plague-stricken city, that one can<lb/>
scarcely help giving some of it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But alas! in this year of 1576, in the month of August, an epidemic<lb/>
as universal as great began. It has lasted three months: many are<lb/>
already dead and each day more die. I do not know how long this one<lb/>
will last or what will be the extent of the evil. I am now in the City of<lb/>
Mexico, in the part called Tlaltelolco, and I see, from the moment that it<lb/>
began up to this day, the 8th day of November, the number of dead<lb/>
increases day by day, from ten to twenty to thirty to forty to fifty to<lb/>
sixty to eighty. I do not know what it will be in the future. . . .Many will<lb/>
die of hunger and of having no care. It has happened and is now hap-<lb/>
pening, in many houses, that all of them fall sick without leaving one who<lb/>
can give them a cup of water. And in order to administer the sacra-<lb/>
ments in many places there is no one to come to the church nor to tell us<lb/>
they are sick. When this is known, the monks walk from house to<lb/>
house, confessing and consoling them. When this pestilence began . . .<lb/>
the clergy and monks, as of St. Francis, so of St. Dominic and of St.<lb/>
Augustin and the Jesuits, walked from house to house to confess and<lb/>
console them, and this lasted for two months and then ceased entirely,<lb/>
because some were tired and some were sick and others occupied on their<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">haciendas</hi>. Now already many priests fail to come, those who were aid-<lb/>
ing and those who were not aiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this pueblo of Tlaltelolco only the brothers of St. Francis are now<lb/>
walking from house to house confessing and consoling them and giving<lb/>
the bread of Castile&rdquo; (wheaten bread) &ldquo;to eat, bought by our own alms,<lb/>
and that seems about to stop, for bread is very dear and the Brothers go<lb/>
sick and tired, for which there is a great tribulation and affliction . . . .<lb/>
Please Our Lord to remedy this so great plague, because, if it lasts much<lb/>
longer, all will be finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tells, just as he ends the book, of a prophecy that all the Canary<lb/>
Islanders and all the Indians of New Spain are to die within seventy<lb/>
years of the coming of the Spaniards. &ldquo;This prophecy I had not cred-<lb/>
ited, but the things that have happened, and are happening, appear<lb/>
about to prove its truth&rdquo; . . . . &ldquo;for if this business, which now is, goes<lb/>
forward three or four months as it now goes, there will remain no one (<hi rend="italic">no<lb/>
quedar&aacute; nadie</hi>).&rdquo; Evidently the effect of the disease was mainly con-<lb/>
fined to the Indians, for he adds: &ldquo;It seems that the race will be entirely<lb/>
destroyed and the land left to wild beasts and forest. It would be then<lb/>
uninhabitable, there not being enough Spaniards in it to hold it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the last paragraph of the llth book, with which the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> really<lb/>
ends, his faith revives, and he believes &ldquo;that the epidemic will cease soon<lb/>
<pb n="109" id="Cb000123"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
109<lb/>
and that there will remain enough&rdquo; (Indians) &ldquo;to give the Spanish time<lb/>
to multiply and colonize the country, so that, the one race lacking&rdquo;--<lb/>
still the prophecy--&ldquo;it will remain peopled by another, that is the<lb/>
Spanish, and I even hold that there will be always a quantity of Indians<lb/>
in these lands.&rdquo; Ending his work with this hope--which time has<lb/>
justified.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Scant records of sickness by Diaz del Castillo</hi>. Taking up the second<lb/>
group of Spanish historians, the only reference I find by Bernal Diaz to<lb/>
any sickness, besides the smallpox among the Indians in 1520 and the<lb/>
deaths of three prominent people in Mexico City of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>&rdquo; in 1526,<lb/>
to which we have alluded, and the <hi rend="italic">mal de buas</hi> (venereal disease), is the<lb/>
following:</p>
<p>After his disastrous retreat from Mexico City, when Cortez was at<lb/>
Saltocan, six leagues distant therefrom, &ldquo;he saw many of our soldiers<lb/>
wounded and suffering and that there had died eight of pain in the side and<lb/>
of throwing off clotted blood mixed with mud by the mouth and nostrils<lb/>
and this was from their being broken down by the arms which we ever<lb/>
carried and because of the continual going along the trails and the dust<lb/>
which we swallowed of necessity.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">10</hi> This probably was pneumonia.<lb/>
Considering the locality and that they had been living in Mexico City<lb/>
for a long time, it was not yellow fever.<hi rend="superscript">11</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">10</hi> <hi rend="italic">Se avian muerto ocho de dolor de costado y de hechar sangre quaxada rrevuelta<lb/>
con lodo por la boca y narizes</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Diaz del Castillo</hi>: 1904-05, <hi rend="italic">vol</hi>. 2, <hi rend="italic">cap.</hi> 140).</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">11</hi> Dr. M. E. Connor, of the International Health Board (personal communica-<lb/>
tion), had a case or cases of pneumonia presented to him in the summer or fall of<lb/>
1923 in Mexico for yellow fever, on account of the bloody sputum. The writer is<lb/>
quite sure that the great epidemic of 1759, &ldquo;during the time of ices,&rdquo; noted by<lb/>
Ulloa (1772, p. 200) in the Andean Plateau, which, with others, maybe of a differ-<lb/>
ent nature, gave rise to the reports of yellow fever at Quito, Cuzco, and Cerro<lb/>
de Pasco, was an epidemic of influenza-pneumonia. Dr. Unanue's description, of<lb/>
which I have never seen mention, makes this very clear to me. He calls it &ldquo;a<lb/>
malignant catarrh,&rdquo; and gives as symptoms &ldquo;excessive prostration, pain in all<lb/>
the body, especially in the costal regions, spitting of blood, rapid respirations,<lb/>
and little fever&rdquo; (Unanue, 1815, pp. 25 and 124).</p>
<p>This is quoted, indeed, for the description of the epidemic of 1720, on the same<lb/>
plateau, characterized as &ldquo;the most fearful pestilence that ever devastated Peru,&rdquo;<lb/>
but Dr. Unanue at this point states that &ldquo;this pestilence of 1759 at Lima was the<lb/>
same as that of 1720 inland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulloa (<hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>) gives nearly the same description as above, but adds: &ldquo;blood<lb/>
by the mouth and the nose.&rdquo; He states that it was very general. &ldquo;Had it been<lb/>
as fatal as universal the race had been exterminated.&rdquo; He adds that it appeared<lb/>
very suddenly, coming up from the south, spread with extreme rapidity and dis-<lb/>
appeared the same way, and that the great comet of 1759 also came up from the<lb/>
south and did the same way.</p>
<p>Most of these Andean epidemics, however, including that of Quito and Cuzco<lb/>
of 1720, have, in the opinion of the writer, been typhus.</p>

<p>HERRERA'S ACCOUNT OF UNHEALTHFULNESS</p>
<p>All of the epidemics hitherto noted have been in the Mexican plateau,<lb/>
and it may be that the writer has wasted time in discussing them. Her-<lb/>
rera, however, although writing at Madrid at a somewhat later date<lb/>
(published first in 1601) and from the data of others, pays attention to<lb/>
the low country, especially the coast about Vera Cruz--of which city he<lb/>
is in nowise an admirer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It rains from April to . . . September,&rdquo; as it still does. &ldquo;There is no<lb/>
running water,&rdquo; hence water would be stored, &ldquo;and the rain sinks in the<lb/>
sand.&rdquo; During this season &ldquo;the strong sun draws out the dampness and<lb/>
with the very sultry weather places it in the nostrils whence it appears<lb/>
that it pierces to the brain and gives fevers (<hi rend="italic">calenturas</hi>) which very few<lb/>
escape; clearly it is seen that this vapor is poisonous, because even the<lb/>
Plaza of the city is made a marsh in the time of rains and gives birth<lb/>
each morning to thousands of little animals . . . with tails and with feet,<lb/>
and in a few days the tails fall off and they show as great toads giving<lb/>
at night frightful voices. Moreover, it is close to a river which, although<lb/>
good water and drunk daily is made&rdquo; (as hot as) &ldquo;broth and to the people<lb/>
going out in the sun . . . . these bad vapors and the hot waters give<lb/>
sicknesses; and the same in all the Coast of the North from Panuco to<lb/>
Guazacoalco&rdquo; (Coatzacoalco?). &ldquo;From November to March there is<lb/>
no rain and strong north winds make it cold and then, when the land is<lb/>
dry, it is as healthy as Mexico&rdquo; (Herrera, 1726-27, <hi rend="italic">dec.</hi> iv, <hi rend="italic">lib.</hi> ix,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">cap.</hi> vi).</p>
<p>There is nothing in this account enlightening us as to the <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> of<lb/>
the sickness at Vera Cruz and along the coast. The implication seems<lb/>
rather that it was very prevalent than that it was very deadly. The<lb/>
physical conditions were favorable for both malaria and yellow fever.<lb/>
Unquestionably, in addition to the abhorred batrachians, the plaza bred<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Anopheles</hi> mosquitoes--probably <hi rend="italic">albimanus</hi> as now--and, with the in-<lb/>
troduction of human carriers from Spain or Africa, which had surely<lb/>
taken place before Herrera's time, malaria would be prevalent in Vera<lb/>
Cruz and in much of this coast. Also, although close to a river of pota-<lb/>
110<lb/>
<pb n="111" id="Cb000125"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
111<lb/>
ble water, the conditions were conducive to storing water, and hence, if<lb/>
the insect vector of yellow fever and its causative organism were there,<lb/>
this disease would propagate in proportion to the number of susceptible<lb/>
people supplied. Vera Cruz was the port of entry and of departure of<lb/>
Spaniards to and from the Mexican plateau, and the heavy immigration<lb/>
soon after the Conquest might, and probably would, have been sufficient<lb/>
to continue yellow fever in permanence here. Whether Indians from<lb/>
the plateau were brought to the port for labor soon after the Conquest,<lb/>
as they come now, we have no knowledge.</p>
<p>The paragraph of Herrera, however, which is always cited in evidence<lb/>
of the presence of yellow fever on this coast before the Conquest is the<lb/>
following (<hi rend="italic">op. cit., dec</hi>. iv, <hi rend="italic">lib</hi>. ix, <hi rend="italic">cap.</hi> viii).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the sickness called <hi rend="italic">Cocoliztle</hi> and for which cause the Coast of the<lb/>
North of New-Spain is depopulated . . . . I have already said that the<lb/>
City of Vera Cruz is sickly and all the Coast of the North, being a hot<lb/>
country where all diseases are more fatal because the heat of the region<lb/>
adds itself to the natural heat&rdquo; (of fever?) &ldquo;and does not allow the sick<lb/>
man to recuperate because the hot air prevents him, and children are not<lb/> 
raised because with any kind of a disorder a fever supervenes. For this<lb/>
cause the coast is found depopulated and the reason why it had so many<lb/>
people in the time of Montezuma is that, although it had the same<lb/>
diseases prevalent, which they call <hi rend="italic">Cocoliztle</hi>, and in some years more<lb/>
than others, as is the case now, Montezuma was accustomed, in view of<lb/>
the mortality and lack of population in those lands, to draw from Mexico,<lb/>
and from other pueblos where there were many people, eight thousand<lb/>
families, and this number of eight thousand families they called <hi rend="italic">&lsquo;zexiqui-<lb/>
pil,&rsquo;</hi><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> and sent them to people where there had been a great <hi rend="italic">Cocoliztle</hi><lb/>
and gave them houses and lands and made them free of tribute for<lb/>
many years, and thus he returned to re-people the coast whenever there<lb/>
was need, without making any lack in the pueblos whence he drew them,<lb/>
and thus they give the name <hi rend="italic">Cocoliztle</hi> to the smallpox when generally<lb/>
prevalent . . . and to other universal deadly sicknesses.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p>
<p>There is no question about the general unhealthfulness of this coast<lb/>
at the time Herrera wrote. Malaria, introduced by Spaniards or negroes,<lb/>
would of itself make it so, both to Spaniards and Indians, and could<lb/>
readily account for the difficulty in raising children--more readily than</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Ce--one; <hi rend="italic">xiquipilli</hi>--8,000. The word means &ldquo;an eight thousand&rdquo;; &ldquo;a unit<lb/>
of eight thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">cocoliztle</hi>&rdquo; is about equivalent to our &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo; or, it may be,<lb/>
&ldquo;epidemic of a dangerous disease.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="112" id="Cb000126"/>
<p>112<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>yellow fever. Indeed, the heat itself would do that for white children.<lb/>
The custom he ascribes to Montezuma, however, predicates a prevalent,<lb/>
fatal sickness, permanently endemic prior to the Conquest, and fatal to<lb/>
the natives. On what is this statement based? As I have said, I<lb/>
think we now have more, and more trustworthy, data on the Mexico<lb/>
before the Conquest than Herrera could have had, and I find no allusion<lb/>
to any such custom in any record I have been able to see, although many<lb/>
of them, as Torquemada's <hi rend="italic">Monarchia Indiana;</hi> Sahag&uacute;n's <hi rend="italic">Historia gen-<lb/>
eral de las cosas de Nueva Espa&ntilde;a;</hi> Motolinia's <hi rend="italic">Historia de los Indios<lb/>
de la Nueva Espa&ntilde;a;</hi> and Diego Dur&aacute;n's book, are very full of the<lb/>
accounts of native customs. The same is true of some of the Nahuatl<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">codices and anales</hi>. All of these are contemporary, or nearly contempo-<lb/>
rary, accounts, and their authors would have mentioned this custom had<lb/>
they known of it.</p>
<p>The knowledge of the Spaniards that the coast about Vera Cruz was<lb/>
extremely unhealthful at this time, when Herrera was writing, with no<lb/>
knowledge of its previous sanitary condition, would naturally lead to<lb/>
some such belief as that of the periodic introduction of population from<lb/>
what were then healthful regions, to explain the otherwise inexplicable<lb/>
fact that these lowlands were well populated when first visited. They<lb/>
knew of such movement of population <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> as common practice of<lb/>
the Babylonian and Assyrian kings, and it would naturally suggest itself<lb/>
to an ecclesiastical writer as a magnificent exercise of absolute power and<lb/>
of a wise and beneficent paternalism which they were very prone to<lb/>
ascribe to the rulers of the Aztec Empire. On the other hand, Jourdanet,<lb/>
an eminent student of early Mexican history, concludes (in a note to his<lb/>
translation of Sahag&uacute;n's &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Historia&rdquo;</hi>) that the <hi rend="italic">tierra caliente</hi> was as well<lb/>
populated before the Conquest and as healthful to the natives as any<lb/>
part of the plateau, and gives reasons for his belief. Similarly, Nicolas<lb/>
de Witte, a friar of the Order of St. Augustine, states that the Province<lb/>
of Huasteca, a Maya settlement on the Panuco river, was densely<lb/>
peopled, &ldquo;none more so under the sun,&rdquo; when he visited it in 1543, too<lb/>
close to the Conquest to admit of marked increase of population since<lb/>
that event (Terneaux-Compans, 1840, p. 254). There are many other<lb/>
statements which one could quote, showing that the <hi rend="italic">tierra caliente</hi> was as<lb/>
fully populated at and before the time of the Conquest as the plateau.</p>
<p>Indeed, had the alleged &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">cocoliztle</hi>&rdquo; been yellow fever, and had it been<lb/>
permanently endemic in this region about Vera Cruz, we know that there<lb/>
would have been no depopulation of the locality on this account. The<lb/>
population would be immunized in infancy; and while there would be an<lb/>
<pb n="113" id="Cb000127"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
113<lb/>
increase of infant mortality, it would not be excessive, and the adult<lb/>
native population would not be affected. From yellow fever there would<lb/>
never have been any need of a periodic repopulation, unless in those<lb/>
parts of a large regional focus through which the infection passed at very<lb/>
long intervals. Malaria will depopulate a community in which it con-<lb/>
tinuously abides--yellow fever never. Moreover, one can scarcely con-<lb/>
ceive of a more effective method to continue the infection of yellow<lb/>
fever in a region than the method described by Herrera to obviate its<lb/>
ill effects.</p>
<p>It seems, then, to be more than questionable if this account of Herrera<lb/>
is correct. If correct, the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">cocoliztle,</hi>&rdquo; which this repopulation was<lb/>
supposed to remedy, could not reasonably be considered yellow fever.<lb/>
The writer believes that there were no bases for Herrera's statements.<lb/>
There is nothing in this account, then, which throws any light on the<lb/>
existence or non-existence of yellow fever on this coast, either before or<lb/>
after the Conquest.</p>
<p>REPUTATION FROM OTHER SOURCES</p>
<p>Whether the mortality shown to exist at Vera Cruz soon after the<lb/>
Conquest by the following quotations, given by Finlay (1912, pp. 120-<lb/>
121) from a publication (<hi rend="italic">Cartas de las Indias</hi> LXXIII) not accessible to<lb/>
the writer, is greater than is reasonably explicable by malaria, dysentery,<lb/>
and tropical conditions generally among newly arrived Europeans, or<lb/>
implies the prevalence of a more deadly disease, the reader must judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of those who come to San Juan de Lua when, on account of finding<lb/>
no shelter, they are forced to go to the City of Vera Cruz to cure the<lb/>
sicknesses which they have accumulated from Ocoa&rdquo; (Was this the Ocoa<lb/>
in Honduras?) &ldquo;to the port, many die because they go to seek health in<lb/> 
an unhealthful place and where even those who arrive there sound are<lb/>
accustomed to lose it&rdquo; (Letter from the Viceroy Enriquez to Charles<lb/>
V, 1572, asking a hospital at Vera Cruz).</p>
<p>Bishop Marroq&iacute;un of Guatemala, to the Emperor, in 1537: &ldquo;For the<lb/>
love of God order to provide the same&rdquo; (a hospital at the port of entry)<lb/>
&ldquo;in New Spain. There is no year in which 500 men do not die in the<lb/>
port of Vera Cruz, and in the inns and roads a large number.&ldquo; It is<lb/>
fair to say that the same plea was made by the last petitioner in this<lb/>
same letter for a hospital and medical service at Callao, the port of entry<lb/>
of Peru, where we know there was no yellow fever.</p>
<p>To the writer, sufficient mortality is implied for the sickness to have<lb/>
been yellow fever, but not more than could be reasonably explained<lb/>
<pb n="114" id="Cb000128"/>

without it, allowing for some exaggeration from the good Bishop and the<lb/>
desire to show the need of a hospital.</p>
<p>SICKNESS DURING OCCUPATION BY CORTEZ</p>
<p>This region, Vera Cruz and its environment, was apparently not<lb/>
found unhealthful by the Spaniards who came here with Cortez in 1519,<lb/>
or by the garrison which he left there when he went on to Mexico.<lb/>
Cortez landed there April 22, 1519, on Good Friday, whence its name<lb/>
Vera Cruz, and remained there and at Cempoalla, a large city close by,<lb/>
until August 19. Not only do the historians<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> of the expedition fail to<lb/>
mention any serious sickness among the 550 Spaniards landed there--<lb/>
450 soldiers and about 110 sailors, according to Bernal Diaz--but when<lb/>
many of his men were clamoring to return to Cuba--to prevent which he<lb/>
destroyed his ships--the unhealthfulness of the place was not among the<lb/>
reasons alleged by the mutineers for wishing to leave it. They did allege<lb/>
the long and difficult march necessary to reach the City of Mexico, and<lb/>
especially the report of the power and the organization of the empire<lb/>
Cortez purposed to attack, but not one word about sickness,<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> or that the<lb/>
location was unhealthful. Seeking cause of complaint against remain-<lb/>
ing, they would surely have alleged this, an entirely sufficient one, had<lb/>
it existed.</p>
<p>A number of minor incidents are related as happening here, among<lb/>
them the death of Cortez' horse and his purchase of another named &ldquo;El<lb/>
Harriero,&rdquo; a dark chestnut, &ldquo;from Ortiz the Musician and Bartolom&eacute;<lb/>
Garcia, the Miner;&rdquo; the annoyed embarrassment of Escalante, to whom,<lb/>
as a god, incense was offered when he went to the temple; and the prac-<lb/>
tical joke that Cortez perpetrated on &ldquo;old Heridia, the Basque,&rdquo; said<lb/>
to be the ugliest among the Spaniards. Our chroniclers seem to have had<lb/>
plenty of both time and space at their disposal, and surely the occurrence<lb/>
of a serious sickness had not failed of mention.</p>
<p>Note, too, that the time, April 22 to August 19, was during the sickly<lb/>
season of Vera Cruz, and that during most of this time the Spaniards<lb/>
were associated with a large native community,<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> in which we would<lb/>
expect to find yellow fever if it were anywhere in this region.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Bernal Diaz del Castillo, and Gomara, who would give Cortez' account.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Except to state that &ldquo;the few soldiers that we were, and they sick and fed up<lb/>
with marching from place to place&rdquo;: &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tan pocos soldados como Eramos E que Ellos<lb/>
estevan dolientes y hartos de andar de una parte &agrave; otra</hi>&rdquo; (Diaz, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, vol. 1,<lb/>
p. 141).</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> Cempoalla is given from 20,000 to 30,000 population by Las Casas, and Tor-<lb/>
quemada agrees.</p>
<pb n="115" id="Cb000129"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
115</p>
<p>The only complaint recorded of the locality is that made by Bernal<lb/>
Diaz himself: &ldquo;It did not happen as he&rdquo; (Gomara) &ldquo;said; for what<lb/>
kind of people are we Spaniards not to go forward and to remain in<lb/>
regions in which we do not have profit&rdquo; (plunder) &ldquo;and wars&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>,<lb/>
vol. i, p. 166).</p>
<p>Later, after the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Noche Triste</hi>,&rdquo; July 10,1520, Caballero, the admiral<lb/>
whom Cortez left in command of the small force at Villa Rica (Vera<lb/>
Cruz), both that ashore and that afloat (in the captured vessels of Nar-<lb/>
vaez), did report that he had not many mariners fit for duty; that &ldquo;some<lb/>
were sick and some had died.&rdquo; But as of the seven who accompanied<lb/>
Lencero &ldquo;five were full of buboes and two were swelled with great<lb/>
bellies,&rdquo; it would seem that this garrison gives no evidence of yellow<lb/>
fever among them. Some of them had been at Vera Cruz over a year,<lb/>
and all a long time.</p>
<p>Cortez' men had come from Cuba, which at that time, and for more<lb/>
than one hundred years later, is believed to have been free from yellow<lb/>
fever (Finlay, 1912). However, a number, possibly a majority, had<lb/>
come via Hispaniola and other Spanish settlements in the Caribbean<lb/>
of which we cannot (at present) so certainly say this; and it is claimed<lb/>
by Finlay (1912) that they had developed yellow fever in these settle-<lb/>
ments and were therefore immune to further attack. That <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, including<lb/>
the crews of the vessels destroyed and captured, should have been so<lb/>
immunized, or so many of them that yellow fever in the remainder<lb/>
would not have been noticed, seems to me highly improbable.</p>
<p>The death rate of yellow fever, in the conditions under which these men<lb/>
were living, is high, and even a small number of cases of that disease<lb/>
among them would have caused deaths enough to have been noted. I<lb/>
think we may safely claim that there is no evidence of yellow fever<lb/>
among the Conquistadores at Vera Cruz and that the negative evidence<lb/>
is strong that there was none.</p>

<head>THE MAYA COUNTRY: CULTURE; RECORDS OF PESTILENCES (MAYA<lb/>
ClMLAL AND XEKIK)</head>
<pb n="116" id="Cb000130"/>
<p>Of the Maya country, it is the lowlands-Yucatan, Campeche, and the<lb/>
low-lying parts of Guatemala--that are in question. Here the tempera-<lb/>
ture is such that <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> would be active at all seasons, and there was a<lb/> 
large and dense population-large enough and dense enough, one would<lb/>
think, to provide against the elimination of yellow fever by failure of<lb/>
the human host. The storage of water for domestic use in Yucatan<lb/>
must have been always general. Much of the country is limestone<lb/>
(coral); and streams, except underground, are rare. Their old <hi rend="italic">chultunes</hi>,<lb/>
we believe, were used for water storage, although it is possible that some<lb/>
of them may have been used for the storing of grain. They would<lb/>
certainly have been ideal breeding places for <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>. Obviously, both<lb/>
physical and sociological conditions were well suited for a <hi rend="italic">permanent<lb/>
endemic regional focus</hi> of yellow fever. On the other hand, on account<lb/>
of the rarity of water above ground, save in artificial containers, Yucatan<lb/> 
should have been to a great extent free from <hi rend="italic">Anopheles</hi> and hence free<lb/>
from malaria, even after the advent of Spanish and negro carriers.<lb/>
Documents of the sixteenth century (1580 and later) confirm this.</p>
<p>Naturally, in a permanent endemic focus yellow fever would be<lb/>
little apt to be noted in native records, except as epidemics among aggre-<lb/>
gations of susceptible people coming into the country. Such occasions<lb/>
for epidemics might have occurred when Mexicans from the uplands<lb/>
visited the country, whether for war or commerce, which they did from<lb/>
time to time before the Spanish came,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> and in a sufficiently developed<lb/>
historical record the epidemics would probably be noted if of great<lb/>
severity.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> For more than two centuries before the coming of the Spaniards, Aztec mer- <lb/>
cenaries are said to have been employed at Chichen Itza and Mayapan (Morley,<lb/>
1915, pp. 5-6, quoting Landa and others); and, as indicating commercial inter-<lb/>
course, Brinton (1882, p. 23) says that the attack of the Aztecs on the Huastecs in<lb/>
the reign of Montezuma the First was made for the alleged reason that the Huas-<lb/>
tecs had robbed and killed Aztec merchants on their way to the great fairs in<lb/>
Guatemala.</p>
<p>116</p>
<pb n="117" id="Cb000131"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
117</p>
<p>EARLY MAYA CULTURE AND RECORDS</p>
<p>The culture of the Mayas prior to the Conquest was easily the highest<lb/>
of any of the American peoples. The Mexicans, as we have seen, had a<lb/>
system of hieroglyphic writing, somewhat conventionalized; and toward<lb/>
the latter part of their empire, when they wished to indicate the names<lb/>
of men or of places (compounded usually of several sounds), these<lb/>
pictorial signs frequently were used to represent these <hi rend="italic">sounds</hi> instead of<lb/>
ideas. That is, the sign was used for the <hi rend="italic">name</hi>, or some part of the<lb/>
name, of the object represented, and not for the <hi rend="italic">object</hi> itself, the writing<lb/>
being then practically what we now call a &ldquo;rebus.&rdquo; Thus, an ocelot<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">(tehuan)</hi> on a steep hill or rock <hi rend="italic">(tepec)</hi>, instead of representing what was<lb/>
shown, was read &ldquo;the Kingdom of Tehuantepec.&rdquo; They were thus<lb/>
on the road, maybe only at the beginning of it, to the use of characters<lb/>
representing sounds only--that is, to a phonetic alphabet.</p>
<p>The Mayas also used a system of ideographs for writing. Their<lb/>
system, however, was much more developed and much more highly con-<lb/>
ventionalized than that of the Aztecs. Indeed, while almost any one<lb/>
can, to an extent, get the meaning of an Aztec record, few of the original<lb/>
Maya inscriptions have as yet been deciphered, except such as relate to<lb/>
their chronology. The opinion of Mayan scholars is that the use of the<lb/>
Mayan system of signs for writing (Bishop Landa to the contrary, we<lb/>
dare not call them &ldquo;letters&rdquo;) was well advanced into what we may call<lb/>
the &ldquo;rebus system of writing,&rdquo; and possibly may have been occasionally<lb/>
used even more phonetically in word building. Judging from the his-<lb/>
tory of our own alphabet, this seems to be one of the stages naturally<lb/>
occurring in the evolution of a truly phonetic alphabet from ideographs.</p>
<p>In this system the Maya records were kept. Of those written in the<lb/>
original hieroglyphics we have numerous inscriptions on monuments,<lb/>
buildings, tablets, and objects of art, and a very few manuscripts.<lb/>
Many more of the latter, some on a sort of paper and some on deerskin<lb/>
parchment, are known to have existed at the time of the Conquest, but<lb/>
have been either lost or destroyed. In the great <hi rend="italic">auto-da-f&eacute;</hi> at Mani,<lb/>
in 1562, Bishop Landa destroyed, among other things, twenty-seven<lb/>
rolls of manuscripts on deerskin (Brinton, 1882, p. 65). The hiero-<lb/>
glyphic writings that have been preserved are mostly undeciphered<lb/>
except as they relate to records of time, and it is still a question how<lb/>
much of history they may reveal when more fully deciphered.</p>
<p>In addition to these we have a certain number of manuscripts written<lb/>
after the Conquest, by Maya scholars, in the Maya tongue, but in<lb/>
Roman characters. Like the picture-writings of the Aztecs, these<lb/>
<pb n="118" id="Cb000132"/>
118<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
records claim to give the history of the Mayas from very early times.<lb/>
The earliest date given for an alleged historical event, the date of leav-<lb/>
ing Tulapan, is <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 8 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>, of a certain cycle, which Morley (1920, p.<lb/>
499) places within the 20 years ending 176 A.D. This, however, is not the<lb/>
zero point of Maya chronology, which is extended back to great antiquity.<lb/>
Again like the Nahuatl records, those of the Mayas were kept to some<lb/>
extent during and after the Conquest-one of them certainly to beyond<lb/>
1648-the disturbing social effect of the Conquest being decidedly less<lb/>
than in Mexico. This was especially the case in districts like those<lb/>
ruled by the Xius and the Pechs, who were consistently friendly to the<lb/>
Spaniards. Ix Nakuk Pech, of the family from which Campeche was<lb/>
named, who, when he &ldquo;entered the water and received baptism,&rdquo; was<lb/>
called &ldquo;Don Pablo Pech&rdquo; and given the title of &ldquo;Hidalgo and Conquis-<lb/>
tador,&rdquo; continued to rule his father's province and bequeathed it to his<lb/>
son.</p>
<p>As shown by the records which have been deciphered, the Mayas had<lb/>
an elaborate and exact, but rather complicated, system of chronology.<lb/>
Without going into its complexities, we need to refer to only two units of<lb/> 
time used in the documents that we shall quote. These periods, based on<lb/>
the day (<hi rend="italic">kin</hi>) as a fundamental unit, are: the <hi rend="italic">tun</hi> of 360 days, and the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">katun</hi>, of 20 <hi rend="italic">tuns</hi> or 7,200 days--nearly 20 (19.713) of our years.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The<lb/>
&ldquo;Sequence of Katuns,&rdquo; or &ldquo;small cycle&rdquo; as we may call it, comprised 13<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">katuns</hi>, approximately 256 of our years. In this &ldquo;cycle&rdquo; each <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> was<lb/>
named for the day <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> with which it ended, the ending-day being<lb/>
designated by a number, as 1 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>, 2 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>, etc., and the <hi rend="italic">katuns</hi> known<lb/>
accordingly as <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">Ahau, katun</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">Ahau . . . . katun</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>. How-<lb/>
ever, the <hi rend="italic">katuns</hi>, in their sequence, did not follow each other in straight<lb/>
numerical order, 1, 2, 3 . . . . 13; but, owing to the way in which days<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> fell, the order of the <hi rend="italic">katuns</hi>, beginning, say, (arbitrarily) with<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>, was: 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, then returning</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> In addition to the <hi rend="italic">kin</hi> (day), <hi rend="italic">tun</hi> (the primitive meaning of which is stone,<lb/>
rather than year), and <hi rend="italic">katun</hi>, the Mayas used a <hi rend="italic">uinal</hi> (month) of 20 days, and a<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">haab</hi>, or year of 365 days-18 &ldquo;months&rdquo; plus five &ldquo;nameless days&rdquo;--which had<lb/>
names, indeed, but were counted in no month. The <hi rend="italic">haab</hi>, however, is not the basis<lb/>
of record on their monuments, the object of such record being, apparently, to<lb/>
mark the number of <hi rend="italic">days</hi> which had elapsed from their zero day. Their chron-<lb/>
ology was based on the revolution of the earth on its axis, as ours is on its revolu-<lb/>
tion around the sun.</p>
<p>The cycle which fits into the &ldquo;great cycle&rdquo; is of 20 <hi rend="italic">katuns</hi>. What we refer to as<lb/>
a &ldquo;cycle&rdquo; of 13 <hi rend="italic">katuns</hi> is more properly the &ldquo;Sequence of the Katuns&rdquo; or <hi rend="italic">u kahlay<lb/>
katunob</hi> (Morley, 1915, pp. 37-86).</p>
<pb n="119" id="Cb000133"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
119</p>
<p>to 13 and repeating in the same order. Thus, a <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> of any given<lb/>
number <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> recurred at intervals of (approximately) 256 years.</p>
<p>The recording of time among the Mayas was intimately related to<lb/>
their religious ceremonies and priest-craft--cultivated more for this,<lb/>
perhaps, than for the record of historical events. Thus we find that<lb/>
though they were able to fix time accurately to the very day, they were<lb/>
usually satisfied, in their chronicles, with recording the <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> in which<lb/>
an event took place. It is rare that even the <hi rend="italic">tun</hi> in the katun is speci-<lb/>
fied; and where this is recorded in more than one chronicle, there are not<lb/>
infrequently discrepancies between them. If these records are a fair<lb/>
sample, the Mayas paid more attention to the record of <hi rend="italic">time</hi> than to that<lb/>
of events, reversing what we have found to be true of many of the<lb/>
Spanish records of this period.</p>
<p>The Maya records in Roman script that are known are placed by Brin-<lb/>
ton in two classes: (1) official documents, &ldquo;titles to the municipal lands,<lb/>
the record of surveys, etc.,&rdquo; and (2) the &ldquo;Books of Chilan (or Chilam)<lb/>
Balam.&rdquo; &ldquo;Chilan Balam&rdquo; was the designation of a class of priests, and<lb/>
the different &ldquo;Books of Chilan Balam&rdquo; are distinguished by the names<lb/>
of the villages from which they came, as &ldquo;The Book of Chilan Balam of<lb/>
Mani,&rdquo; &ldquo;of Tizimin,&rdquo; etc. Those that are known are devoted partly to<lb/>
the recital of the sequence of <hi rend="italic">katuns</hi>, with mention of events of history;<lb/>
partly to ritual predictions of future events. These prophecies are<lb/>
especially of calamities which will befall, usually at the &ldquo;doubling of the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">katun</hi>,&rdquo; that is, at the recurrence of a <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> of the same number <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>,<lb/>
256 years later.</p>
<p>Brinton (1882), in his <hi rend="italic">Maya Chronicles</hi>, gives the original Maya<lb/>
text and translations into English of the historical portions of three<lb/>
&ldquo;Books of Chilan Balam:&rdquo; those of &ldquo;Mani,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tizimin,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chu-<lb/>
mayel.&rdquo; From the last-named he gives two separate chronicles, and a<lb/>
third extract which is not counted as historical, but is a sort of ritual<lb/>
chant.</p>
<p>The manuscripts from which these are taken are said by Brinton (p.<lb/>
70) to be probably &ldquo;all copies of older manuscripts, with merely the<lb/>
occasional addition of current items of note.&rdquo; That they actually are<lb/>
copies of written records, seems, however, not to be assured, for in another<lb/>
passage (p. 68) Brinton says of their authors: &ldquo;Relying on their memo-<lb/>
ries, and no doubt aided by some of the ancient hieroglyphical manu-<lb/>
scripts, carefully secreted from the vandalism of the monks, they wrote<lb/>
out what they could recollect of their national literature.&rdquo; Later,<lb/>
commenting on the similarities and discrepancies between the different<lb/>
<pb n="120" id="Cb000134"/>
120<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
chronicles, he says (p. 82): &ldquo;This similarity may be explained by two<lb/>
suppositions; either they are copies from a common original, or they<lb/>
present the facts they narrate in general formulae which had been widely<lb/>
adopted by the priests for committing to memory their ancient history.<lb/>
The differences which we find in them preclude the former hypothesis<lb/>
except as it may apply to the first two&rdquo; (the Books of Chilan Balam of<lb/>
Mani and Tizimin). &ldquo;The similarities in the others I believe are no<lb/>
more than would occur in relating the same incidents which had been<lb/>
learned through fixed forms of narration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The record of events is scant--the whole of the four chronicles<lb/>
occupy less than 20 octavo pages--with intervals sometimes of more<lb/>
than a hundred years between events noted, and with many irregulari-<lb/>
ties. In such documents we need not expect to find much mention or<lb/>
description of diseases, yet the records do yield some information on our<lb/>
problem.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi></p>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
121</p>
<p>a pestilence in that <hi rend="italic">katun</hi>: more definitely placed by one of them (p. 171)<lb/>
as in the fifth <hi rend="italic">tun</hi> of that <hi rend="italic">katun</hi>. The end of the previous <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> is placed<lb/>
by Morley (1920), who has gone critically into the correlation of Chris-<lb/>
tian and Mayan chronology, as 1477, about the end of November.<lb/>
According to this chronology this epidemic should have occurred, then,<lb/>
in 1482 or 1483. According to the chronology of Landa, with whom<lb/>
Martinez Hernandez (personal communication) agrees, it is placed in<lb/>
1485 (Landa, 1864, pp. 52 and 62).</p>
<p>The original and the literal translation of one of these texts, from the<lb/>
&ldquo;Book of Chilan Balam of Tizimin&rdquo;--practically identical with that from<lb/>
the first chronicle of the &ldquo;Book of Chilan Balam of Chumayel&rdquo;--is here<lb/>
given (Brinton, 1882, pp. 142 and 148):</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">&ldquo;Can ahau; uchi maya cimlal ocnalkuchil ych paa.&rdquo;</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;The fourth <hi rend="italic">ahau</hi>; the pestilence, the general death, took place in the<lb/>
fortress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">maya cimlal</hi>&rdquo; (or, as written elsewhere, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mayacimil</hi>&rdquo;) mean<lb/>
literally &ldquo;Maya-death&rdquo; (Brinton, p. 132); and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ocnalkuchil</hi>,&rdquo; translated<lb/>
above &ldquo;the general death,&rdquo; means, from its derivation, &ldquo;buzzards enter<lb/>
the houses,&rdquo; on account of the number of deaths (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, p. 151).</p>
<p>Whether the pestilence was general throughout the land is not indi-<lb/>
cated unless by implication. The last words seem to limit it to &ldquo;the<lb/>
fortress.&rdquo; Hitherto in these records this term &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">paa</hi>&rdquo; had only been<lb/>
applied to Mayapan, a large city, the over-lord of the country until it had<lb/>
been &ldquo;depopulated&rdquo; (destroyed or abandoned) by a civil war in <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 8<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>, (about 1438-1458 A.D.). Possibly it was not entirely destroyed<lb/>
at that time, or the Maya-death may have been in some other fortress to<lb/>
which the Mayapan people had moved.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi></p>
<p>The manuscript of Mani, which Brinton thinks (pp. 82 and 136) is<lb/>
closely related in its origin to that of Tizimin, mentions no pestilence in<lb/>
this <hi rend="italic">katun</hi>, but gives:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">buluc ahau uchci mayacimil ich paa yetel nohkakil:</hi>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eleventh <hi rend="italic">ahau</hi> took place the pestilence in the fortress and the<lb/>
smallpox&rdquo; (Brinton, 1882, pp. 98 and 103).</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Dr. Martinez Hernandez of Merida says (personal communication) that this<lb/>
term &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ich paa</hi>,&rdquo; translated by Brinton as &ldquo;in the fortress,&rdquo; is &ldquo;the name given to<lb/>
the population of Mayapan living <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> the stone wall surrounding the capital<lb/>
of the Maya Confederation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Izamal and Mani, founded after the destruction of<lb/>
Mayapan, had no walls.&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Ich paa</hi> and Mayapan are synonomous.&rdquo; &ldquo;The pesti-<lb/>
lence refers to an existing condition in Mayapan.&rdquo; This would limit the pestilence<lb/>
to what was left of Mayapan.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>Here the &ldquo;pestilence in the fortress&rdquo; is placed between the years 1536<lb/>
and 1556, that is, during the period of the Spanish Conquest, and 40 to<lb/>
80 years later than the date given by the other three records.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> Here too,<lb/>
smallpox,<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> though seemingly differentiated from &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mayacimil</hi>&rdquo; by the<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">yetel</hi>&rdquo; (&ldquo;and&rdquo;), is associated with it in time.</p>
<p>There are similar discrepancies between the different chronicles in<lb/>
their records of smallpox--the only disease other than &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mayacimil</hi>,&rdquo;<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ocnalkuchil</hi>,&rdquo; that they mention.</p>
<p>The manuscript of Mani, as we have seen, notes smallpox first in<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 11 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> (1536-1556), and later records it in 1609, giving the year<lb/> 
A. D. The Tizimin also mentions smallpox twice: first in <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi><lb/>
(1497-1517) and again in 1569. The latter entry is evidently meant<lb/>
to correspond to the 1609 given by the Mani manuscript, for in all<lb/>
other dates given in Christian chronology, from 1536 to 1611, these two<lb/> 
documents agree. The first of the Chronicles of Chumayel agrees with<lb/>
the Tizimin in mentioning smallpox (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">kakil nohkakile</hi>&rdquo;) first in <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 2<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> (1497-1517), and says, in the record of <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 11 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> (1536-<lb/>
1556): &ldquo;mighty men came from the East&rdquo; (Spaniards) &ldquo;they brought<lb/>
the sickness.&rdquo; Brinton (p. 164) thinks this was probably smallpox,</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> According to the correlation of Maya and Christian chronology given by Mor-<lb/>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>

<p>though without its distinctive name. If so, this agrees with the record<lb/>
which the Mani chronicle gives of smallpox in this <hi rend="italic">katun</hi>. The fourth<lb/>
of our sources, the second of the Chronicles from Chumayel, does not<lb/>
mention smallpox at all. We may note, too, that of the three which do<lb/>
mention it, not one of them agrees with the record from European<lb/>
sources, according to which smallpox was introduced into Cozumel in<lb/>
1520 by Narvaez.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi></p>
<p>In the only passage where smallpox and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mayacimil</hi>&rdquo; are mentioned<lb/>
together, that is, in <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 11 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> (1536-1556), by the Mani manuscript<lb/>
(Brinton, pp. 98 and 103), they seem to be differentiated by the text:<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mayacimil</hi> in the fortress and (&lsquo;yetel&rsquo;) smallpox.&rdquo; Yet one wonders<lb/>
whether, in spite of the &ldquo;and,&rdquo; the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mayacimil</hi>&rdquo; of this <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> were not<lb/>
itself smallpox. It may even be a question whether the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mayacimil</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> may not have been smallpox, misplaced in the time<lb/>
of its occurrence. That events prior to the Spanish Conquest were<lb/>
rather frequently misplaced in these records is admitted. However, we<lb/>
think the evidence here is decidedly in favor of a pestilence (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">maya-<lb/>
cimil</hi>&rdquo;) other than smallpox having actually occurred in <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>,<lb/>
that is, between 1477 and 1500 A.D., taking Morley's chronology for the<lb/>
beginning and Landa's for the ending of this <hi rend="italic">katun</hi>. We have, indeed,<lb/>
independent evidence of this from European record of Maya tradition<lb/>
current in the time of the Conquest.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> The writer has noted two systems connecting the Mayan and Christian chron-<lb/>
ologies: that by Bishop Landa (1864) and that given by Morley (1915 and 1920).<lb/>
These, about this period, differ by about two and a quarter years. Thus, the date<lb/>
in our calendar corresponding to the 5th <hi rend="italic">tun</hi> of <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> of a certain cycle is<lb/>
given by Morley as 1482 or 1483; from Landa it would be 1485.</p>
<p>As Morley has the information Landa gave for his own determination, and in<lb/>
addition all that has become available since (and much work has been done in<lb/>
Maya chronology in the last 100 years), his determination should be the more<lb/>
accurate; and from examination of his data and arguments, the writer so regards<lb/>
it. Yet the first record, in the manuscripts of Tizimin and of Chumayel, of the<lb/>
appearance of smallpox among the Mayas is given as in <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>. This ends,<lb/>
according to Morley, in 1517: according to Landa, in 1520. The latter would agree<lb/>
with its introduction in 1520 by Narvaez at Cozumel.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot be absolutely positive that this was its first introduction,<lb/>
but we have no <hi rend="italic">European</hi> evidence of smallpox in either Yucatan, Mexico, or<lb/>
Central America before that date or--unless we take these passages with Morley's<lb/>
chronology as being such--in any Maya or Nahuatl records that I have seen, and it<lb/>
seems unlikely, had such a thing occurred, that it had not been noted. Also, the<lb/>
Cozumel epidemic of 1520 was evidently in a virgin population in that section.</p>
<p>The foregoing is evidently, then, evidence, as far as it goes, in favor of Landa's<lb/>
chronology as compared with Morley's.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>Of the nature of the sickness called &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mayacimil</hi>,&rdquo; the writer can find no<lb/>
description whatever in these chronicles or in any other historical docu-<lb/>
ment of the Mayas<hi rend="superscript">8</hi>--not even such descriptive name as we had in the<lb/>
word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">matlazahuatl</hi>&rdquo; for the Mexican pestilences of 1544 and 1576.<lb/>
Such Maya scholars as I have interrogated personally or by letter believe<lb/>
that no such description exists in the Maya records. It is simply &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">maya<lb/>
cimlal</hi>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Maya-death&rdquo;), a deadly pestilence; the name showing the<lb/>
gravity of the sickness, and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ocnalkuchil</hi>&rdquo; (&ldquo;buzzards-in-the-houses&rdquo;)<lb/>
to express that it was a great epidemic independently of the nature of<lb/>
the sickness--about equivalent apparently to the word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">cocoliztle</hi>&rdquo; in<lb/>
Nahuatl.</p>
<p>We have, indeed, from two Europeans, quoting Maya tradition, ac-<lb/>
counts of great sicknesses occurring before the Conquest. One of these<lb/>
is by Bishop Landa, written probably about 1565 (Morley, 1915, p 7);<lb/>
the other is by Benzoni, quoting a Maya <hi rend="italic">cacique</hi> about 1541 or 1542.<lb/>
Both of these accounts were written close enough to the time of occur-<lb/>
rence (about 1485) of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">maya cimlal</hi>&rdquo; to be of value.</p>
<p>However, we can better discuss these later; and leaving them for the<lb/>
present, let us first examine the passages in the Maya manuscripts where<lb/>
the word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>&rdquo; (blood-vomit) occurs.</p>
<p>REFERENCES IN THE MAYA RECORDS TO XEKIK (BLOOD-VOMIT)</p>
<p>In two of the Maya manuscripts that have been quoted, the &ldquo;Book of<lb/>
Chilan Balam of Tizimin&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Book of Chilan Balam of Chumayel&rdquo;<lb/>
--but in portions not included in Brinton's <hi rend="italic">Maya Chronicles</hi>--there are<lb/>
passages containing the word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>,&rdquo; which, from its meaning (blood-<lb/>
vomit) and the context in which it occurs, is evidently the designation<lb/>
of a fatal epidemic disease characterized by the vomiting of blood.</p>
<p>So far as the writer knows, the first to call attention to these passages<lb/>
and to relate them to the history of yellow fever was Bishop Crescencio<lb/>
Carillo y Ancona of Merida, a distinguished Yucatecan scholar who, at</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">8</hi> The Chronicle of Chac Xulub Chen (Brinton, 1882, pp. 189-259), written about<lb/>
1562 by Nakuk Pech, the hereditary ruler of this district, is historical for the time<lb/>
it covers, and is probably the most reliable record that we have. It is a contempo-<lb/>
rary account by an intelligent and educated man of high position before and after<lb/>
the Conquest. It is especially valuable for its chronological data, stating that a<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">katun</hi> ended in the year 1517, and giving other dates which Morley (1920, p. 468<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>) considers important for the correlation of Maya with Christian chronol-<lb/> 
ogy. The document covers, however, only from 1511 to about 1562, the early part<lb/>
being from the reports of others. There is no mention of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">maya cimlal</hi>&rdquo; or 
of smallpox in it.</p>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
125</p>
<p>the time, possessed the original Tizimin and Chumayel manuscripts.<lb/>
Finlay, noting the reference to &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>&rdquo; in one of the Bishop's publica-<lb/>
tions, wrote to him and received in reply a letter giving further informa-<lb/>
tion and an additional citation from the manuscript. This letter is<lb/>
quoted at length by Finlay (1912, pp. 211-219) in his paper,<hi rend="superscript">9</hi> which<lb/>
interprets the passages as giving strong evidence that the Mayas had<lb/>
ancient knowledge of yellow fever.</p>
<p>We will quote the original Maya text and translations of four passages<lb/>
from the manuscripts of Chumayel and Tizimin, including the two which<lb/>
Finlay gives in his paper.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Quotation I</hi></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel&rdquo; (Gordon's photostat, Phila-<lb/>
delphia, 1913, plate 63) gives:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">uchci xekik hoppci cimil toon dzo 1648 a&ntilde;os</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Translation: &ldquo;Occurred blood-vomit began death to our people the<lb/>
year 1648.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, which is the first passage quoted by Finlay, is obviously an his-<lb/>
torical record, and refers to a time more than a hundred years after the<lb/>
Conquest. It is quoted here as showing: (1) that this epidemic was<lb/>
recorded when it occurred, and (2) that &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>&rdquo; was the name the Maya<lb/>
used to describe the sickness which we are sure, in this instance, was<lb/>
yellow fever--the epidemic of 1648 being historical.<hi rend="superscript">10</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">9</hi> This paper, entitled &ldquo;Yellow Fever, Before and After the Discovery of<lb/>
America,&rdquo; is included in Finlay's <hi rend="italic">Trabajos Selectos</hi> (1912) as a reprint from <hi rend="italic">The<lb/>
Climatologist</hi>, Philadelphia, July, 1892.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">10</hi> Of course &ldquo;black vomit,&rdquo; which gave the Spanish name to yellow fever and<lb/>
which is its most readily noted characteristic, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the vomiting of blood. Its ap-<lb/>
pearance, however, save in the (usually rare) fulminant cases, does not suggest<lb/>
blood and, in fact, was not recognized as such by European physicians until 1738,<lb/>
by Henry Warren. Nevertheless, in the great early epidemics which occurred in<lb/>
the Americas (1648 in Yucatan and the French Antilles; 1686 in Bahia), &ldquo;the<lb/>
bringing up of blood&rdquo;--&ldquo;the discharge of blood from the mouth&rdquo;--was recognized<lb/>
by those who described it. I think, then, that &ldquo;blood-vomit&rdquo; would have been<lb/>
naturally used by the Mayas as a designation of a <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> epidemic of yellow fever.</p>
<p>Bishop Carillo y Ancona of Yucatan, in his letter to Dr. Finlay (Finlay, 1912,<lb/>
p. 216), quotes what we have just given and makes an argument for knowledge of<lb/>
yellow fever by the Mayas <hi rend="italic">prior to</hi> 1648 because they <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> gave a name (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>&rdquo;)<lb/>
to it in their records for this year. The same argument would hold for smallpox,<lb/>
which was, however, recorded as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">nohkakil</hi>&rdquo; (&ldquo;great-fire&rdquo;) when it first appeared<lb/>
among them in 1520. A name, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tohtomonalitzli</hi>&rdquo;--to have pustules--was also<lb/>
given to smallpox by the Mexicans when it first appeared among them. This<lb/>
name occurs in the entry for the year 1520.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Quotation II</hi></p>
<p>To Dr. Juan Martinez Hernandez,<hi rend="superscript">11</hi> of Merida, Yucatan, (personal com-<lb/>
munication of July 13, 1922) the writer is indebted for the following ex-<lb/>
tract from the &ldquo;Book of Chilam Balam of Tizimin&rdquo; (MS. folio 15, p. 29):</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik, u cuch katun te tu uich can ahau katun vale, uchci maya-cimlal<lb/>
ocnal-kuchil, bay bin uchpahal tu vuudz tu caten, ti cu tal tu cuch-habil,<lb/>
bay yalci ahkin chilan tu cuch-katun can ahau vale</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is translated by Dr. Martinez Hernandez as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;blood-vomit is the outcome&rsquo; (burden) &lsquo;of the <hi rend="italic">katun</hi>, in the transcourse<lb/>
of the <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> four <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>, probably, took place&rsquo; (the calamity or pestilence<lb/>
called) <hi rend="italic">&lsquo;maya cimlal&rsquo;</hi> (the pestilence of the Mayas) &lsquo;and <hi rend="italic">ocnal-kuchil&rsquo;</hi> (when<lb/>
so many died that the buzzards entered the houses to eat the corpses:<lb/>
such statement was made by the High Priest); &lsquo;so it will again take place,<lb/>
when it turns again, it is indicated in the course of the yearly events, as<lb/>
was predicted by the High Priest, as the coming events in the course of<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> four <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>, probably.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is clearly a prediction, rather than an historical record. The<lb/>
expression &ldquo;when it turns again (<hi rend="italic">vuudz</hi>)&rdquo; refers to the doubling of the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">katuns</hi>, in this case when <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> returns in the count of the <hi rend="italic">katuns</hi>.<lb/> 
The words &ldquo;so it will again take place when it turns again (<hi rend="italic">bay bin<lb/>
uchpahal tu vuudz</hi>)&rdquo; are especially to be noted for comparison with<lb/>
phrases which occur in Quotations III and IV. This quotation predicts<lb/>
a return of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">maya-cimlal</hi>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ocnal-kuchil</hi>&rdquo;--that is, &ldquo;Maya-death,&rdquo;<lb/>
&ldquo;great epidemic&rdquo;--during the next <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>, which should run<lb/>
from about 1733 to 1753, and that <hi rend="italic">xekik</hi> will occur at the same time. The<lb/>
direct statement as to the past is that &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">maya-cimlal</hi>&rdquo; and &ldquo;ocnal-kuchil&rdquo;<lb/>
occurred (<hi rend="italic">uchci</hi>) in <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>. This does not seem to be directly<lb/>
stated of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik,</hi>&rdquo;though such may be the intent of the phrase &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik u<lb/>
cuch katun</hi>,&rdquo; which Dr. Martinez Hernandez translates literally &ldquo;blood-<lb/>
vomit is the burden of the katun.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Quotation III</hi></p>
<p>The next passage is one of those quoted by Finlay, who received it<lb/>
from Bishop Carillo y Ancona, the source being the Tizimin manuscript<lb/>
(folio 16 (<hi rend="italic">verso</hi>) and 17). Transcripts of the same passage from this<lb/>
manuscript have also been furnished the writer by Dr. Martinez Her-<lb/>
nandez and Dr. Herbert J. Spinden of The Peabody Museum of Harvard<lb/>
University.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">11</hi> I can scarcely adequately express my gratitude to this gentleman for his<lb/>
many courtesies and for the assistance he has given me in this and other matters.</p>
<pb n="127" id="Cb000143"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
127</p>
<p>The passage is:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Can ahau u buluc dzit katun cu xocol tu chichen ytza u hedz katun</hi> ULOM<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">kuk</hi> ULOM <hi rend="italic">yaxum</hi> (p. 33) ULOM <hi rend="italic">ah kantenal</hi> ULOM <hi rend="italic">xekik tu can</hi> UADZ ULOM<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">kukulcan tu pach ah ytzaob, tu</hi> CAN TEN <hi rend="italic">u than katun vale</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For this we will give three translations. The first is by Bishop Carillo<lb/>
y Ancona. The English equivalent of his Spanish translation is given<lb/>
by Finlay (p. 217) as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the fourth ahau (year of the Mayas) at the expiration of a <hi rend="italic">katun<lb/>
(their century)</hi> which is counted towards the well of Chichenitz&aacute;, at the<lb/>
placing of the stone katun, arrival of Kuk, arrival of Yaxum (<hi rend="italic">mythologi-<lb/>
cal and historical characters who gave their names to the epochs</hi>)<hi rend="superscript">12</hi> arrival of<lb/>
Kantenal, OCCURRED<hi rend="superscript">13</hi> THE ARRIVAL OF BLACK VOMIT FOR THE FOURTH<lb/>
TIME, arrival of Kukulcan, after the Ytzaes, at the fourth placing and<lb/>
signification of the katun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Note that the word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ulom</hi>&rdquo; preceding &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">kuk,&rdquo; &ldquo;yaxum,&rdquo; &ldquo;ah kantenal&rdquo;</hi><lb/>
and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">kukulcan</hi>&rdquo;is translated &ldquo;arrival of&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">llegada de</hi>), with no indication<lb/>
of tense, whether past or future; while, as referring to &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik,</hi>&rdquo;it is trans-<lb/>
lated &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">occurred the arrival of&rdquo; (fu&eacute; llegada de) &ldquo;xekik.</hi>&rdquo;This must be<lb/>
considered an &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; rather than a literal translation, for the<lb/>
word &ldquo;occurred&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">uchci</hi>) is not in the Maya text.</p>
<p>The second translation is by Dr. J. Martinez Hernandez (personal<lb/>
communications of April 6, 1922, July 13, 1922, and July 3, 1923), who<lb/>
renders the Maya text, <hi rend="italic">as written</hi>, thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four <hi rend="italic">ahau</hi> the eleventh katun reckoned at Chichen Ytza, it estab-<lb/>
lishes the <hi rend="italic">katun</hi>, will arrive <hi rend="italic">kuk</hi>, will arrive <hi rend="italic">yaxum</hi>, will arrive <hi rend="italic">ah kantenal</hi>,<lb/> 
will arrive <hi rend="italic">xekik</hi> for the fourth time, will arrive <hi rend="italic">kukulcan</hi> with the<lb/>
Ytzas the fourth time according to the <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The material difference between this and the first version is that the<lb/>
word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ulom</hi>&rdquo;translated by Bishop Carillo y Ancona as &ldquo;arrival&rdquo; and<lb/>
given the sense of &ldquo;did arrive,&rdquo; is translated by Dr. Martinez Hernandez<lb/>
as &ldquo;will arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the Maya text itself, which he considers &ldquo;a brief ritualistic recital&rdquo;<lb/>
of Quotation II, he writes: &ldquo;I am afraid that the word <hi rend="italic">&lsquo;uadz&rsquo;</hi> (the fourth</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">12</hi> An examination of Brinton's <hi rend="italic">Names of the Gods in the Kiche Myths of Cen-<lb/>
tral America</hi> (1881), and of his <hi rend="italic">Nagualism</hi> (1894), gives none of the above names<lb/>
except &ldquo;Kukulcan.&rdquo; Recent Maya scholars state that in the early attempts<lb/>
to translate Maya records it was common to consider nouns of which the translator<lb/>
did not know the meaning as names of their gods or legendary heroes.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">13</hi> This word &ldquo;occurred&rdquo; (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">uchci</hi>&rdquo;) is not in the Maya text of which this is a<lb/>
translation.</p>

<p>128<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>time) should be <hi rend="italic">&lsquo;uudz (vuudz)&rsquo;</hi> as in the first instance&rdquo; (Quotation II) &ldquo;no<lb/>
such fourth time of <hi rend="italic">xekik</hi> is mentioned, but <hi rend="italic">&lsquo;uudz,&rsquo;</hi> the doubling or shift-<lb/>
ing movement of the <hi rend="italic">katun.&rdquo;</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Caten</hi> (again) is written twice&rdquo; (Quotations II and IV); &ldquo;it should<lb/>
not be read (here) <hi rend="italic">can ten</hi> (the fourth time), but <hi rend="italic">caten</hi>, twice; again;&rdquo;<lb/>
and he translates Quotation III, thus changed, as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four <hi rend="italic">ahau</hi>, the eleventh <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> reckoned at Chichen Itza, it estab-<lb/>
lishes the <hi rend="italic">katun</hi>; will arrive <hi rend="italic">kuk</hi>, will arrive <hi rend="italic">yaxum</hi>, will arrive <hi rend="italic">ah kantenal</hi>,<lb/>
will arrive <hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>, when it turns again will arrive <hi rend="italic">Kukulcan</hi> with the<lb/>
Itzas again according to the <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> (ritual) probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer, of course, cannot claim to be able to decide between Maya<lb/>
scholars, but as authority for his translation of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ulom</hi>&rdquo;as &ldquo;will come,&rdquo;<lb/>
Dr. Martinez Hernandez cites Father Gabriel de San Buenaventura, who<lb/>
should be authoritative on the old Maya language, having published his<lb/>
grammar of it in 1684, in Mexico. He is very clear as to the signification<lb/>
of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">om</hi>&rdquo;appended to a verbal root--making what he called &ldquo;the future of<lb/>
certainty.&rdquo; He says:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">&ldquo;Om&rdquo;</hi>: with this are made the futures in <hi rend="italic">om</hi>, which come only from<lb/>
verbs of the first conjugation, changing the ultimate <hi rend="italic">&lsquo;i&rsquo;</hi> of the third per-<lb/>
son of the preterite into &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">om</hi>:&rsquo; e.g. <hi rend="italic">cimi</hi>--he died: <hi rend="italic">cimon</hi>--we will die<lb/>
without fail. These futures mean that the action which the verb<lb/>
signifies has to happen without fail.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">14</hi></p>
<p>Dr. Martinez Hernandez writes that this use of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">om</hi>&rdquo; is antiquated,<lb/>
and is given only by Buenaventura; also that &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ulom</hi>,&rdquo; he thinks, does not<lb/>
here express a future of <hi rend="italic">certainty</hi>, but is better translated &ldquo;is to arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sense in which Bishop Carillo y Ancona has interpreted &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">om</hi>&rdquo; is<lb/>
that it indicates &ldquo;us,&rdquo; &ldquo;to us,&rdquo; from which &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ulom</hi>&rdquo; would be &ldquo;arrival to<lb/>
us,&rdquo; and this, as we understand from Dr. Martinez Hernandez, would be<lb/>
the usual rendering, the use of the ending &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">om</hi>&rdquo; to indicate the future<lb/>
being, as he has said, antiquated.</p>
<p>Even independently of the question of grammar involved in the ren-<lb/>
dering of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ulom</hi>&rdquo; reference to the future seems clearly implied (1) by the<lb/>
prophetic character of the whole passage and its relation to the prophecy</p>

<p>in Quotation II; and (2) by the expression &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ulom kukulcan</hi>.&rdquo; Kukulcan,<lb/>
analagous to the Quetzalcoatl of the Mexicans (Brinton, 1882, p. 119),<lb/>
was the legendary hero-god of the Mayas, bearing some such relation to<lb/>
them as Arthur to the Britons or Holgar Danske to the Danes; and his<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">second coming</hi> was looked forward to as the deliverance from their oppres-<lb/>
sors. The arrival of Kukulcan was evidently not meant as a calamity,<lb/>
but was prophesied as a deliverance after a culmination of calamities.<lb/>
It was as evidently to be in the future.</p>
<p>Of more importance for our purposes, is the question raised by Dr.<lb/>
Martinez Hernandez whether the words &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">uadz</hi>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">can ten</hi>,&rdquo; signifying<lb/>
&ldquo;the fourth time&rdquo; are not due to errors in copying the words &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">uudz</hi>&rdquo; and<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">caten</hi>,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;twice.&rdquo; Both Finlay and Bishop Carillo y Ancona,<lb/>
as quoted by him, interpreted this passage as referring to the epidemic<lb/>
of 1648, which is well authenticated as yellow fever, and based their<lb/>
argument for previous knowledge of this disease on the designation of this<lb/>
as its <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> occurrence.<hi rend="superscript">15</hi> That errors in the copying of these manu-<lb/>
scripts were very frequent is noted repeatedly by Brinton, and is indeed<lb/>
obvious enough in the recording of proper names and dates. It is, then,<lb/>
by no means improbable that such errors should have occurred in this<lb/>
text. Also, the corrections suggested by Dr. Martinez Hernandez make<lb/>
a more rational version--if we can judge of what is &ldquo;rational&rdquo; in docu-<lb/>
ments of this character. It seems strange, too, that the Mayas should<lb/>
record the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> occurrence of a particular kind of pestilence when we<lb/>
have no record of its first, second, and third occurrence. The writer is<lb/>
inclined to believe that the words signifying &ldquo;the fourth time&rdquo; are<lb/>
errors. At best they make a doubtful basis for accepting three previous<lb/>
occurrences of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Quotation IV</hi></p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel&rdquo; (Gordon's photostat,<lb/>
plate 99), we find:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">1740. Primero<lb/>

<p>Dr. Martinez Hernandez translates this as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four <hi rend="italic">ahau</hi>, the eleventh <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> reckoned at Chichen Ytza, it estab-</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">15</hi> Both of them believed, however, that this was its <hi rend="italic">first</hi> occurrence since the<lb/>

with them for the second time, by the order of God, will arrive the Itzas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is so nearly identical with Quotation III that, as Dr. Martinez<lb/>
Hernandez says, &ldquo;it seems to be a rough copy of it,&rdquo; or perhaps, as one<lb/>
might surmise, another version of a formula committed to memory.<lb/>
Note that it is dated 1740, and that the Spanish word D<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. (Dios) occurs<lb/>
in the text.</p>
<p>On plate 103 of the Chumayel manuscript (Gordon's photostat) there<lb/>
is again mention of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>.&rdquo; This, with its continuance on plate 104, is<lb/>
so manifestly a prophecy--the high priests are mentioned by name, with<lb/>
the word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">profeciado</hi>&rdquo; attached to each name and to the word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">sacerdote</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
--and is so manifestly written after the Conquest--Latin and Spanish<lb/>
words, some with Maya terminations and some not, being interpolated<lb/>
in the body of the text, and smallpox mentioned as among the calami-<lb/>
ties that were to occur (this time in <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> and <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>)--<lb/>
that discussion of it seems unnecessary. Here the word for smallpox is<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">pomkakil</hi>,&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;gum-copal-fire,&rdquo; or &ldquo;incense fire&rdquo; (gum copal being<lb/>
used for incense in the Maya ritual), a descriptive designation from the<lb/>
kind of burns the sputtering gum would make.</p>
<p>Prophecies though they be, these entries, as we have them, indicate<lb/>
that their authors undoubtedly had knowledge of some pestilence<lb/>
characterized by what they considered vomiting--or it may be the spit-<lb/>
ting--of blood. If either the original or its transcription was written<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">after</hi> the epidemic of yellow fever of 1648, it would be natural that <hi rend="italic">xekik</hi><lb/>
should be given as among the calamities, or as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> calamity predicted,<lb/>
being the gravest the transcribers had experienced. Even if written or<lb/>
copied after the great Mexican epidemics of 1544, 1545, and 1576, so<lb/>
marked by vomiting of blood, the use of this word as a designation of a<lb/>
pestilence predicted would not be surprising, and this even if no disease<lb/>
with this symptom had hitherto occurred among the Mayas. The<lb/>
occurrences and characteristics of the Mexican epidemic would have<lb/>
been known to educated men in Yucatan, and well might have impressed<lb/>
them profoundly as the type of a pestilential calamity. If, however, the<lb/>
paragraph was in its present form <hi rend="italic">prior to 1544</hi>, I think it would be very<lb/>
strong evidence that a disease known as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>&rdquo; (blood-vomit) was<lb/>
known to the Mayas in Yucatan before the advent of the Spaniards.</p>
<p>Now for the dates at which the copies of the records that we have<lb/>
were made. In the Chumayel manuscript, from which our Quotations I<lb/>
and IV are taken, the entries are <hi rend="italic">dated</hi> 1648 and 1740, respectively, so<lb/>
<pb n="131" id="Cb000147"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
131<lb/>
there can be no question that they were written after the historical yellow<lb/>
fever epidemic of 1648. According to Brinton, this manuscript is a copy<lb/>
made in 1782 by an Indian, Don Juan Josef Hoil. Plate 81 of Gor-<lb/>
don's photostat shows his signature, &ldquo;D<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Juan Josef Hoil&rdquo; and the<lb/>
date, January 20, 1782.</p>
<p>The Tizimin manuscript is believed to be of earlier date. Bishop<lb/>
Carillo y Ancona, who owned the original, says in the letter quoted by<lb/>
Finlay (1912, p. 219): &ldquo;Although the quotation from the &lsquo;Tzimin&rsquo; man-<lb/>
uscript does not contain the date (expressed in years of the Christian<lb/>
era) it fortunately happens that the book commences its chronological<lb/>
notes with the year &lsquo;1593&rsquo;, so written in the hand of the Indian author<lb/>
and with the same figures that we now use (folio 1, line 2).&rdquo; That it was<lb/>
either transcribed or added to later is shown by the fact that the last<lb/>
entries in the part translated by Brinton (1882, pp. 143 and 149) are<lb/>
1610<hi rend="superscript">16</hi> and 1611. It may, of course, date from a considerably later<lb/>
period, and it was evidently the opinion of Bishop Carillo y Ancona that it<lb/>
extended beyond 1648, for, as quoted by Finlay (p. 219), he says: &ldquo;to<lb/>
this same year&rdquo; (1648) &ldquo;must correspond that <hi rend="italic">fourth epidemic</hi> mentioned<lb/>
in the &lsquo;Tzimin&rsquo; manuscript, and the three previous ones must have<lb/>
taken place before the year 1593, at which that chronological record<lb/>
begins.&rdquo; The argument which he makes for ancient knowledge of<lb/>
&ldquo;xekik&rdquo; among the Mayas is based not on the antiquity of the document,<lb/>
but on its allusion to the recurrence of &ldquo;xekik&rdquo; for the <hi rend="italic">fourth time</hi>.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that whatever may have been the date of the earliest<lb/>
occurrence of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>,&rdquo; the Maya manuscripts in which we find mention<lb/>
of it were written (or copied) quite certainly after the Mexican epi-<lb/>
demics of 1544 and 1576, which were characterized by the vomiting of<lb/>
blood. Moreover, at least two of the passages--those from the manu-<lb/>
script of Chumayel--are shown to have been, and the other two, so far<lb/>
as we know <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have been, written <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the epidemic of 1648 in Yuca-<lb/>
tan. Hence, the mere fact that &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>&rdquo; is mentioned in these manu-<lb/>
scripts does not, of itself, afford certain evidence that the disease so<lb/>
designated was actually known to the Mayas before 1648.</p>
<p>The three passages which are clearly ritual prophecies (our Quotations<lb/>
II, III, and IV) all refer to a <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>, implying that this <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> is in<lb/>
some way identified with &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>,&rdquo; either as the time when it is alleged<lb/>
to have occurred or when its recurrence is predicted, or both. It is also<lb/>
in a <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>, apparently the one extending from 1477 to 1497, that</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">16</hi> The date printed as 1610 in the translation (p. 149) is printed as 1619 in the<lb/>
Maya text (p. 143).</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>three of the four &ldquo;historical&rdquo; Chronicles given by Brinton record the oc-<lb/>
currence of the pestilence--&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mayacimil</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ocnalkuchil</hi>.&rdquo; May we<lb/>
conclude from this that the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mayacimil</hi>&rdquo; before the Conquest was itself<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>&rdquo;? Certainly this is suggested, but it does not seem especially<lb/>
probable. In the records which purport to be historical for the period<lb/>
before the Conquest, we have only the non-descriptive terms &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">maya-<lb/>
cimil</hi>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ocnalkuchil</hi>.&rdquo; If this served to mark <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> as a<lb/>
period of pestilence, it would seem natural that after &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>&rdquo;" became<lb/>
known it might have been identified, in the minds of the natives, with<lb/>
the then traditional pestilence of the past, itself already associated with<lb/>
their <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>, and thus might have come into their predictions.</p>
<p>In addition to the various books of Chilan Balam, from which these<lb/>
extracts are taken, there are a number of what may be called &ldquo;prescrip-<lb/>
tions&rdquo; for &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>&rdquo; in Maya manuscripts--in &ldquo;The Book of the Jew,&rdquo; for<lb/>
example. We seem to have no data as to the dates of these: whether<lb/>
they preceded the Conquest or not. The copies we have were tran-<lb/>
scribed long afterwards. Until these data are forthcoming these &ldquo;pre-<lb/>
scriptions&rdquo; throw no light on our subject. It is interesting to note,<lb/>
however, that they do show that, in this matter, Mayan psychology was<lb/>
identical with that of other unrelated primitive people. Just as the<lb/>
Romans regarded even a sight of the yellow bird, <hi rend="italic">Icterus</hi>, a cure for<lb/>
jaundice, and as the English hung red curtains about the beds of those sick<lb/>
of scarlet fever or smallpox, so the Mayas regarded red feathers as the<lb/>
proper remedy for blood-vomit.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTIONS OF MAYA PESTILENCES BY EUROPEANS FROM MAYA<lb/>
TRADITION</p>
<p>(1) The description which Bishop Landa (1864, p. 60), from Maya<lb/>
tradition, gives of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">maya cimlal</hi>&rdquo; is as follows: &ldquo;Then began over<lb/>
all the land some pestilential fevers which lasted twenty-four hours,<lb/>
and after that they ceased they&rdquo; (the people) &ldquo;swelled and burst, full of<lb/>
worms, and of this pestilence many people died.&rdquo; Landa came to Yuca-<lb/>
tan in 1549 and finished his book between 1562 and 1566. In getting<lb/>
the data for it he had unusual facilities, including the assistance of Don<lb/>
Juan Cocom of the family of Cocomes, rulers of Mayapan, &ldquo;a man of<lb/>
high standing and learned in the history of his people.&rdquo; Landa's<lb/>
arrival was, then, between sixty and seventy years after the reputed<lb/>
date of the pestilence (1483 or 1485). Yet, even with a greater interval<lb/>
of time, one would have thought that if vomiting of blood had been so<lb/>
<pb n="133" id="Cb000149"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
133<lb/>
marked a symptom of this pestilence as to give its name to it, this would<lb/>
have been remembered and the name mentioned.<hi rend="superscript">17</hi></p>
<p>(2) Benzoni (1565, p. 98), arriving in Yucatan about 1541, quotes a<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">cacique</hi> &ldquo;of more than 110 years&rdquo; as telling Montejo: &ldquo;In the time of<lb/>
my youth there came in this country a general malady so strange and<lb/>
so cruel that men vomited worms by the mouth, of which there was<lb/>
a <hi rend="italic">peste</hi> and a mortality so great that we thought we would all die thereof.&rdquo;<lb/>
This was between fifty-four and fifty-seven years after the epidemic,<lb/>
and an old man, even if not &ldquo;of more than 110 years&rdquo; as Benzoni claimed,<lb/>
should have remembered so marked a symptom as the vomiting of blood<lb/>
had it been a characteristic of the disease. This indeed, seems rather to<lb/>
connect up with the picture in the <hi rend="italic">Codex Telleriano-Remensis</hi> of the<lb/>
&ldquo;mortality&rdquo; of the year 1 Rabbit (1454) which, considering the locality<lb/>
in which it occurred, could not have been yellow fever.</p>
<p>(3) The &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">pestilencia de unos granos</hi>&rdquo; (the plague of pustules or bumps),<lb/>
which Landa records as occurring thirty-six years after that of &ldquo;worms<lb/>
and swellings,&rdquo; from its description should have been smallpox, and this<lb/>
coincides fairly well with the introduction of smallpox in 1520 at Cozu-<lb/>
mel. Thirty-six years after 1485, the date he would give to the occur-<lb/>
rence of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">maya cimlal</hi>,&rdquo; would give 1521; and as the Maya year does<lb/>
not begin on January 1, one year of their calendar would necessarily<lb/>
cover parts of two consecutive years of ours, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Neither Landa's &ldquo;plague of the swellings&rdquo; nor the one Benzoni's<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">cacique</hi> had in mind, whether the &ldquo;maya cimlal&rdquo; or not, can well be ac-<lb/>
cepted as &ldquo;xekik,&rdquo; a sickness marked by the vomiting of blood, or as yel-<lb/>
low fever. Note that the &ldquo;plague of swellings&rdquo; seems to have occurred<lb/>
about the date (1485 A.D.) ascribed to the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">maya cimlal</hi>&rdquo; in three of<lb/>
the Maya historical records.</p>
<p>Finally, the writer must confess that he has been unable to adduce</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">17</hi> Take this account of Landa's--clearly from Maya tradition--in connection<lb/>
with the &ldquo;occurrence of <hi rend="italic">kuk</hi>&rdquo; in Quotations III and IV. This word means &ldquo;a<lb/>
sprout: a new growth.&rdquo; Dr. Spinden (personal letter, 1922) gives &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">kukul</hi>&rdquo; as<lb/>
&ldquo;a hard conical swelling,&rdquo; as does the Dictionary of Pio Perez (1866-77, p. 186).<lb/>
Landa's informant then may have had in mind buboes which swelled and broke<lb/>
and became infested with maggots. Labat (1722, p. 73) notes: &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">des buboes--aux<lb/>
aisnes, les unes plein de sang caill&eacute; noir &amp; putant, &amp; les autres plein des vers</hi>,&rdquo; as<lb/>
one of the manifestations of the epidemic at Martinique, as do some of the histo-<lb/>
rians of the disease (diseases?) which prevailed at Isabela soon after its foundation.<lb/> 
Buboes from venereal disease would scarcely be epidemic, and yet a number of<lb/>
them, infested with maggots--&ldquo;plein des vers,&rdquo; as Labat records--might well<lb/>
impress a Mayan observer, as they evidently did the Europeans.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>any valid evidence for the existence of yellow fever among the Mayas<lb/>
prior to 1648 from such of their records as are available to him. Natur-<lb/>
ally, he can not tell what future research in the Maya territory may<lb/>
bring to light. Yet if the Maya records show nothing that we can accept<lb/>
as evidence for the existence of yellow fever in their country before the<lb/>
Conquest, they show nothing for this period that excludes its presence,<lb/>
for had it existed as an endemic disease it had been little apt to be noted<lb/>
in their records.</p>
<p>However, if the native records by themselves give no evidence that is<lb/>
conclusive, either positively or negatively, an inquiry into the sanitary<lb/>
state of this region during and soon after the Spanish Conquest should<lb/>
throw some light upon its previous sanitary condition. It should<lb/>
assuredly do so if it had been a permanent endemic focus of yellow fever,<lb/>
and this inquiry we shall now take up.</p>
<p>EDITORS' NOTE: Since the author's death Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley, in a per-<lb/>
sonal communication of January 27, 1929, has furnished us the following addi-<lb/>
tional extracts from the &ldquo;Book of Chilam Balam of Tizimin.&rdquo; The extracts were<lb/>
made from the original manuscript by Dr. Ermilo Solis Alcala, who gave them to<lb/>
Dr. Morley with his translations into Spanish. The translations from Spanish<lb/>
into English are by Dr. Morley.</p>
<p>It will be noted that the second of these extracts is identical, in the Maya text,<lb/>
with that given by Dr. Carter as his &ldquo;Quotation III.&rdquo; That it is referred to a<lb/>
different folio is, we presume, due to the use of a different manuscript copy. It<lb/>
will be noted also that the first and third extracts given here are very similar,<lb/>
suggesting that the latter is a condensed version of the first.</p>
<p>Dr. Morley states that he &ldquo;believes the <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi> mentioned in these pages<lb/>
must have been that which began in 1477 and ended in 1497.&rdquo; At the same time he<lb/>
calls attention to the fact that the text refers to the horse, which came to Yucatan<lb/>
only with the Europeans.</p>

<p>Uuciyabnal erected the <hi rend="italic">katun</hi> (stone) in (<hi rend="italic">katun</hi>) 4 <hi rend="italic">Ahau</hi>. Chicheen is very<lb/>
unfortunate: the <hi rend="italic">milpero</hi> (corn-grower) at rising, turns his face toward the south,<lb/>
with his face covered up, with his eyes closed, lamenting his food; when they<lb/>
salute him, he does not wish to answer, as he does the governing of the lands. He<lb/>
is very niggardly in the food he eats, they stop saluting him, the others, because he<lb/>
does not salute them, he is proud; his mat and his bed face toward the west; mortal<lb/>
epidemics, foreign lords, governors reunited. Vomit of blood is the plague of this<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">katun</hi>; with trousers torn behind, with white clothes they look for bread; there<lb/>
appear the nests and the green shoots in the branches of the trees; there comes<lb/>

<head>THE MAYA COUNTRY: COMING OF THE SPANIARDS</head>
<pb n="136" id="Cb000152"/>
<p>EARLY EXPEDITIONS</p>
<p>The coast of Yucatan, in which country, at the coming of the Span-<lb/>
iards, centered the Maya power, was visited by Columbus in 1502. His<lb/>
brother, Bartolom&eacute;, landing on an island, Cuanaja in the Gulf of Hon-<lb/>
duras, formally took possession of it. Seven Spaniards of the wrecked<lb/>
expedition of Valdivia from Darien for Cuba, landed near Cozumel in<lb/>
1511.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>
<p>Other expeditions came from Cuba: that of Cordoba in 1517, that of<lb/>
Grijalva in 1518, and finally that of Cortez in 1519. These explored<lb/>
the coasts, landed at a number of places, and went up the few rivers as far<lb/>
as there was water to float them, but none went far inland.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Narvaez<lb/>
landed at Cozumel in 1520 and left smallpox behind him; he also intro-<lb/>
duced this disease into the City of Mexico.</p>
<p>Cortez marched across the southern part of Yucatan in 1524 and 1525,<lb/>
on his expedition to Honduras, with a considerable number of Spaniards,<lb/>
some of them &ldquo;new come from Castile,&rdquo; and more than 3,000 Mexicans.<lb/>
Both of these groups should have been susceptible to yellow fever.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> It</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Five of them were eaten by Indians. One, Ger&oacute;nimo de Aguilar, &ldquo;a cleric and<lb/>
a learned man,&rdquo; stayed as a much trusted slave until 1519, when he was taken off by<lb/>
Cortez. The other, Gonzalo de Guerrero, was adopted by the Indians and rose to<lb/>
high rank, War Chief, among them and, Bishop Landa (1864, pp. 12-16) says,<lb/>
&ldquo;became an idolater.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> With all three was our old friend, Bernal Diaz del Castillo, whose rather inti-<lb/>
mate account of the country is simply invaluable. He was so very human. Dur-<lb/>
ing the expedition of Grijalva, which went along the Mexican coast as well, as far<lb/>
as Ulua (Vera Cruz): &ldquo;There were so many mosquitoes on this river&rdquo; (Coatza-<lb/>
coalcos) &ldquo;that we went . . . up to a high house of Idols to sleep and near to that<lb/>
house I planted some orange seeds, which I had brought from Cuba . . . and they<lb/>
grew very well . . . . the Papas (priests) of those idols took care of them . . . .<lb/>
having recognized them for plants new to them.&rdquo; After the Conquest of Mexico<lb/>
and his return from Honduras with Cortez in 1526 or 1527 he was assigned an<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">encomienda</hi> in this region, looked for, found, and moved his orange trees to it,<lb/>
&ldquo;where they succeed well.&rdquo; Doubtless these were the first orange trees on the<lb/>
continent of North America.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> However, Guiteras says, and truly, that there would have been little chance<lb/>
for a recognizable outbreak of yellow fever in this expedition even had there been</p>

<pb n="137" id="Cb000153"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
137</p>
<p>was far from being an unknown country, then, when Montejo seriously<lb/>
undertook its conquest in 1527.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, in none of their expeditions except that of Montejo,<lb/>
nor in fighting backwards and forwards over the country to 1542 and<lb/>
later, make mention of any sickness which can reasonably be considered<lb/>
yellow fever. Possibly the men of the earlier expeditions (prior to<lb/>
1524) had been in America long enough to have acquired immunity<lb/>
to yellow fever if it were prevalent in such parts of America as they<lb/>
had lived in. If so, its non-occurrence in these men in Yucatan would<lb/>
have no significance as indicating absence of the infection there. This is<lb/>
the explanation offered by Finlay and B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud, who claim that<lb/>
yellow fever was indigenous on the Mexican littoral. True, the men<lb/>
coming to Yucatan had all sailed from Cuba, then considered a very<lb/>
healthful country and believed to have been free from yellow fever until<lb/>
long after this time (Finlay, 1912); but many of them had come via, and<lb/>
it may be had lived in, Hispaniola or other Spanish settlements in the<lb/>
Caribbean, where it was thought they might have contracted the disease<lb/>
and thus have become immunized to it.</p>
<p>This, however, cannot be alleged to the same extent of the subsequent<lb/>
expeditions. The invasions, after the first one of Montejo's, were all<lb/>
from Mexico; some by sea and some by land. Along with a leaven of the<lb/>
old Conquistadores, mainly in command, they must have contained<lb/>
many newcomers from Spain, whose sole experience of America, except<lb/>
crossing the coast country when they landed, was that in the uplands of<lb/>
Mexico. The emigration from Spain to Mexico had begun early and<lb/>
soon became large. Even in the expedition which Cortez led to Hon-<lb/>
duras in 1524, for which one would have supposed only picked men would<lb/>
have been selected, there were a number of men &ldquo;new come from<lb/>
Castile,&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">4</hi></p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>infected foci in Yucatan, as the march might well have missed such foci. More-<lb/>
over, one feels like adding that even if they did come upon a focus of infection, the<lb/>
worst that would happen would be the development of yellow fever in the few who<lb/>
became infected during their short stay therein, as the expedition did not stay long<lb/>
enough in any one place for <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> infected there from men in the expedition to<lb/>
become infective and convey the disease to others during their stay. Hence no<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">epidemic</hi>, or even serious outbreak, should have been expected.</p>
<p>The same condition of mobility did not exist in Montejo's expedition nor in<lb/>
those subsequent to it, some of which, as that of Montejo at Chichen Itza, formed<lb/>
more or less permanent camps.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> For these Bernal Diaz shows all the contempt of an &ldquo;old timer&rdquo; plainsman<lb/>
for a &ldquo;tenderfoot.&rdquo; He especially deplores their inability to forage for them-</p>
<pb n="138" id="Cb000154"/>
<p>138<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>MONTEJO'S EXPEDITION, 1527</p>
<p>Montejo's men were recruited in Spain and hence were neither im-<lb/>
mune to American infections nor familiar with pioneer conditions of liv-<lb/>
ing in the tropics.</p>
<p>En route from Spain they stopped at Hispaniola, where they took on<lb/>
some supplies and where they left their sick, with one vessel. The<lb/>
remainder, apparently about 400 men, landed on the island of Cozumel,<hi rend="superscript">5</hi><lb/>
but after a few days moved over to the mainland and established there<lb/>
a post or &ldquo;town,&rdquo; Salamanca, upon a site which all authorities agree was<lb/>
ill chosen, bordering on a swamp. This, says Cogolludo (1688, <hi rend="italic">lib.</hi> ii, <hi rend="italic">cap.</hi><lb/>
v <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>), was at the place later called Valladolid: Oviedo (<hi rend="italic">tom</hi>, iii, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. 217<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>) calls it Xala. Here occurred some sickness of which Cogolludo<lb/>
says merely, &ldquo;some fell sick . . . . from the excessive heat.&rdquo; Oviedo,<lb/>
whose account should be more authoritative, says: &ldquo;There died a great<lb/>
part of the men.&rdquo; He attributes the deaths to lack of provisions and<lb/>
all necessities, to bad water and new airs, and to vampire bats which<lb/>
&ldquo;killed more than forty!&rdquo; &ldquo;Departing from this bad place,&rdquo; says<lb/>
Oviedo, and leaving there forty men &ldquo;sick and incapacitated,&rdquo; Montejo<lb/>
proceeded about fifteen leagues to Pole (or Pol&eacute;), &ldquo;in which place died<lb/>
almost the greater part of the men who remained to him and he was<lb/>
near the end of life.&rdquo; On his departure from Pole, Montejo left there<lb/>
twenty sick men &ldquo;who were not able to go out&rdquo; (whom the Indians later<lb/>
killed), and took with him a force now reduced to ninety. With these,<lb/>
he proceeded from place to place along the coast and inland as far as<lb/>
Chichen Itza, returning to Salamanca after some four to six months.<lb/>
By this time his force was diminished to sixty, according to Oviedo, who<lb/> 
accounts for not more than ten or twelve as having been killed in battle.<lb/>
Meanwhile, according to the same authority, the forty who had been<lb/>
left at Salamanca had endured such privations that all but twelve had<lb/>
died, making a total of seventy-two survivors. Molina Solis (1896,<lb/>
p. 401-2), whose account agrees with that of Oviedo, but is more<lb/>
detailed, gives the number of survivors as eighty-eight--eighteen in the<lb/>
garrison at Salamanca and seventy returning with Montejo. Soon after</p>

worthy captain was notably free. He was, too, a most successful and generous<lb/>
forager.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> The date of arrival at Cozumel is given by Oviedo as September, 1528.<lb/>
Molina Solis, who cites Oviedo as authority, gives the time as September, 1527.<lb/>
Cogolludo places the departure from Spain in 1527, but states that he is unable<lb/>
to verify the month.</p>
<pb n="139" id="Cb000155"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
139</p>
<p>the return to Salamanca, the ship that had been left at Hispaniola<lb/>
arrived, bringing well men and provisions. With these and later rein-<lb/>
forcements the Spaniards were able to maintain themselves in the country<lb/>
until 1535, when they were temporarily driven out.</p>
<p>The mortality from sickness is mentioned in the contemporary ac-<lb/>
counts of two eye-witnesses. The &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Relati&oacute;n of Blas Gonz&aacute;lez</hi>,&rdquo; quoted<lb/>
by Molina Solis (p. 382) says: &ldquo;We were on that coast two months,<lb/>
without entering the land, from which befell many sicknesses and the<lb/>
deaths of fifty soldiers.&rdquo; If the two months include the time spent<lb/>
at Pole, the mortality is considerably less than is implied by Oviedo.<lb/>
A letter from Montejo to the King of Spain, dated at Vera Cruz, April<lb/>
13, 1529 (<hi rend="italic">Colecci&oacute;n de Documentos in&eacute;ditos del Archivo de Indias</hi>,<lb/>
1864-84, <hi rend="italic">tom</hi>. 13, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. 86-91), refers to the great difficulties encountered<lb/>
and says: &ldquo;Some men and horses have died in war, but the most have<lb/>
died of sickness, not through fault of the land, which in truth is very<lb/>
good and healthful, and very fruitful and of many provisions and of<lb/>
very good waters, but . . . . on account of the change in rations.&rdquo; This,<lb/>
while confirming the fact of much sickness and many deaths, is a very<lb/>
restrained statement if it refers to such mortality as Oviedo reports. It<lb/>
seems possible, then, that Oviedo's account, though it is sufficiently<lb/>
circumstantial, may be in error as to either the number of survivors or<lb/>
the number originally engaged in the expedition. But even with a<lb/>
liberal allowance for exaggeration, there is sufficient evidence of exces-<lb/>
sive mortality from sickness.</p>
<p>There is no description of this sickness, either clinical or epidemio-<lb/>
logical, which serves to identify it. The high mortality, and its occur-<lb/>
rence early, in encampments, are consistent with the supposition that<lb/>
the disease may have been yellow fever, but other causes are not ex-<lb/>
cluded. In the absence of more conclusive direct evidence, judgment<lb/>
must rest chiefly on subsequent history in the same region. On this<lb/>
basis, the probabilities are, I think, against this having been yellow fever.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">6</hi> Montejo came by Santo Domingo, where he stopped &ldquo;for provisions and re-<lb/>
freshings:&rdquo; took aboard fifty-three horses, and left his sick and one vessel to bring<lb/>
them later to Yucatan. So if we think the men of the earlier expeditions were<lb/>
immunized to yellow fever by brief residence in Santo Domingo, and that the sick-<lb/>
ness in Montejo's forces was yellow fever, we must admit the probability of his<lb/>
men having contracted it there and bringing it to Cozumel. Montejo, himself,<lb/>
was one of the original Conquistadores of Mexico, going in the original expedition<lb/>
of Cortez, in 1519, and had lived in Hispaniola for some years before this. If long<lb/>
residence in America gave immunity to yellow fever, he should have been immune.</p>

<p>140<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>NEGATIVE RECORD, 1528 TO 1648</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the cause of the sickness in Montejo's men,<lb/>
there is no record of anything after this which we can even suspect of<lb/>
being yellow fever in this region until 1648, 120 years later. In the<lb/>
meantime, cities had been founded and immigrants had come from Spain,<lb/>
among them many of the clergy, the causes and dates of whose deaths<lb/>
are frequently recorded. The records show that the Spaniards here<lb/>
considered the country very healthful and congratulated themselves<lb/>
that in Yucatan they were free from the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ayres mal&eacute;ficos</hi>&rdquo; known to<lb/>
prevail in Vera Cruz in the wet season and always at Nombre de Dios.<lb/>
Moreover, when the fever of 1648 occurred, although beginning with the<lb/>
Spaniards, it developed as a very general and widespread epidemic<lb/>
among both Spaniards and Indians, and of the old as well as the young.<lb/>
This could only happen if yellow fever either had never visited this<lb/>
region or had been long absent from it, and if this epidemic was the re-<lb/>
sult of a recent introduction.</p>
<p>QUESTION OF THE EXISTENCE OP YELLOW FEVER IN YUCATAN<lb/>
PRIOR TO 1648</p>
<p>Did yellow fever exist in this region at the time of the Spanish Con-<lb/>
quest? If so, it disappeared entirely during or soon after that Conquest<lb/>
and gave no evidence of its presence for over 100 years. If this region,<lb/>
taken as a whole, was, up to that time, a <hi rend="italic">permanent endemic focus</hi> of<lb/>
yellow fever, was there anything in the Conquest to make the disease<lb/>
disappear? One would think the contrary. The effect of movements<lb/>
of men in masses is generally to spread infection, and the advent of the<lb/>
susceptible soldiers from the highlands of Guatemala and from Tlaxcala<lb/>
and other parts of the Mexican plateau would especially have had that<lb/>
effect. True, one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> conceive of a great increase of infection thus pro-<lb/>
duced so completely immunizing a region that yellow fever is ultimately<lb/>
eliminated by that very increase. But there had been many wars in<lb/>
Yucatan before, assumed to have no such effect; and certainly the effect<lb/>
of wars as we have seen them in Cuba, Mexico, and Central America in<lb/>
recent years has been to spread and increase yellow fever. I think, then,<lb/>
we must conclude that yellow fever did not exist among the Mayas at<lb/>
this time, and hence that this region was not a permanent endemic focus<lb/>
of yellow fever.</p>
<p>Could it, at the time of the Conquest and earlier, have formed, with<lb/>
other places, a &ldquo;regional&rdquo; or &ldquo;circulating&rdquo; focus, within which the infec-<lb/>
<pb n="141" id="Cb000157"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
141<lb/>
tion, not permanent in any one place, was maintained by continuous<lb/>
transfers from one area to another?</p>
<p>If so, we must face the trilemma: either (a) we must admit this very<lb/>
long time, well over 100 years, as intervening between the infections of<lb/> 
Yucatan; or (b) that communication contaminative to Yucatan from the<lb/>
other places which, with it, formed this focus, had lessened at, or after,<lb/>
the time of the Conquest; or (c) that the infections of those other places<lb/>
had about this same time markedly diminished or disappeared and that<lb/>
the diminution of these contaminative communications, or of these infec-<lb/>
tions, or of their joint effect, must have been sufficient to leave Yucatan<lb/>
free from infection for over 100 years.</p>
<p>The first, I think, we must reject. So long an interval would imply so<lb/>
little contaminative communication with infected places that it would<lb/>
hardly be fair to consider them in the same focus, that is, as mutually<lb/>
contaminative.</p>
<p>For either of the last two to occur, the conquests of Mexico, or Yuca-<lb/>
tan, and of what is now Central America, and the <hi rend="italic">sequelae</hi> of these con-<lb/>
quests are the only new factors introduced. Can we accuse them as<lb/>
causing a disappearance of yellow fever?</p>
<p>The regions in reasonable communication with Yucatan and physi-<lb/>
cally capable of forming part of a permanent focus, that is, of allowing the<lb/>
activity of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> at all seasons, were (1) the Gulf coast and coastal<lb/>
plain of Mexico, the <hi rend="italic">tierra caliente</hi>, and (2) the Caribbean coast and<lb/>
lowlands to the east of Yucatan.</p>
<p>For the second alternative, that communication contaminative to<lb/>
Yucatan had lessened, it seems clear that communication between the<lb/>
part of Mexico mentioned and Yucatan should have been not dimin-<lb/>
ished but increased, presumably greatly increased, as a result of the<lb/>
conquests. There had always been commerce by sea between nearby<lb/>
ports, and to a fair amount; but neither the Mayas nor the Mexicans<lb/>
were seafarers like the Caribs, and any considerable intercourse between<lb/>
the Mayas and this Mexican coast would have been by land, on foot,<lb/> 
and that without pack animals. The account by Bernal Diaz of the<lb/>
march of Cortez across the lowlands of Tehuantepec in 1524-25 shows<lb/>
how slow and difficult such a trip would be through a wooded country,<lb/> 
some of it sparsely settled, and hence with little food.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> Many died on this march, especially the Indian porters, and many were left<lb/>
sick along the route. The deaths were all ascribed by our historian, Bernal Diaz,<lb/>
to starvation, hardships, and accidents of the journey. Food was extremely scarce<lb/>
for a long time. This led to their eating their guides--they were from other</p>
<pb n="142" id="Cb000158"/>
<p>142<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>The same is true, only to a lesser extent, of the low country of Central<lb/>
America to the east of the Mayas. There was sea traffic in canoes from<lb/>
Yucatan along this coast for a short distance. Further along the coast<lb/>
the natives were of a much lower culture and were not in sufficient num-<lb/>
ber to have been of much importance in continuing the infection of<lb/>
yellow fever. There could, then, have been only limited communication<lb/>
between the Mayas and the coastal plains of either Mexico or Central<lb/>
America before the Conquest.</p>
<p>During the conquest of Yucatan, from 1527 to 1542, there was a con-<lb/>
stant stream of expeditions from Mexico: some by sea, starting from<lb/>
Vera Cruz, some by land. After the Conquest there was added to this<lb/>
commerce the normal traffic of a seafaring people between open ports.<lb/>
The Spaniards, and doubtless their Indian household servants, would go<lb/>
from place to place by sea. We have record of several of the clergy<lb/>
thus going from Vera Cruz to Campeche. Traffic by vessels, too, would<lb/>
be more apt to convey infection than that by land. Vessels, the crews of<lb/>
which must sometimes have been newcomers from Spain, lay long in the<lb/>
harbors of both of these ports. Vessels, too, would bring passengers<lb/>
quicker than they would come by land, would not leave the sick en<lb/> 
route, and, if from an infected port, could bring not only infected men,<lb/>
but infected <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>. The same increase of coastal communication took<lb/>
place from Guatemalan and Yucatecan ports, then including what is now<lb/>
British Honduras, to those to the east, especially Ocoa, Ulua, and<lb/>
Trujillo.</p>
<p>It is not reasonable, then, to think that Yucatan escaped infection on<lb/>
account of the Conquest lessening communication with any place from<lb/>
which it would have received the infection had the Conquest not taken<lb/>
place. Communication increased after the Conquest and, if from an<lb/>
infected place, became more dangerous.</p>
<p>The Conquest also opened communication with Cuba--negligible<lb/>
before--as shown by the different Spanish expeditions of 1517, 1518,<lb/>
and 1519 to Yucatan, of which one at least introduced smallpox. Cuba<lb/>
was probably then free from yellow fever (to 1649), but even if so,<lb/>
there was a chance of susceptible people coming to Yucatan from Cuba<lb/>
via the suspected Mexican ports. At any rate, it was at least a possible,<lb/>
if indirect, source of danger after the Conquest, not existent before.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>peoples and suitable for eating. This, however, added to their troubles, and even<lb/>
Bernal Diaz, who was in no wise squeamish in such matters, and who had ignored<lb/>
the eating of an occasional porter, confesses this to have been a tactical error<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">op. cit., cap.</hi> 175 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>).</p>
<pb n="143" id="Cb000159"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
143</p>
<p>For the third alternative. Was there anything in the Conquest to<lb/>
cause a lessening or a disappearance of yellow fever in Mexico or Central<lb/>
America if it existed in either of these areas? None is obvious. Our<lb/>
experience has been that in any dynastic upheaval involving the mass<lb/>
of the people, strangers are brought into the infected territory and yellow<lb/>
fever increases. There was a less sudden disturbance in the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> life<lb/>
of the Mexicans by the Conquest than one would have thought, but after<lb/>
the mines were opened, prior to 1544 when Motolinia wrote, there was<lb/>
a shifting of native and Spanish population to the lowlands, where, if<lb/>
anywhere, yellow fever should have been found.<hi rend="superscript">8</hi> Without question,<lb/>
then, such disturbance as was set up by the Conquest, the immigration<lb/>
and movements of the Spaniards, and the vessels with European crews<lb/>
lying in port, all tended to increase and spread any infection of yellow<lb/>
fever already existent in the <hi rend="italic">tierra caliente</hi> of Mexico and in the lowlands<lb/>
to the east of Yucatan.</p>
<p>To sum up: quite certainly the effect of the Conquest would have<lb/>
been: (1) to increase the prevalence of any yellow fever already existing<lb/>
in Yucatan, in Mexico, or in Central America; (2) to increase the com-<lb/>
munication between Yucatan and the coast sections of the other two;<lb/>
and (3) if any one of these regions were infected with yellow fever, to<lb/>
increase the danger of its communication to others, as every condition<lb/>
favoring infection and the spread of infection was increased by the<lb/>
Conquest.</p>
<p>Therefore, and since, in fact, the Conquest having taken place,<lb/>
Yucatan was not infected for well over 100 years thereafter, it is not<lb/>
reasonable to claim that it would have been infected during this time if<lb/> 
the Conquest had not taken place. The evidence, then, is strong--to<lb/>
my mind convincing--that at the time of the Conquest Yucatan was<lb/>
neither a <hi rend="italic">permanent endemic focus</hi> of yellow fever nor a component part<lb/>
of a <hi rend="italic">permanent regional focus</hi>.</p>
<p>One may go further. After the Conquest, even if the direct commun-<lb/>
ication from the Mexican coast to Yucatan were not very free, yet if the<lb/>
Mexican coast were infected with yellow fever it would seem that, in less<lb/>
than the 120 years which did elapse, Yucatan would have received this<lb/>
infection and, if <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> were prevalent there, would have shown an epi-<lb/>
demic. It would seem, then, that the decision here must be: (a) the<lb/>
Mexican coast was not all of this time infected with yellow fever, or</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">8</hi> Bernal Diaz states that most of the places where gold was obtained, listed in<lb/>
the tribute book of Montezuma, were in the lower country, and thither directed<lb/>
his steps with Sandoval.</p>
<pb n="144" id="Cb000160"/>
<p>144<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>(b) <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> were not all of this time prevalent in Yucatan. The first con-<lb/>
clusion seems unavoidable in any case, because, if we accept the second,<lb/>
that <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> were not prevalent during all of this time in Yucatan, where<lb/>
the conditions were so well suited for them, it follows almost inevitably<lb/>
that they would be lacking on the Mexican coast as well. Hence, prior<lb/>
to their introduction, the latter could not be infected with yellow fever.</p>
<p>That <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> were prevalent in Yucatan in 1648 goes without saying--<lb/>
else there had been no epidemic. So were they prevalent in Memphis<lb/>
in 1878, but not in 1853; in Fernandina in 1877, but not in 1876. The<lb/>
writer is not denying that they may have been indigenous in Yucatan;<lb/>
only the fact that they were there in 1648 is not proof that they were<lb/>
indigenous.</p>
<p>In any case, it seems to him that with the data we have on Yucatan,<lb/>
one of the above conclusions, (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), is inevitable, and the first must be<lb/>
accepted in any case since it is implied in the second. Nowhere about<lb/>
the Caribbean do the pre-Columbian conditions for the breeding and<lb/>
existence of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> seem to have been so good as among the Mayas.<lb/>
If <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> were not prevalent there during this time, obviously they<lb/>
were not indigenous to this region--they could not have died out--but<lb/>
were introduced later. If not indigenous to Yucatan, it is extremely<lb/>
improbable that they were indigenous to the Mexican littoral. That<lb/>
being so, yellow fever could not have originated and been permanently<lb/>
endemic in either of these areas.</p>

<p>The conclusions from the epidemiological argument of the last chap-<lb/>

attacking Spaniards and Indians, old and young alike; and (2) that<lb/>
previously there had been none in that region for a very long time, cer-<lb/>
tainly not since the Spanish invasion of 1527, and probably not since<lb/>
1517. Let us see if the bases of this argument are secure. On it ulti-<lb/>
mately rest our conclusions.</p>
<p>For the second part of it-- the absence of yellow fever since the Span-<lb/>
ish knew the country--we have only the absolute non-report in any<lb/>
historical record until 1648 of anything which can be even suspected of<lb/>
being yellow fever or, indeed, of any epidemic disease save those intro-<lb/>
duced by Europeans. And this under conditions in which yellow fever<lb/>
would almost inevitably have been mentioned had it occurred. Indeed,<lb/>
unlike Vera Cruz and Nombre de Dios, Yucatan was considered extremely<lb/>
healthful by the Spaniards.</p>
<p>THE RECORD OF SICKNESS UP TO 1648</p>
<p>One finds epidemics noted in Yucatan after the Spanish invasion of<lb/>
1527, but until 1648 all are of European diseases: smallpox, measles, and<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tabardillo</hi>&rdquo; (sometimes typhus, sometimes scarlet fever, one thinks)<lb/>
mentioned by name. A number of local epidemics of the above, diseases<lb/>
of the chest, catarrhs, etc., are all recorded in the health reports of the<lb/>
different districts during the latter part of the sixteenth century and the<lb/>
early part of the seventeenth.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>
<p>Besides the great epidemic of smallpox already mentioned as occurring</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Among the <hi rend="italic">Documentos In&eacute;ditos de Ultramar</hi>, published of late years at<lb/>
Madrid, are the <hi rend="italic">Relaciones de Yucat&aacute;n</hi>, edited by Don Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Asensio y<lb/>
Toledo (1898-1900). These are formal reports, fiscal, sociological, religious, and<lb/>
sanitary, of the different divisions of Yucatan under Spanish rule. The earliest<lb/>
date I have found is 1580, whence they run to about 1620. Many are undated.<lb/>
They are by men far less cultivated than the ecclesiastics, by whom the great ma-<lb/>
jority of our documents of this time were written, and are evidently filled-out<lb/>
forms given to these inspectors. A section of each report is on the state of health</p>

<p>146<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>prior to 1528, several others are mentioned in both Maya and Spanish<lb/>
records. Cogolludo, for instance, notes an epidemic of smallpox,<lb/>
measles, and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">tabardillo</hi>&rdquo; (quite certainly scarlet fever here) in Merida<lb/>
in 1609, which &ldquo;greatly afflicted the citizens and, to a small extent, the<lb/>
Spaniards.&rdquo; This is possibly the &ldquo;smallpox&rdquo; mentioned in the &ldquo;Book of<lb/>
Chilan Balam of Mani&rdquo; (Brinton, 1882, p. 104). Molina Solis (vol. 1, p.<lb/>
130) mentions an unnamed &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; in 1571, following a famine. This<lb/>
may be the &ldquo;smallpox occurred&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Book of Chilan Balam of Tizi-<lb/>
min&rdquo; (Brinton, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> page 142) of 1569, which notes no sickness in 1571.<lb/>
Another &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>,&rdquo; confined to Indians, and hence probably smallpox,<lb/>
certainly not yellow fever, is also noted by Molina Solis in 1561. The<lb/>
negative evidence adduced is, to the writer, convincing that yellow fever<lb/>
was absent during this period.</p>
<p>If the history and epidemiology of the epidemic of 1648 shows (1)<lb/>
that it was yellow fever, and (2) that it occurred in a generally suscep-<lb/>
tible (virgin) community, we may claim as proven that yellow fever<lb/>
either had never before visited this region or had been long absent.</p>
<p>For the first part of our argument we are exceedingly fortunate.<lb/>
There can be no doubt as to the nature of the epidemic of 1648. Indeed,<lb/>
the writer considers it the first one that we can certainly recognize from<lb/>
its description as being yellow fever. The &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; at Guadeloupe, begin-<lb/>
ning a month or two later the same year,<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> noted but less fully de-<lb/>
scribed by du Tertre (1667, vol. 1, pp. 421-22), is accepted as, and we<lb/>
believe was, yellow fever, as was not unlikely &ldquo;the Plague or as killing a<lb/>
disease&rdquo; that Ligon (1673) found in early September, 1647, at Barbados,<lb/>
but of which he gave no description. So <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi>, but very improbably,<lb/>
was the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; of Guadeloupe of 1635, which good P&egrave;re Breton<lb/>
(1665) both notes and describes--of all places in the world--in a Carib-<lb/>
French dictionary.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>of the division surveyed. In these <hi rend="italic">Relaciones</hi>, then, we have an unusually com-<lb/>
plete and detailed picture of the <hi rend="italic">sanitary</hi> history of Yucatan for the time covered.</p>
<p>They are rather quaint reading sometimes. Francisco Pecho (only a very<lb/>
few of these inspectors use the <hi rend="italic">de</hi>, showing that they were not of the upper classes),<lb/>
reporting under date of February 20 (the only date given in days), 1581, expresses<lb/>
doubt of the Christian faith of the Cacique of Cacalchen, &ldquo;as to his devil he still<lb/>
sacrifices dogs, birds, <hi rend="italic">and some boys (algunos muchachos)</hi>.&rdquo; (Italics the writer's.)<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Op. cit.</hi>, vol. i, p. 129.)</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> It appeared in Guadeloupe about the last part of July, brought there by a ship<lb/>
from St. Christophe. Whether the outbreak at St. Christophe preceded that at<lb/>
Campeche, in Yucatan, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, we do not know. I can find no record of the<lb/>
epidemic of this year at St. Christophe save du Tertre's note.</p>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
147</p>
<p>For none of these could it be claimed, however, that they were certainly<lb/>
identified as yellow fever by their descriptions. I think we can claim<lb/>
this for the &ldquo;peste&rdquo; of 1648 in Yucatan, and to that end quote at some<lb/>
length in quite literal translation the account of Cogolludo, as given in<lb/>
his <hi rend="italic">Historia de Yucathan</hi> (1688, <hi rend="italic">lib</hi>. xii, <hi rend="italic">cap.</hi> 12, <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>).<hi rend="superscript">3</hi></p>
<p>LOPEZ DE COGOLLUDO'S ACCOUNT OF THE EPIDEMIC</p>
<p>Cogolludo states that the usual portents presaging a great calamity<lb/>
were noted, probably after the event; among them a dense fog, &ldquo;which<lb/>
seeing, the old Indians said it was a sign of great mortality of people in<lb/>
this land, and for our sins, this came out a certain truth, as in a short<lb/>
time we experienced . . . In the beginning of June the <hi rend="italic">peste</hi> began in the<lb/>
city of Campeche<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> and in a few days so pressed on it that it was totally<lb/>
laid waste.&rdquo; He quotes a letter from a citizen: &ldquo;If God does not pity<lb/>
our misery and soon soften the rigor of His justice it will be said &lsquo;Here<lb/>
was Campeche,&rsquo; as it was said of Troy . . . The roads from Campeche<lb/>
were guarded, fearing communication of the contagion . . . With this<lb/>
fear . . . passed the month of July, in the end of which began some people&rdquo;<lb/>
(in Merida) &ldquo;to sicken, who died very soon, but it was not recognized to<lb/>
be the <hi rend="italic">peste</hi> until the beginning of August. With such quickness and<lb/>
violence it came on great and little, rich and poor, that in less than eight<lb/>
days almost the whole city was sick at one time and many of the citizens<lb/>
of highest name and authority in it died. The city, afflicted with such<lb/>
a misfortune <hi rend="italic">not seen before since this land was conquered by the Spanish<lb/>
nation</hi><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> . . . sought leave to bring in the Holy Image of Our Lady of<lb/>
Izamal . . .</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">3</hi> This account is given more fully and in much smoother, although less literal,<lb/>
English in <hi rend="italic">Los Trabajos Selectos</hi> of Carlos J. Finlay (1912) pages 214-216.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Before this, he says: &ldquo;In the months of April and May are seen some deaths,<lb/>
which caused perturbation in the city of Merida.&rdquo; Presumably he means deaths<lb/>
in Merida. If so, this cannot have been the beginning of the epidemic; else,<lb/>
Merida being evidently infested with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, the epidemic would have declared<lb/>
itself long before August. This is mentioned here, as are several other unneces-<lb/>
sary passages of our writer, in a spirit of fairness, that the reader may have the<lb/>
whole story before him, even if some of it be of little value, and may form his own<lb/>
conclusions. Cogolludo evidently considered the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; as brought from Cam-<lb/>
peche to Merida.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">No vista otra vez desde que se conquist&oacute; esta tierra entre la naci&oacute;n espa&ntilde;ola</hi>.&rdquo;<lb/>
There are no italics in the original, but the writer, following Dr. Finlay (and there<lb/>
is no man whom he had rather follow), is italicizing a number of passages: (1)<lb/>
those that especially show likeness to yellow fever, (2) those which tend to show<lb/>
that this was the first epidemic in Yucatan, and (3) two places pertinent to a<lb/>
Maya text already given (page 125).</p>
<pb n="148" id="Cb000164"/>
<p>148<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most part of the Indians of Izamal, who attended the Holy Image<lb/>
on the road and in the City of Merida, were attacked by the contagion<lb/>
of the <hi rend="italic">peste</hi> in it and a few days after they arrived at Izamal, passed<lb/>
from this present life . . . Some religious companions of the Convent<lb/>
of Izamal, who accompanied the going and return of the Holy Image<lb/>
. . . . were also taken with the contagion and of them died those <hi rend="italic">who<lb/>
appeared most healthy and robust</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether Izamal was infected by these people, who developed the<lb/>
disease in it, one does not know, yet only those who made the trip to<lb/>
Merida are mentioned as having fallen ill. Molina Solis (vol. 2, p. 175),<lb/>
however, states that &ldquo;in September all the district of Izamal was<lb/>
infected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tribulation of the city was very great as <hi rend="italic">never had it experienced<lb/>
such a disaster</hi> . . . In the beginning&rdquo; (in Merida) &ldquo;few of the Friars<lb/>
died . . . when the <hi rend="italic">peste</hi> was at its height few were sick . . . afterwards<lb/>
many sickened at once&rdquo; (Cogolludo, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>).</p>
<p>The friars lived in cloisters, and at first they would be infected only<lb/>
as they visited the infected houses in town. As those thus infected<lb/>
sickened, they infected the <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> in their cloisters and, after the period<lb/>
of extrinsic incubation in the insects, plus the period of incubation in the<lb/>
men whom the mosquitoes infected had passed (together about 17 to<lb/>
20 days, usually), they would go down in numbers, as happened at<lb/>
Orwood and Taylor, Mississippi, in 1898. This is quite characteristic<lb/>
of yellow fever; and this interval, during which only a few friars were<lb/>
sick, would be 30 to 40 days, or maybe a few more, from the beginning of<lb/>
the attacks of the men from whom, indirectly, the friars were infected<lb/>
in the city. Our historian has here given us unconsciously an observa-<lb/>
tion which dovetails in with the epidemiology of yellow fever so per-<lb/>
fectly as almost to <hi rend="italic">compel</hi> the diagnosis of it, or some other host-borne<lb/>
disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pestilences are accustomed to be a common accident in other lands,<lb/>
which uniformly attack all, <hi rend="italic">but it was not thus in Yucatan</hi>, which was the<lb/>
occasion of the greater confusion. It is not possible to say <hi rend="italic">what was this<lb/>
malady, because the physicians did not recognize it</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In giving the symptoms: &ldquo;The most common was for the patients to<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">be taken with a very severe and intense pain in the head and of all of the bones<lb/>
of the body, so violent that it appeared to dislocate them or to squeeze them as<lb/>
in a press</hi>. In a little while after the pain a most <hi rend="italic">vehement fever</hi>, which</p>
<pb n="149" id="Cb000165"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
149</p>
<p>to most occasioned delirium, although to some not. Followed some<lb/>
vomitings as of putrefied blood (<hi rend="italic">Segu&iacute;anse unos v&oacute;mitos de sangre como<lb/>
podrida</hi>) and of these very few remained alive. To others <hi rend="italic">there was a<lb/>
flow from the bowels of a bilious humor (humor col&eacute;rico)</hi> which&rdquo; (being)<lb/>
&ldquo;corrupted caused dysentery, which they call &lsquo;sin v&oacute;mitos&rsquo;. Others<lb/>
were provoked to them&rdquo; (vomitings) &ldquo;with great violence, but in vain,<lb/>
and many suffered the <hi rend="italic">calentura</hi> and pain in the bones without other<lb/>
accidents. . . . . <hi rend="italic">To the most the fever appeared to remit entirely on the<lb/>
third day; and they said that already they felt no pain; the delirium ceased,<lb/>
conversing sensibly</hi>, but they were not able to eat nor to drink anything<lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">thus going on one or more days</hi>, speaking and saying that they were<lb/>
well, <hi rend="italic">they died</hi>. There were many who did not pass the third day, <hi rend="italic">the<lb/>
most died beginning the fifth</hi>,<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> very few reached the seventh, except those<lb/>
who survived, and of these the most were elderly. It attacked young<lb/>
men, <hi rend="italic">the most robust and healthy with most violence and finished their lives<lb/>
the quickest</hi>. . . . Although very many women sickened, the sickness did<lb/>
not bear as hard on them as on men<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> . . . but it was rare that one found<lb/>
a pregnant woman who remained alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>,&rdquo; in Campeche in June and July, came &ldquo;as by a jump to<lb/>
Merida, not affecting any pueblo between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst lasted the force of the <hi rend="italic">peste</hi> among the Spaniards, the <hi rend="italic">Indians<lb/>
did not get sick, only those who were with them</hi>&rdquo; (the Spaniards) &ldquo;and those<lb/>
who went to the city. These went out touched with the malady and the<lb/>
most part died in their pueblos, but it did not attack those who assisted<lb/>
them" at their own pueblos. &ldquo;On this account the Indians said with<lb/>
boldness that the malady was a judgment of God, since they were<lb/>
sick only in the city and the towns&rdquo; (of the Spaniards). &ldquo;An Indian<lb/>
proclaimed that all the Spaniards of Yucatan had to die and that the<lb/>
Indians alone would remain&rdquo; . . . . Soon, a few days after the arrest of</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">6</hi> This is early. The majority of deaths in yellow fever occur on the sixth day,<lb/>
the great majority on the sixth or seventh. This shows the malignancy of the<lb/>
epidemic, further evidenced by the vomit's being recognizable as blood and hence<lb/>
named <hi rend="italic">xekik</hi> (blood-vomit) by the Mayas in the &ldquo;Book of Chilan Balam of<lb/>
Chumayel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> Both Ligon (1673), who saw it, and Scott (1688) noted the greater mortality<lb/>
among men than women of &ldquo;the Plague or as killing a disease&rdquo; in Barbados in<lb/>
September-November 1647. The first ascribed it to the drinking habits of the<lb/>
men. The latter stated &ldquo;as is usual with epidemicals, showing a favor to that<lb/>
sex.&rdquo;</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>this Indian, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">in many of their pueblos the same sickness showed as among<lb/>
the Spaniards, making fearful ravages as among a people without resources<lb/>
or medicines</hi>.&rdquo; The same explanation would apply here as in the delay<lb/>
of the sickness among the friars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sickness lasted in the whole land for the space of two years.<lb/>
Rare was it that he who was in, or entered into, this land those two<lb/>
years did not sicken, as <hi rend="italic">neither did they die of recurrences, having gone out<lb/>
of the first accident</hi>. All remained so pallid that they appeared dead:<lb/>
many without hair, with eyelashes dropped out, all so broken that<lb/>
although they had had only two days of fever and a little pain in the<lb/>
bones--as happened to me--many could not regain their strength.&ldquo;<lb/>
This, of course, is not like yellow fever. Weakness is, indeed, extreme<lb/>
in the early part of convalescence, but once established, convalescence<lb/>
is rapid, especially in light and moderate cases, and is complete. Ane-<lb/>
mia, save from venesection, is not a sequel of yellow fever. The writer<lb/>
has seen the loss of hair and eyebrows in only a few very bad cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to what I said, that the sickness killed the most robust youths the<lb/>
quickest, I will say . . . that of the children of tender age whom the <hi rend="italic">peste</hi><lb/>
attacked in Yucatan, <hi rend="italic">there were very few who died compared with people of<lb/>
more advanced age</hi>.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">8</hi></p>
<p>We are fortunate in our historian of this epidemic. He was evidently<lb/>
a man of ability, well educated, and a close and accurate observer.<lb/>
There is no comparison between his account and the note, we can call it<lb/>
no more, of the brilliant and versatile du Tertre on the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; at Guade-<lb/>
loupe the same year. And there can be little doubt that this was an</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">8</hi> Our historian was led to record this characteristic of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; by noting,<lb/>
when he left Merida in 1650 on a missionary journey to Guatemala, that in an<lb/>
extensive pine forest &ldquo;the same year of 1648, in which the <hi rend="italic">peste</hi> began, some pesti-<lb/>
lential air or other bad influence had dried up all the pines well grown and large<lb/>
. . . . all the new little pines remaining alive, and then I made this reflection,<lb/>
that of the children of tender age,&rdquo; etc. But for this, we would have missed his<lb/>
record of the low mortality of this epidemic among young children, a point of<lb/>
value in determining its relation to yellow fever.</p>
<p>Da Rocha Pitta (1730) in his account of the epidemic of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">a bicha</hi>&rdquo; at Bahia,<lb/>
Brazil, of 1686, noted the same lower mortality in children and explained it as due<lb/>
to God sparing the innocent, but not their sinful elders. He was somewhat put to it<lb/>
to account for the same phenomenon, and to a greater degree, among the negroes,<lb/>
of whose morality he had the lowest opinion; and rather adroitly turned it by<lb/>
asserting that the sins for the punishment of which &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">a bicha</hi>&rdquo; was sent, were the<lb/>
pride and luxury of the Brazilians, and thus it spared the humble. I judge there<lb/>
were very few negroes in Yucatan, else I am sure that their immunity had not<lb/>
escaped Cogolludo.</p>
<pb n="151" id="Cb000167"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
151</p>
<p>epidemic of yellow fever and in a generally susceptible--practically in a<lb/>
virgin--population. One salient point only has he left out, which<lb/>
we should have expected a layman to note--the frequency of yellowness<lb/>
in convalescence. He does not appear to have noted the dead at all.<hi rend="superscript">9</hi><lb/>
And one thing only has he noted as occurring which is not characteristic<lb/> 
of yellow fever--the description of the convalescence. Possibly he<lb/>
intended this word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">p&aacute;lidos</hi>&rdquo; to cover the yellowness of convalescence<lb/>
as well as anemia. I know of no other description by a layman, and<lb/>
none by anyone until years later, as complete as this. It is wonderful<lb/>
that in this--the first account of yellow fever recognizable definitely<lb/>
by its description--should be noted so many epidemiological facts,<lb/>
such as the lesser mortality of young children, the greater severity<lb/>
among the robust, the absence of a second attack, its delayed incidence<lb/>
and then sudden outburst among the friars and Indians. Indeed, we<lb/>
may say that not only can this &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; of 1648 be recognized to be yellow<lb/>
fever by its description, but that from its description we cannot fail to<lb/>
recognize it.</p>
<p>Note, too, how new the disease was to every one--&ldquo;it had not been<lb/>
seen before since the Spanish nation had conquered the land . . . . the<lb/>
physicians did not recognize it.&rdquo; Cogolludo, too, testified to Yucatan's<lb/>
reputation for healthfulness: other countries were accustomed to pesti-<lb/>
lences; &ldquo;it was not so in Yucatan,&rdquo; and on this account the blow was<lb/>
severer.</p>
<p>The bases for the argument of our preceding chapter seem, then, to be<lb/>
established, namely: (1) that Yucatan had had no epidemic of yellow<lb/>
fever since the beginning of the Spanish Conquest, 120 years prior; (2)<lb/>
that the epidemic of 1648 was one of yellow fever, and (3) in a virgin<lb/>
people.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">9</hi> The earliest note of jaundice as a symptom of yellow fever that the writer has<lb/>
been able to find (unless Cogolludo's &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">p&aacute;lidos</hi>&rdquo; implies it), and the only one until<lb/>
well into the eighteenth century, is by Dr. Jo&atilde;o Ferreira da Rosa in his &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Trattado<lb/>
Unico da Constitui&ccedil;am Pestilencial de Pernambuco</hi>,&rdquo; published at Lisbon, 1694.<lb/>
In <hi rend="italic">Disputada</hi> i, <hi rend="italic">Duvida</hi> iv: p. 28, he has: &ldquo;14. Above all signs there are two<lb/>
dreadful&rdquo; (fear-carrying) &ldquo;ones, which are the jaundice (or for another name<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">morbus regius</hi>) and the suppression of urine. The first an onerous and miserable<lb/>
prognosis&rdquo; (when) &ldquo;coming before the seventh day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally the designation of the disease as &ldquo;yellow fever&rdquo; by Griffith Hughes of<lb/>
Barbados in 1750 presupposes that jaundice had been then commonly noted in that<lb/>
country.</p>
<pb n="152" id="Cb000168"/>
<p>152<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>POSSIBLE ORIGIN OF THE EPIDEMIC</p>
<p>Why did this epidemic of yellow fever appear in Yucatan in 1648, for<lb/>
the first time, as the writer thinks, but certainly after an extremely long<lb/>
absence? What change had taken place either in the trade relations<lb/>
or in the sociological conditions of this country at or near this time which<lb/>
might introduce the infection or render it more capable of propagation?<lb/>
As we have said, the greater intercommunication between Yucatan and<lb/>
the other Spanish colonies, caused by the Conquest, would increase<lb/>
the risk of bringing yellow fever to Yucatan if it existed in such colonies.<lb/>
Indeed, any increased communication from foreign ports would increase<lb/>
the chance of the introduction of yellow fever in proportion to (1) its<lb/>
prevalence in such ports, and (2) the amount and nature of such<lb/>
communication.</p>
<p>Now a new species of maritime communication, the kind most apt to<lb/>
carry both <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> and yellow fever, had sprung up and had undergone<lb/>
great development not long before and during this year. The bucca-<lb/>
neers, French and English, mainly, but there were some Hollanders, had<lb/>
begun not only to prey upon Spanish vessels in these waters but to raid<lb/>
the towns close enough to the coast to be exposed to their attacks.<lb/>
And this coast seems to have been particularly troubled by these pirates<lb/>
for some time before. For example, in 1598, William Parker, an English<lb/>
pirate, took Campeche and sacked it. In 1633, pirates again captured<lb/>
Campeche, landing 800 men, and in 1644 Jacob Jackson sacked Champ-<lb/>
oton, well in the interior. He had 13 vessels and 1,500 men. Jackson<lb/>
returned next year, and captured certain Franciscans, and so on.</p>
<p>Both Cogolludo, writing at the time, and Molina Solis mention these<lb/>
pirates as being unusually prevalent and daring during the year 1648.<lb/>
In April, a frigate from Campeche to Vera Cruz, with more than 100,000<lb/>
pesos aboard, was captured. The same fate befell a vessel from Spain at<lb/>
Campeche. Later, a Captain Habrahan (possibly Wilbraham, a rather<lb/>
well known English pirate of his time) sacked Bakalar, one of Montejo's<lb/>
Salamancas, and carried off a number of women to a reef (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">los cayos</hi>&rdquo;)<lb/>
in the bay, whence they were finally rescued and brought back by an<lb/>
expedition &ldquo;of daring youths&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">during the pirates' absence</hi>. Certainly<lb/>
this involuntary intercourse with the buccaneers was a new and appar-<lb/>
ently an increasing factor in the life of Yucatan. Did it place this<lb/>
country, directly or indirectly, in communication with places infected<lb/>
with yellow fever?</p>
<p>The writer has alluded to a general and fatal epidemic, &ldquo;the Plague<lb/>
or as killing a disease,&rdquo; noted by Ligon (1673), in Barbados in the au-</p>
<pb n="153" id="Cb000169"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
153</p>
<p>tumn of 1647. There is nothing to show that this was yellow fever,<lb/>
unless the locality, enabling us to exclude malaria, the most usual epi-<lb/>
demic in the tropics, be itself suspicious, and the statements by both<lb/>
Ligon and Scott that the case mortality was decidedly greater among<lb/> 
men than among women. This island was much used by English vessels,<lb/>
apparently of all classes, as a port of call and for refitting, etc.</p>
<p>More than Barbados at this time was St. Christophe, the present St.<lb/>
Kitts, a resort for both English and French filibusters. If we follow<lb/>
P&eacute;re du Tertre, the historian of the early French settlements of Guade-<lb/>
loupe and Martinique, there was a severe epidemic of yellow fever at St.<lb/> 
Christophe prior and up to July, 1648. &ldquo;During this same year, 1648,<lb/>
the &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>,&rsquo; until then unknown in these islands since they were inhabited<lb/>
by the French, was brought here by some vessels; it began at St. Chris-<lb/>
tophe, and in the eighteen months it lasted it carried away nearly one-<lb/>
third of the inhabitants.&rdquo; It was brought to Guadeloupe by a vessel of<lb/>
la Rochelle, called <hi rend="italic">Le Boeuf</hi>. She arrived at Basse Terre, Guadeloupe,<lb/>
with men sick and dying aboard, and P&eacute;re Armande de la Paix, the<lb/>
Superior of the Jesuit Missions of the French Islands, went aboard her<lb/>
&ldquo;to confess and to serve them.&rdquo; He contracted the disease and died on<lb/>
August 4, St. Dominic's Day. The vessel should, then, have arrived<lb/>
at Guadeloupe (Basse Terre) in late July--a few days before or after<lb/>
July 25 (du Tertre, 1667-71, vol. 1, pp. 421-22).</p>
<p>Of the symptoms of this disease, as seen at Guadeloupe, du Tertre<lb/>
writes that it &ldquo;caused in those who were attacked by it a very violent<lb/>
headache, a general weakness of all the limbs&rdquo; (prostration), &ldquo;and<lb/>
continual vomiting, so that in three days it would send a man to his<lb/>
grave.&rdquo; We have no description of this &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; as it prevailed in St.<lb/>
Christophe.<hi rend="superscript">10</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">10</hi> Both P&eacute;re Pelleprat (1655) and the historian of the Jesuit missions in the<lb/>
French Antilles and Guianas (1857) give accounts (that of the latter based on<lb/>
Pelleprat's narrative) of an epidemic sickness at St. Christophe in 1652 and 1653,<lb/>
associated with so great a scarcity of food as almost to merit the designation of<lb/>
famine. No description of the disease is given, save that it was communicable,<lb/>
fatal, and general over the island. One priest died of it and another barely<lb/>
escaped with his life. Pelleprat went to St. Christophe in 1651 from Guadeloupe,<lb/>
and does not mention any previous sickness in St. Christophe. Of the two con-<lb/>
current calamities, he evidently considered the scarcity of food (<hi rend="italic">disette</hi>) the more<lb/>
serious, and it is not unlikely that a severe epidemic of yellow fever, &ldquo;taking off<lb/>
one third of the population&rdquo; in 1648, would have produced a great scarcity of pro-<lb/>
visions--a thing not unusual in St. Christophe--for a year or so afterwards, while<lb/>
a recrudescence of the fever, possible from the arrival of newcomers, would not<lb/>
be very serious, there not being enough susceptible material for an epidemic.<lb/>
There was, however, unquestionably a sickness, fatal, considered communicable,<lb/>
and fairly general, at St. Christophe with this famine in 1652 and 1653.</p>

<p>The regions of America which we have already examined for the pre-<lb/>
Columbian existence of yellow fever are those which are most generally<lb/>
--we think universally--accused by the advocates of the American<lb/>
origin of the disease, and are unquestionably those which at that time<lb/>
gave the best conditions, climatic and sociological, for being perma-<lb/>
nent endemic centers of that infection. Yet it seems advisable to exam-<lb/>
ine such other regions of America in which the pre-Columbian--or at<lb/>
least very early--existence of yellow fever has also been claimed.</p>
<p>ARGUMENT OF FINLAY, B&Eacute;RENGER-F&Eacute;RAUD, AND OTHERS</p>
<p>The protagonists for the American origin of yellow fever have been,<lb/>
in chronological order: Moreau de Jonn&egrave;s, Cornilliac, Finlay, and B&eacute;ren-<lb/>
ger-F&eacute;raud, the last two writing at about the same time. All four<lb/>
believed that yellow fever occurred early in Hispaniola (&ldquo;Espa&ntilde;ola&rdquo;),<lb/>
causing the great mortality during the &ldquo;hunger&rdquo; which followed the<lb/>
battle of Vega Real, March 24, 1495. The first two writers believed<lb/>
it endemic in this island prior to the arrival of the Spaniards (1492).<lb/>
Their belief, which was general at that time, was that the cause of yel-<lb/>
low fever was a telluric emanation or an organism locally saprophytic,<lb/>
but facultatively parasitic to man, producing the disease in susceptible<lb/>
men exposed to it, but existing in places under the above conditions<lb/>
independently of its manifestation among men; and existing indefinitely<lb/>
unless destroyed by some agency such as frost, fire, etc. They would<lb/>
probably, then, have held that the cause of the infection of yellow fever<lb/>
was <hi rend="italic">produced</hi> in Hispaniola by local telluric and climatic conditions,<lb/>
independently of its population, in geologic times.</p>
<p>Finlay, however, believed that it was introduced in 1495 by the Caribs<lb/>
from the Lesser Antilles or the mainland, Hispaniola having been previ-<lb/>
ously free from it. Prior to this, there had been much sickness with a<lb/>
number of deaths among the Spaniards, and the sickness was markedly<lb/>
increased during the famine; but Finlay was compelled to his belief<lb/>
that the disease was newly introduced into the island by the fact that<lb/>
the sickness and mortality among the Indians in the outbreak of 1495<lb/>
were greater even than among the Spaniards. The fact that no yellow<lb/>
154<lb/>
<pb n="155" id="Cb000171"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
155<lb/>
fever, or other malignant disease, was reported in the Carib Islands<lb/>
(the Little Antilles and Porto Rico) or in the Guianas, when first settled<lb/>
by Europeans, renders this view improbable. Nor, if yellow fever<lb/>
existed among the Caribs, is it clear why it should not have been intro-<lb/>
duced into Hispaniola earlier. The Carib settlement (Higuey) on its<lb/>
south coast, while not an original Carib seat, was over a generation old<lb/>
when Columbus came and was presumably in ordinary communication<lb/>
with the other Caribs. Yellow fever might, of course, have been in-<lb/>
troduced earlier, have died out from failure of the human host, and have<lb/>
been accidentally reintroduced; but one knows no special reason why<lb/>
this should have happened just at that time, although, if the disease<lb/>
were introduced at that time, the sociological perturbation caused by<lb/>
the coming of the Spaniards would have caused it to be more readily<lb/>
propagated.</p>
<p>SICKNESS IN COLUMBUS' COLONY</p>
<p>There was sickness in Hispaniola from the beginning. Soon after<lb/>
Columbus' colony landed, December, 1493, &ldquo;the people began suddenly<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">de golpe</hi>) to fall sick and, for the little coolness that they had, to die<lb/>
also many of them so that scarcely remained a man of the hidalgos, or of<lb/>
the plebians, however robust he might be, who did not fall sick of the<lb/>
terrible <hi rend="italic">calenturas</hi>. . . . . Nor <hi rend="italic">did the Admiral</hi> escape.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> This from<lb/>
Las Casas (vol. 2, p. 22). Herrera gives practically the same account.<lb/>
Dr. Chanca, the physician of the expedition and an eye-witness, in a<lb/>
letter to the Cabildo of Sevilla, reports the same prevalence of sickness,<lb/>
but clearly does not consider it to be generally of a severe character:<lb/>
&ldquo;One third of them sick. . . but I hope in Our Lord that all will be raised up<lb/>
in health.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Columbus, too, witnesses to the prevalence of this sickness,<lb/>
but is inclined to belittle its severity. In a letter to the Sovereigns of<lb/>
Spain, dated January 30, 1494, explaining why he is not sending more<lb/>
gold by Torres, who sailed February 2, 1494, he says: . . . . &ldquo;of the<lb/>
people, who here are ours, the greater part suddenly fell sick,&rdquo; but<lb/>
&ldquo;Confiding in the mercy of God,&rdquo; he believes that &ldquo;this people will<lb/>
convalesce very soon, as already it is doing (<hi rend="italic">ya lo hace</hi>) and immediately</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Columbus was sick again, and much more severely, from a &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;nearly<lb/>
deprived of his senses,&rdquo; some months later aboard ship off Mona. There was no<lb/>
other sickness recorded as occurring on the vessel. Finlay is inclined to consider<lb/>
this yellow fever. I would be glad to if I could. For Columbus to be the first<lb/>
European to have yellow fever would be at least dramatic.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Antonio del Monte y Tejada, <hi rend="italic">Historia de Santo Domingo</hi>, 1853, p. 298.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>. . . . if they had some fresh meat in order to strengthen them, very soon<lb/>
all would be on their feet with the aid of God, and even the most are<lb/>
already convalesced in this time,&rdquo; and adds that he is purposing to build<lb/>
a wall around the settlement &ldquo;with these men as they get well and the<lb/>
few who remain well&rdquo; (Del Monte, p. 257).<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> His memorandum to<lb/>
Torres, too, gives: &ldquo;Say to their highnesses, as it is said,&rdquo; (in the above<lb/>
letter) &ldquo;that the cause of these sicknesses, so general of all, is the change<lb/>
of water and airs, because we see that it extends to all successively and<lb/>
they endanger few (<hi rend="italic">peligran pocos</hi>).&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">4</hi></p>
<p>The work on the wall of Isabela was not stopped. The men, &ldquo;hidalgos<lb/>
and common men (<hi rend="italic">gente de trabajo</hi>), and even men of black capes<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">capas prietas--courtiers</hi>), being driven to the work with violence,&rdquo;<lb/>
by the Admiral, &ldquo;in spite of sickness and weakness from sickness.&rdquo;<lb/>
Finlay is unquestionably right. This was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yellow fever!</p>
<p>SECOND EPIDEMIC, 1495</p>
<p>Later, especially after the food became scarce, the sickness increased<lb/>
in severity. Food became scarce rather early, and at times very scarce,<lb/>
it being noted in March, 1494, that there was no more flour. The provi-<lb/>
sions brought from Spain got wet and spoiled. They were too many<lb/>
(1,300, says Del Monte) to live off the country, nor were they generally<lb/>
the class of men suited to found a self-supporting colony, there being<lb/>
many hidalgos, courtiers, and adventurers. Also, unfortunately, gold<lb/>
was discovered in some of the streams, though at a distance of 20 leagues<lb/>
from the settlement, and the search for this lessened the inclination of<lb/>
the company to the agriculture so necessary for sustaining the colony.<lb/>
The mortality from the sickness increased as time passed. The scarcity<lb/>
culminated in the famine of 1495, and with it the sickness, or at least the<lb/>
severity of the sickness.</p>
<p>The Indians, after their defeat at Vega Real, March 24, 1495, de-<lb/>
stroyed their crops and planted no more, with the intention to drive out<lb/>
the Spaniards by famine,<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> &ldquo;they themselves taking to the woods and</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Navarrete (vol. i, p. 225 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>) also gives this letter.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Chanca regarded the bad voyage (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mala pasada del camino</hi>&rdquo;) as a factor in<lb/>
this sickness, and it may be that there was a substratum of scurvy to it. Scurvy<lb/>
was not then recognized as a disease. The first note of it was of its appearance in<lb/>
Vasco da Gama's voyage of 1597-1598.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> &ldquo;Not knowing the quality of Spaniards, that as their hunger increased, so<lb/>
much the more did their tenacity, and the more they suffer the harder they are to<lb/>
make suffer&rdquo; (Las Casas, vol. ii, p. 105).</p>
<pb n="157" id="Cb000173"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>

<p>living on wild things,&rdquo; such animals as they could find, mainly rodents<lb/>
and reptiles, wild fruits and roots. The Spaniards were less able to do<lb/>
this than the Indians, &ldquo;not knowing what to eat and eating hurtful<lb/>
things,&rdquo; and they suffered greatly. By this famine and the sickness<lb/>
accompanying it, both Las Casas and Herrera state that more than<lb/>
one-third of the Indians died.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi></p>
<p>As to the nature of this second epidemic, the <hi rend="italic">sequelae</hi> of this sickness<lb/>
presented in the men returning to Spain, on which the French writers<lb/>
rely for their diagnosis of yellow fever, are given on page 74 of Part II,<lb/>
and, as there stated, indicate malaria, not yellow fever. Finlay bases<lb/>
his opinion that it was yellow fever on the mortality among the colonists.<lb/>
This was unquestionably heavy. Of the 1,500 who had come with<lb/>
Columbus in 1493, only 300 remained in 1502, a loss of 80 per cent in<lb/>
nine years. Del Monte, in general more accurate than Las Casas, from<lb/>
whom this figure is taken, gives the number in 1493 as 1,300, which<lb/>
would make the loss a little less than 77 per cent.</p>
<p>SUBSEQUENT HISTORY OF HISPANTOLA</p>
<p>With Ovando, in 1502, came 2,500 men who &ldquo;hastened into the mines<lb/>
to collect gold&rdquo;--&ldquo;a new work to them&rdquo;--and &ldquo;on account of fatigues,<lb/>
lack of food, and the heat, they took sicknesses and fevers and more than<lb/>
1,000 of them died,&rdquo; that is, 40 per cent of these newcomers. These<lb/>
losses are heavy, but considering the difference in climate and the<lb/>
severity of the famine, the loss is, if anything, less than at Jamestown;<lb/>
and it does not seem necessary to introduce yellow fever to explain it.<lb/>
In Hispaniola <hi rend="italic">Anopheles</hi> would be functionally active the whole year; in<lb/>
Jamestown not over four and a half months, at most.</p>
<p>Las Casas is the only writer who ascribes any considerable number of<lb/>
deaths of these Spaniards to violence. He says some were killed by<lb/>
fighting among themselves over Indian women; some by the Indians for<lb/>
the same cause. Many went off into the interior with women--&ldquo;even<lb/>
with two women,&rdquo; he records with horror--and did not return. &ldquo;Nor<lb/>
did they return who, looking for gold, went into the territory of Caon-<lb/>
abo.&rdquo; The other historians give instances of small parties, looking for<lb/>
gold, etc., cut off in this latter district, inhabited by Caribs. It would,<lb/>
I think, be a proportionately small number, however.</p>
<p>Later, Isabela was moved to a less marshy site--which would not have</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">6</hi> In early Spanish writings nearly all epidemics in the Americas are reported as<lb/>
&ldquo;carrying off one-third of the people&rdquo;--no other fraction is ever used. The same<lb/>
is true, though not so universally, in the early French accounts.</p>
<pb n="158" id="Cb000174"/>
<p>158<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>affected yellow fever--and we hear little of its unhealthfulness, even to<lb/>
newcomers. At no time prior to 1649 is any mention made of epidemics<lb/>
on vessels in the harbor, or going therefrom, or in expeditions, like those<lb/>
of Ojeda, Nicuesa, or Montejo, stopping there some little while. The<lb/>
absence of reports of epidemic sickness on shipboard seems, to the<lb/>
writer, significant.</p>
<p>There seems, then, no sufficient ground to believe that Hispaniola,<lb/>
or places in contaminative communication therewith, were infected<lb/>
with yellow fever at the time of the discovery of America, or indeed until<lb/>
long afterwards.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi></p>
<p>No one has predicated the existence of yellow fever in any of the<lb/>
Greater Antilles except Hispaniola at the time of their settlement by<lb/>
Europeans; and indeed Finlay, the most earnest and erudite of the<lb/>
advocates of the American origin of yellow fever, is very definite in<lb/>
asserting its absence from them.<hi rend="superscript">8</hi> Hence, to discuss the history of the<lb/>
discovery and settlement of these other islands, in which the writer<lb/>
cannot find one iota of evidence for the existence of yellow fever, would<lb/>
seem like defending a position not attacked--the destruction of a man<lb/>
of straw.</p>
<p>The above, taken with the fact that after the elimination of Havana<lb/>
as a permanent endemic focus, yellow fever spontaneously disappeared<lb/>
from all of the West Indies, although these islands had then a larger<lb/>
population and more communication among themselves and with the<lb/>
outside world than in pre-Columbian times, is, the writer thinks, suffi-<lb/>
cient to exonerate them from having been a permanent endemic focus<lb/>
in pre-Columbian days.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> It may be somewhat significant that the mortality was high among the negroes<lb/>
Saco (1879, <hi rend="italic">Historia de la Esclavitud de la Raza Africana en el Nuevo Mundo</hi>, page<lb/>
67) quotes a letter from the King (in Munoz' &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Colecci&oacute;n</hi>&rdquo;) to one, Sampier, in<lb/>
Hispaniola, dated Seville, June 21, 1511: &ldquo;I do not understand why so many blacks<lb/>
have died&rdquo; (in Hispaniola). &ldquo;Care for them much.&rdquo; They were later very<lb/>
healthy--&ldquo;not dying except when hung.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">8</hi> &ldquo;From this we deduce that before the discovery, yellow fever was endemic in<lb/>
the coasts of the <hi rend="italic">Tierra-firme</hi> and in those of the sea of the North of New Spain&rdquo;<lb/>
(Mexico), &ldquo;but not in the islands of Santo Domingo, Jamaica, Cuba, nor probably<lb/>
in Porto Rico nor in Trinidad; but that in the first of these islands, Santo Domingo,<lb/>
the sickness was imported in the years 1494 or 1495&rdquo; (Finlay, 1912, p. 121).</p>

<head>THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA: EXPEDITIONS OF OJEDA AND NICUESA</head>
<pb n="159" id="Cb000175"/>
<p>Both Finlay and B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud lay greater stress on the early<lb/>
existence of yellow fever on the <hi rend="italic">tierra firme</hi> than in Hispaniola, and for<lb/>
this they rely on the history of the expeditions of Ojeda and Nicuesa to<lb/>
the Caribbean coast of Colombia and Panama. They base their belief<lb/>
on the statement that the men in these expeditions were newcomers from<lb/>
Spain and suffered great, indeed excessive, losses from sickness during<lb/>
these expeditions, while in the same regions there were practically no<lb/>
losses at all among the men with Balboa, consisting of the veterans of<lb/>
these expeditions and men recruited in Hispaniola; and that later,<lb/>
when a large body of men directly from Spain settled in the region in<lb/>
which Balboa's force had been enjoying good health, they again suffered<lb/>
heavy losses from sickness.</p>
<p>If the facts are as stated, it is unquestionably an allowable deduction<lb/>
that the sickness was one of which one attack on the Isthmus had pro-<lb/>
duced immunity, and that those resident in Santo Domingo were<lb/>
immune by previous attack of the same disease in Santo Domingo. Let<lb/>
us examine the facts.</p>
<p>HISTORICAL AUTHORITIES</p>
<p>Rather full accounts of these expeditions are given by Herrera, Las<lb/>
Casas, and Oviedo. Although agreeing in general, they differ in many<lb/>
details. There are a few side-lights also from other sources, as in<lb/>
Navarrete's <hi rend="italic">Colecci&oacute;n</hi> of original documents of Spanish discovery,<lb/>
etc.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Herrera</hi> was the official historiographer of the Spanish Court for the<lb/>
New World. He thus had access to all official documents; and from<lb/>
them, and with much classical and ecclesiastical learning, his history is<lb/>
written. His dates, then, are doubtless authoritative (few are given by<lb/>
either of the others), as are the broad features that would be given in such<lb/>
papers. If, however, the official documents of this period, as given in<lb/>
Navarrete's <hi rend="italic">Colecci&oacute;n</hi> and In <hi rend="italic">Los Documentos In&eacute;ditos del Ultramar</hi>,<lb/>
are a criterion, one wonders where he got the detailed data for some of<lb/>
his dramatic descriptions, as of affairs on Escudo Island or of the<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>&rdquo; at Darien.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Las Casas</hi> was in Santo Domingo (Hispaniola) when these expeditions<lb/>
outfitted there in the autumn of 1509. Of this he says: &ldquo;I saw what I<lb/>
have related (<hi rend="italic">yo vid&eacute; lo que he contado</hi>).&rdquo; He is authority, then, and the<lb/>
only eye-witness for what occurred there. He was never on the Isthmus<lb/>
of Panama, the scene of these expeditions, and could scarcely have had<lb/>
good opportunity of getting information directly from the men who<lb/>
took part in them. Moreover, his account of them was written in 1559,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi><lb/>
forty-nine years later, when he was eighty-five years of age, long enough<lb/>
after the events and he old enough for any supplementing of records<lb/>
by memory to be of doubtful reliability. The frequent identity of<lb/>
passages in his book with those in Herrera's, and their very general<lb/>
agreement in the number of men lost on different occasions by these<lb/>
expeditions,<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> leads one to infer that he had access to Herrera's manu-<lb/>
script, or it may be, only to the same documents from which Herrera's<lb/>
was written. He was in Spain from 1547 to 1566, when he died. He<lb/>
was in Spain, then, when he wrote this, and frequently, in his capacity<lb/>
of &ldquo;Protector of the Indians,&rdquo; went to Court and appeared before the<lb/>
Council of the Indies, from the records of which Herrera was writing.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi><lb/>
He makes several allusions, all disparaging, to &ldquo;what Oviedo has written,&rdquo;<lb/>
asserting that it &ldquo;contains as many lies as pages,&rdquo; and had evidently<lb/>
seen the greater part of his book. As Part 1 of Oviedo's work was pub-<lb/>
lished in 1535, and Part II with Part I revised, in 1547, he may well have<lb/>
done so. Also a &ldquo;Summary Report&rdquo; of Oviedo's history had been<lb/>
published at Toledo in 1526, covering, naturally, only so much of it as<lb/>
was then written.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Oviedo</hi> enjoyed some peculiar advantages for his task. He was<lb/>
brought up at the Spanish Court and later served on the staff of &ldquo;the<lb/>
Great Captain,&rdquo; Gonsalvo de Cordova, in Italy. He was early inter-<lb/>
ested in the New World and says that he &ldquo;formed the intention&rdquo; to<lb/>
write this history in 1493, being then 15 years old. The Spanish Court<lb/>
was then the center of information on the Indies, and his privileged<lb/>
position--he was groom of the chamber and friend to Don Juan of<lb/>
Austria--gave him access to the men who had this information. He<lb/>
mentions and quotes Peter Martyr, with whom Columbus carried on a<lb/>
personal correspondence during, and concerning, his earlier voyages.</p>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
161</p>
<p>He first went to the New World with the expedition of Pedrarias, and<lb/>
landed at Darien June 30, 1514, only three and a half years after Nicuesa<lb/>
left that place to his death. He was stationed in this government for a<lb/>
number of years, representing the King as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Veedor de las fundiciones del<lb/>
Oro</hi> (Inspector of the Productions of Gold) <hi rend="italic">de la Tierra Firme</hi>,&rdquo; and was<lb/>
a thorn in the flesh to Pedrarias. A little later he served here in addition<lb/>
as Supervisor of the Clerks of the Judicial Records, representing Lope<lb/>
(de) Conchillos, &ldquo;the Secretary.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">4</hi></p>
<p>Oviedo evidently, then, was in the region covered by these expeditions<lb/>
soon after they were made and, although not an eye-witness, had oppor-<lb/>
tunities of talking with a number of those who took part in them, and<lb/>
who were still at Darien and Nombre de Dios. He would have been<lb/>
induced to seek information at first hand by his interest in New World<lb/>
affairs; and the fact that he was a soldier would make it easy for him to<lb/>
approach and to win the confidence of the Spanish soldiers engaged in the<lb/>
expeditions, while his knowledge of the men, and, to an extent, of Ameri-<lb/>
can affairs, would help him to separate the true from the false in their<lb/>
tales. Again, there is intrinsic evidence in this history that he did get<lb/>
such information directly from men who had been on these expeditions<lb/>
--for instance, giving the number of corpses counted in the pile of<lb/>
dead at Matarap and the statement that they were swollen from the<lb/>
poisoned arrows; that the leaf in which Nicuesa's note was found wrapped<lb/>
was an &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">annato leaf</hi>;&rdquo; that the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">almendras</hi>&rdquo; eaten on the island were,<lb/>
from the description, not that nut but &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">caperas</hi>;&rdquo; the account of the<lb/>
&ldquo;assiduous&rdquo; hound with Nicuesa's party following the deer into the sea<lb/>
and bringing it back by the ear; giving the name (&ldquo;Leon&ccedil;ico&rdquo;) of<lb/>
Vasco Nu&ntilde;ez' dog; that he &ldquo;had seen and had read the oath&rdquo; to forbid<lb/>
Nicuesa's landing, &ldquo;subscribed to&rdquo; in the church of San Sebastian at<lb/>
Darien, and &ldquo;afterwards was acquainted with the most of the sub-<lb/>
scribers.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">5</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Of the Council of the Indies, one thinks. Orders of this Council are signed<lb/>

<p>His official position on the <hi rend="italic">tierra firme</hi> gave him probably as free<lb/>

them in other ways, he frequently having direct access to the informa-<lb/>
tion on which such documents were based.</p>
<p>Oviedo must also have revised his work very carefully, as inconsisten-<lb/>
cies are practically absent from it, while they are common with Las<lb/>
Casas, and occur occasionally with Herrera. One cannot but consider<lb/>
that this part of Oviedo's <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi>--whatever may be said of some of<lb/>
that relating to the conquest of Mexico--is by far the most reliable<lb/>
and authoritative account that we have; and it is, in general, the one<lb/>
followed in this paper. It is really a great history.</p>
<p>However, as has been said, all three historians are in general agree-<lb/>
ment as to these expeditions. In the details, the two ecclesiastics seem<lb/>
inclined to stress the horrific, and indeed the sensational accounts which<lb/>
they give of the sufferings of the men of these expeditions (mainly from<lb/>
hunger) and their hysterical reactions thereto, make one believe that<lb/>
there is an element of imagination mixed with the historical data which<lb/>
they had. Their accounts of the behavior of the Spanish soldier under<lb/>
stress are entirely different from those given by military eye-witnesses<lb/>
such as Bernal Diaz.</p>

have been written by Balboa himself, so vivid and so sympathetic is the picture<lb/>
it presents, and so full and artistic the detail necessary to make it so. That some<lb/>
of the historian's informaton was directly from Balboa is evidenced by the not<lb/>
infrequent occurrence in his book of the phrase, &ldquo;thus was it said by Vasco<lb/>
Nu&ntilde;ez.&rdquo; Oviedo greatly admired Balboa and rightly considered the discovery<lb/>
of the &ldquo;Sea of the South,&rdquo; next to that of Columbus, the most important one<lb/>
made in the New World.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">6</hi> He states: &ldquo;All the writings of Vasco Nu&ntilde;ez came before me (<hi rend="italic">&aacute; mi poder</hi>)&rdquo;--<lb/>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
163</p>
<p>point west to Cabo Gracias &agrave; Dios in Honduras. The Province of<lb/>
Veragua, in the western part of the present Republic of Panama, was<lb/>
included in Nicuesa's territory, although it had been previously as-<lb/>
signed to Columbus and his heirs. The joint use of Jamaica, for pro-<lb/>
visioning and as a source for slaves, was also granted. This, too, had<lb/>
been discovered by and assigned to Columbus, and both this island and<lb/>
Veragua were claimed by Diego Columbus, the son of the Admiral, then<lb/>
resident as <hi rend="italic">Adelantado</hi> in Santo Domingo. He, then, bitterly resented<lb/>
this new assignment.</p>
<p>Juan de la Cosa, a pilot of high repute in American waters, was<lb/>
appointed by the King second in command in Ojeda's expedition. He<lb/>
soon arrived at Santo Domingo from Spain with 200 men, one ship and<lb/>
two brigantines, for Ojeda, who was already there.</p>
<p>Nicuesa arrived a few days later and, &ldquo;because he was rich,&rdquo; he had a<lb/>
larger fleet, four large ships and two brigantines, &ldquo;and a greater equip-<lb/>
ment for men.&rdquo; He had stopped en route at the island of Santa Cruz<lb/>
and kidnapped one hundred or more Carib Indians to sell as slaves in<lb/>
Santo Domingo.</p>
<p>Both Ojeda and Nicuesa enlisted men in Santo Domingo to fill out<lb/>
their complements, purchased horses, and outfitted generally for the ex-<lb/>
peditions. There was considerable bickering between them, about their<lb/>
boundaries and other matters; and the <hi rend="italic">Adelantado</hi>, Diego Columbus, put<lb/>
as many obstacles in their way as possible, having Nicuesa arrested, for<lb/>
debts and pretended debts, at least three times, and very nearly suc-<lb/>
ceeding in preventing his sailing at all. He did succeed in holding Ojeda<lb/>
until the <hi rend="italic">Adelantado</hi> had himself outfitted an expedition, under Esquivel,<lb/>
for the settlement of Jamaica, thus to sustain his claim to that island.</p>
<p>Ojeda finally sailed for the <hi rend="italic">tierra firme</hi> November 10, 1509, with 300<lb/>
men and 12 horses. Before leaving, he had arranged with the Bachelor<lb/>
Enciso, a wealthy lawyer, to enlist more men, fit out another vessel, and<lb/>
follow him some months later with provisions and reinforcements.</p>
<p>Nicuesa also recruited men in Santo Domingo and &ldquo;because he had<lb/>
the greater armada and was gracious of manner and well liked, and<lb/>
Veragua&rdquo; (where he intended to settle) &ldquo;was regarded as much richer<lb/>
in gold than Uraba, he raised many island-men (<hi rend="italic">isle&ntilde;os</hi>),&rdquo; more than<lb/>
Ojeda, &ldquo;so that, in addition to the ships he brought from Spain, he had<lb/>
to buy another.&rdquo; He sailed November 22, according to Las Casas,<lb/>
with 700 men and six horses,<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> having made the same arrangement with</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> He is accredited later, by Colmenares, when speaking of his losses at Nombre<lb/>

<p>Rodrigo de Colmenares as Ojeda had with Enciso, and having appointed<lb/>
him as lieutenant, or at least so Colmenares stated after Nicuesa was<lb/>
dead (Navarrete, vol. 3, p. 386).</p>
<p>Ojedo obviously added 100 men to his quota in Santo Domingo.<lb/>
How many Nicuesa added we do not know. It was more than Ojeda's,<lb/>
and, from the increase in his armada, should have been considerably<lb/>
more. Colmenares states of Nicuesa's party: &ldquo;they sought to raise 400<lb/>
men in this island of Santo Domingo,&rdquo; but we do not know that they<lb/>
succeeded. &ldquo;He enlisted very many people in this island,&rdquo; says Las<lb/>
Casas, who was on the ground. Places on these two expeditions were<lb/>
evidently eagerly sought by men in Santo Domingo. Pizarro joined<lb/>
Ojeda, Cortez would have gone with them but for a swelling on his leg,<lb/>
and Balboa followed with Colmenares. Clearly, then, the first allega-<lb/>
tion of Finlay and B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud, that the personnel of these expedi-<lb/>
tions were men new-come from Spain, is measurably true, but not<lb/>
entirely so. The basis, and doubtless the majority of them, were new-<lb/>
comers, but there were a considerable number recruited in Santo<lb/>
Domingo.</p>
<p>There is no mention of any sickness among these men at Santo Do-<lb/>
mingo or en route to the <hi rend="italic">tierra firme</hi>. There is no record of how long<lb/>
they stayed in Santo Domingo; but from the preparations they had to<lb/>
make there, and the trouble with the <hi rend="italic">Adelantado</hi>, it was probably some<lb/>
weeks. The voyage itself was only a matter of four or five days, says<lb/>
Las Casas. Let us follow their history.</p>
<p>OJEDA'S EXPEDITION</p>
<p>Ojeda arrived off Cartagena and prepared to land. Juan de la Cosa<lb/>
advised him not to do so at this place, but to make his settlement &ldquo;on the<lb/>
right side&rdquo; of the Gulf of Uraba, which, of course, would have been in<lb/>
Nicuesa's concession, &ldquo;because the Indians on this side were very savage,<lb/>
skilled archers, and used poisoned arrows,&rdquo; implying that this was not<lb/>
true of those on the other side of the Gulf, which indeed was correct, this<lb/>
Gulf marking the western limits of the Carib country. Moreover,</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>nection, Las Casas and Herrera say 785. Yet in their accounts of his setting<lb/>
out, both Herrera and Las Casas put his force at 700, and the latter says: &ldquo;I saw<lb/>
what I have related.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a detailed account of the distribution of his force the day after he reached<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">tierra firme</hi>, after stating that none had been lost at this time, Oviedo gives the<lb/>
total as 650, and this is believed to be correct as the number that sailed from Santo<lb/>
Domingo with him.</p>
<pb n="165" id="Cb000181"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
165</p>
<p>&ldquo;they were irritated against the Christians, as they had been ill treated<lb/>
by Christobal de Guerra.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">8</hi></p>
<p>Ojeda, however, landed where he first intended, attacked, and cap-<lb/>
tured with little resistance, a small pueblo of the Indians (&ldquo;Pueblo de las<lb/>
Ollas,&rdquo; Oviedo calls it; Herrera and Las Casas give other names). No<lb/>
account is given of his losses in so doing, but it is related that &ldquo;some of<lb/>
ours were wounded by arrows&rdquo; before they could capture a cabin from<lb/>
which some bowmen were fighting,<hi rend="superscript">9</hi> and that four were wounded by the<lb/>
arrows of an Indian Amazon of sixteen to eighteen years. Probably<lb/>
some of the wounded died. Las Casas states that some were killed<lb/>
here, but gives no number.</p>
<p>Following this, Ojeda marched about twelve miles inland to attack a<lb/>
large pueblo, called &ldquo;Matarap&rdquo; by Oviedo; &ldquo;Yurbaco&rdquo; and &ldquo;Turbaco&rdquo;<lb/>
by Herrera and Las Casas, respectively. Having made camp carelessly,<lb/>
he was surprised, beaten, and driven back to his landing place. His loss<lb/>
in killed is given by Oviedo as &ldquo;up to 100 men and . . . . Juan de la<lb/>
Cosa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Las Casas and Herrera state that every wound by the poisoned arrows<lb/>
of the Caribs, no matter how slight, &ldquo;even a pin-prick,&rdquo; so blood was<lb/>
drawn, was fatal. However, Oviedo, a soldier, says he has seen cases<lb/>
recover when the poison was no longer fresh. It must have been fairly<lb/>
fatal, however, for of 47 of Colmenares' men wounded by arrows at<lb/>
Santa Marta it is stated that only one escaped death (Las Casas).</p>
<p>Next day Nicuesa appeared, and with 300 of his men and &ldquo;some&rdquo;<lb/>
of Ojeda's, the attack on Matarap was renewed. The pueblo was sur-<lb/>
prised before dawn and taken. There is no note of any loss to Ojeda<lb/>
in this attack, and there probably was none, as Oviedo states that only<lb/>
three of Nicuesa's men were wounded by arrows and that none died.<lb/>
It is here that he speaks of the occasional recovery from wounds with<lb/>
Carib arrows.<hi rend="superscript">10</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">8</hi> La Cosa spoke from first-hand knowledge of this. Monroy, with one vessel,<lb/>
had been wrecked here, and de Guerra and la Cosa, who had gone to his rescue with<lb/>
two vessels, were also wrecked and with more than 50 men remained, marooned, on<lb/>
this coast for two and a half years. Both the above were slave-seeking expeditions,<lb/>
and these were not the only ones. Some &ldquo;irritation,&rdquo; then, was not unnatural.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">9</hi> Oviedo says some pieces of gold had been placed before it, knowing the desire<lb/>
of the Spaniards for that metal--i.e. as bait.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">10</hi> Herrera and Las Casas both give Ojeda's loss in his defeat at 70 men, but I<lb/>
have thought it safest to follow Oviedo, partly for the reasons previously given,<lb/>
and partly because he notes that in the captured pueblo &ldquo;there were counted 80<lb/>
corpses of Spaniards&rdquo; in a pile, &ldquo;all swollen by the poison of the arrows.&rdquo; Evi-</p>
<pb n="166" id="Cb000182"/>
<p>166<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>Nicuesa left at once for Veragua, allowing his men to take none of the<lb/>
plunder from the captured town. He had stayed on Ojeda's territory<lb/>
only about thirty-six hours.</p>
<p>Ojeda, still in Carib country, constructed a fort of &ldquo;thick timbers,&rdquo; a<lb/>
stockade, one judges, and built huts, thirty or more, therein. This he<lb/>
dedicated to St. Sebastian, whose protection he sought against the<lb/>
Carib bowmen with their poisoned arrows. Making a raid therefrom,<lb/>
for gold, against a <hi rend="italic">cacique</hi> named Tirufi, he was defeated and followed<lb/>
back to the fort. In this fight, says Las Casas, &ldquo;many of Ojeda's men,<lb/>
wounded by arrows, died raving.&rdquo; Food having become very scarce, he<lb/>
made another sortie to obtain some, but &ldquo;his attack was met by arrows<lb/>
like rain and he was routed and followed until the gates of the fort were<lb/>
shut . . . . and they had hard work therein to bury the dead and to<lb/>
care for the wounded and the few who escaped the deadly poison.&rdquo; 
(Las Casas).</p>
<p>Some time later, nearly starving, and &ldquo;some sick from eating harmful<lb/>
things,&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">11</hi> they made another sally, again to meet with defeat and pur-<lb/>
suit to the very gate of the fortress. In this Ojeda was wounded. His<lb/>
recovery is ascribed to burning out the poison with a bar of white-hot<lb/>
iron; but as he was shot through the calf of his leg, his raw-hide leggings<lb/>
may have wiped the poison from the point of the arrow. Hereafter, he<lb/>
and his men stayed in this fort, &ldquo;not daring to go out of the fortress a<lb/>
step to seek provisions, because they were severely punished (<hi rend="italic">escarmen</hi>-</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>dently this is an account he received from an eye-witness. Also, though of less<lb/>
weight, he quotes Ojeda, as if verbatim, telling Nicuesa: &ldquo;I have lost Juan de la<lb/>
Cosa and 100 of my best men.&rdquo; Note, too, that only some of Ojeda's men joined<lb/>
in the second attack on Matarap, Nicuesa furnishing 300. It would seem then,<lb/>
that Ojeda had not over 200 men remaining, for some of those wounded by poi-<lb/>
soned arrows at the Pueblo de Ollas had probably died.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">11</hi> Through all the early accounts of great scarcities of food and the accompany-<lb/>
ing sicknesses among the Spaniards in the New World, runs the belief that much<lb/>
of the latter was due to &ldquo;eating harmful things&rdquo;--i.e. poisons. One is inclined to<lb/>
accept this with considerable reserve, yet along with a number of edible fruits,<lb/>
seeds, roots, etc., growing wild in the American tropics, there are others which are<lb/>
poisonous; e.g. the <hi rend="italic">manzanillo</hi>, which has rather a pleasant taste; <hi rend="italic">per as del mar</hi>,<lb/>
which no man in his senses would eat; <hi rend="italic">pi&ntilde;as bravas; ca&ntilde;a fistula</hi>, something like the<lb/>
fruit of the honey locust; the root of the wild cassava, etc.; and it may be that some<lb/>
credence should be given to these statements. Dampier tells of a rather whole-<lb/>
sale poisoning of a party of buccaneers, in 1681, by eating <hi rend="italic">manzanillos</hi>. This was<lb/>
in the San Bias lagoon, not far from where Ojeda was at San Sebastian--and<lb/>
the buccaneers were in no wise scarce of food--merely picnicking on the beach.</p>
<pb n="167" id="Cb000183"/>

<p><hi rend="italic">tados</hi>) by the poisoned arrows, until from hunger and from harmful foods,<lb/>
and from sickness,&rdquo; they were in great extremities (Las Casas, v. 3, 
p. 300).</p>
<p>After about four months of this (date not given), a small vessel, stolen<lb/>
by Bernardino Talavera, loaded with cassava bread and bacon, came in<lb/>
from Santo Domingo and temporarily relieved their distress. When this<lb/>
food was exhausted, Ojeda gave up and left for Santo Domingo, leaving<lb/>
Pizarro in command, and promising to bring or send relief within fifty<lb/>
days.<hi rend="superscript">12</hi></p>
<p>After waiting, starving, and skirmishing until past fifty days, &ldquo;during<lb/>
which time had died one half of the men left by Ojeda,&rdquo; Pizarro got ready<lb/>
to leave for Santo Domingo. The men remaining--given as 70 by<lb/>
Herrera and as 60 by Las Casas--were too many for the two brigantines<lb/>
they had left, so &ldquo;knowing that in a short time they would be sufficiently<lb/>
reduced by hunger, sickness, and the arrows of the Indians, they waited&rdquo;<lb/>
and in a few days, we are told, there was room aboard for all of them.<hi rend="superscript">13</hi></p>
<p>As they were leaving the harbor, one of the brigantines foundered, and<lb/>
all aboard her were lost. The other, with Pizarro, had just cleared the<lb/>
harbor when Encisco was seen coming in, according to agreement, with<lb/>
provisions, equipment, and reinforcements of 150 men. With him came<lb/>
Balboa.<hi rend="superscript">14</hi> This was &ldquo;six months after they had entered this Gulf,&rdquo;<lb/>
says Las Casas.</p>
<p>Let us examine Ojeda's losses. He left Santo Domingo with 300 men,<lb/>
100 of them recruited there. When he landed to build San Sebastian he</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">12</hi> Herrera says that Ojeda never reached his destination, but died, in the garb<lb/>
of a Franciscan, presumably in Cuba. Las Casas and Oviedo make the same state-<lb/>
ment as to the assumption of the ecclesiastical robe, but say that he reached Santo<lb/>
Domingo. &ldquo;He was in this city many days after this,&rdquo; says the former, &ldquo;and I<lb/>
believe for even a year. I saw him there (<hi rend="italic">Yo lo vid&eacute;</hi>).&rdquo; Both these ecclesiastical<lb/>
historians, Las Casas and Herrera, greatly praise and congratulate him on his<lb/> 
pious end.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">13</hi> This statement is possibly due to a desire to paint a very dark picture.<lb/>
There are several instances given of brigantines at this time carrying, as trans-<lb/>
ports, from thirty to thirty-four men as their ordinary complement, and the<lb/>
writer recalls none mentioned as carrying less than twenty-eight; and unless these<lb/>
two were unusually small, one would think that they would have crowded a few<lb/>
more on each one above the normal complement, and not waited for the excess to<lb/>
die off or be killed. It was only a short voyage from Santo Domingo, and the<lb/>
excess, accepting the figures of Herrera or Las Casas, must have been small.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">14</hi> He came surreptitiously. Oviedo says hidden in the bight of a sail; Las<lb/>
Casas, in a barrel; and, although we have all seen the picture of his bursting out<lb/>
of the barrel, the first is at once more dignified and more probable.</p>

<p>had lost 100 men in the attack on Matarap, and probably a few at Las<lb/>
Ollas. There were three disastrous raids attempted from the fort at<lb/>
San Sebastian. The number lost is not given, but the loss in the raid<lb/>
against Tirufi and in the first one made for food must have been heavy;<lb/>
and the sortie in which Ojeda was wounded was made by men weakened<lb/>
by hunger. The statement that the Spaniards feared to go outside of the<lb/>
fort for food on account of the arrows implies, too, that some did go out<lb/>
and were at least shot at. One would think, then, though no such<lb/>
numbers are given, that the loss from fighting during the three raids<lb/>
would not be less than in the one fight at Matarap, that is, about 100<lb/>
men. As 70 (or 60) is given as the number ready to sail with Pizarro,<lb/>
this would leave only 30 or 40 deaths from other causes to be accounted<lb/>
for--probably a few less. Considering the privations endured, this does<lb/>
not seem to be so many as to require the agency of yellow fever or any<lb/>
other malignant disease to account for them.</p>
<p>NICUESA's EXPEDITION</p>
<p>After staying about thirty-six hours where he landed to help Ojeda,<lb/>
Nicuesa set out to the west for Veragua, where he intended to settle.<lb/>
It is stated that he had lost no men in the attack on Matarap, yet the<lb/>
detailed distribution of his men given by Oviedo accounts for 50 less than<lb/>
the number (700) which Las Casas and Herrera give as leaving Santo<lb/>
Domingo. According to Oviedo, Nicuesa, with 70 men in a caravel, and<lb/>
Lope de Olano, his Captain General, with 30 men in one of his brigan-<lb/>
tines, went first, leaving 550 men and the rest of the fleet with Cueto at<lb/>
Puerto de Misas, to wait there until Nicuesa sent the brigantine back to<lb/>
show them the way to the settlement he purposed to make. One feels<lb/>
compelled to accept the 650 thus accounted for in detail as a more<lb/>
probably accurate figure than the round number, &ldquo;700 men,&rdquo; given by<lb/>
Las Casas and Herrera.</p>
<p>It is not purposed to go into the Iliad of woes of this most unfortunate<lb/>
expedition. After waiting two months, the time set by Nicuesa for his<lb/>
return, Cueto, with all of his part of the expedition, went to look for him.<lb/>
He went as far as the mouth of the Chagres (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Rio de Lagartos</hi>&rdquo;), where<lb/>
he stopped the fleet and sent a brigantine, with one of Columbus' old<lb/>
pilots, Pedro de Umbria, &ldquo;skilled on this coast,&rdquo; to look for Nicuesa.<lb/>
In the meantime, the provisions aboard the ships having spoiled, they<lb/>
were discharged and their boxes used to make huts for the people ashore.<lb/>
Here, then, the first fleet anchored and the bulk of the men remained for<lb/>
the present, and here, too, fourteen men were drowned in the swamping<lb/>
of a boat.</p>
<pb n="169" id="Cb000185"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
169</p>
<p>De Umbria, still proceeding westward, found Olano at anchor off the<lb/>
mouth of the river of Belem, in the present Republic of Panama. The<lb/>
two brigantines, Olano's and de Umbria's, went back together to the<lb/>
mouth of the Chagres. There Olano told Cueto that Nicuesa's caravel<lb/>
had been lost with all on board, his own vessel barely escaping wreck.<lb/>
He would give no details, &ldquo;falling weeping and crying out, &lsquo;It kills me to<lb/>
speak of it,&rsquo;&rdquo; when questioned. As, in event of Nicuesa's death, the<lb/>
command devolved on Olano, Cueto and his armada accompanied him<lb/>
back to Belem, which he asserted to be Veragua, the place at which<lb/>
Nicuesa intended to settle, although Veragua was, in truth, still some<lb/>
forty or forty-five miles beyond Belem to the west. Here, at Belem, a<lb/>
settlement was made, with Olano for governor, to whom the company--<lb/>
at least some three hundred of them-swore allegiance; and here, and<lb/>
at Santa Maria de Redondo close by, &ldquo;they remained for eight months&rdquo;<lb/>
under Olano's government, &ldquo;suffering grievous hungers and necessities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olano's statement concerning Nicuesa was intentionally untrue.<lb/>
There had been a dispute between the pilot aboard his ship (who had<lb/>
been on this coast with Columbus) and Nicuesa as to the position of<lb/>
Veragua. The pilot placed it at Belem, while Nicuesa, relying on a<lb/>
chart made by Columbus, placed it further west. Olano, siding with the<lb/>
pilot, had ceased, in the night, to follow the lantern on the poop of<lb/>
Nicuesa's caravel, which went before to set the course, turned into<lb/>
the harbor at Belem, and allowed Nicuesa to go on alone. Nicuesa<lb/>
waited for Olano a while, then sought him further west, Olano being, of<lb/>
course, to the eastward. Presently, in a river to the west of Belem,<lb/>
Nicuesa lost his own vessel and all material aboard her, including the<lb/>
clothing of his men, who swam ashore &ldquo;naked,&rdquo; state the historians.<lb/>
They made for themselves jackets of canvas from an old sail that washed<lb/>
ashore, one for Nicuesa as well as the others. He took up his march on<lb/>
foot along the shore, still westward, being helped over the rivers and<lb/>
estuaries by a ship's boat (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">barca</hi>&rdquo;), saved from the wreck, which, with<lb/>
a crew of four seamen, paralleled his course by sea.</p>
<p>They suffered much, &ldquo;walking without shoes and nearly naked<lb/>
through salt ponds and marshy places; over ravines and hills and through<lb/>
thickets, living on the shellfish found on the shore and wild things,&rdquo;<lb/>
mainly the buds of certain palms (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">palmitos</hi>&rdquo;). Finally, crossing an<lb/>
estuary some six miles wide, they reached a small island--not knowing<lb/>
that it was an island. Here their troubles culminated, for the sailors,<lb/>
believing that Olano was behind them, which indeed was the case, went<lb/>
off with the boat to look for him. &ldquo;They left at night, not asking<lb/>
<pb n="170" id="Cb000186"/>

YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
Nicuesa, because they believed he would forbid it.&rdquo; They went east<lb/>
ward, reversing their course, and by this act of insubordination undoubt<lb/>
edly saved the lives of the party.</p>
<p>Nicuesa and his men were marooned on this island more than three<lb/>
months, attempts to leave it, by rafts and by a canoe they dug out, being<lb/>
unsuccessful. On this island, which was called &ldquo;Escudo,&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">15</hi> were some<lb/>
trees bearing edible nuts. There was no water on the island save one<lb/>
muddy pond, so brackish that they could scarcely drink it, and--the nuts<lb/>
having been soon exhausted--no food save the shellfish they could pick<lb/>
up on the beach, and wild roots and herbs.</p>
<p>Oviedo states many died of hunger and hardship and that, when<lb/>
rescued, &ldquo;they were very weak from hunger and in a bad condition and<lb/>
full of worms in their throats and other parts of their bodies from eating<lb/>
certain roots.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">16</hi></p>
<p>The statements of our other historians must be taken with some<lb/>
reserve: that each day saw men die; that they walked about aimlessly,<lb/>
crying out like insane people; that they crawled on all fours,browsing on<lb/>
the herbage, because they were not able to stand upright. Yet their<lb/>
condition must have been deplorable, and, without admitting the<lb/>
hysteria, one has no doubt that a considerable proportion of even very<lb/>
hardy men would die under such conditions, continued for three months<lb/>
or more.</p>
<p>The journey of the small boat to Belem is reported as having been<lb/>
difficult, dangerous, and slow. On its arrival--Cueto was then with<lb/>
Olano--a brigantine with drinking water and such food as they had<lb/>
(&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">palmitos</hi>&rdquo;) was sent for Nicuesa. When he arrived at Belem he put<lb/>
Olano under arrest, in irons, threatening to hang him, and took charge<lb/>
of the expedition.</p>
<p>This was &ldquo;eight months after the treason of Olano,&rdquo; says Oviedo.<lb/>
Nearly all of this time Nicuesa had spent in his wandering along the<lb/>
shore and on Escudo Island. Nor had things gone well with Olano<lb/>
during this time. He had lost all of his vessels, wrecked on the bars at<lb/>
the mouths of rivers; and the settlement had suffered so much from</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">15</hi> The island known now as &ldquo;Escudo de Veraguas,&rdquo; is about sixty to sixty-five<lb/>
miles along the coast to the west of Belem, but we do not know whether this is<lb/>
the one on which Nicuesa was marooned, &ldquo;Escudo&rdquo; (shield) being a rather com-<lb/>
mon name given to small islands at this time.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">16</hi> Possibly the so-called &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">gusanos de vacas</hi>&rdquo; (beef worms, <hi rend="italic">dermatobia noxialis</hi>),<lb/>
not unfrequently found in the skin of exposed parts of the body in those sleeping<lb/>
out of doors in this country.</p>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
171</p>
<p>famine and privations that he had determined to abandon the venture<lb/>
and return to Santo Domingo, and was then engaged in building a<lb/>
caravel, using the planks of the wrecked vessels for that purpose.</p>
<p>His party had been put on short rations from the beginning. Cueto's<lb/>
armada brought very little food and many to eat it; and attempts to get<lb/>
provisions, from the Indians and otherwise, were in general unsuccess-<lb/>
ful. There was, indeed, not only scarcity but famine, as is evidenced by<lb/>
their having no food to send their chief save &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">palmitos</hi>.&rdquo; Many died.<lb/>
When the men who were at Belem united in begging Nicuesa to spare the<lb/>
life of Olano, they pleaded that he &ldquo;take no more Christian lives,&rdquo; as 400<lb/>
of their company had died already. This, one judges, included the<lb/>
deaths from the whole party--those at Belem and those who had been<lb/>
with Nicuesa. A strange plea, however, as the losses of both parties<lb/>
were primarily due to the intentional treachery of Olano.</p>
<p>Nicuesa, when he took command, was dissatisfied with the condition<lb/>
of the colony; there was neither gold nor food, and &ldquo;the place seemed to be<lb/>
unlucky.&rdquo; He became sick, and as his ill health continued, though he<lb/>
does not seem to have been sick enough to relinquish command, &ldquo;he<lb/>
became impatient and hard with others and the more so from day to<lb/>
day.&rdquo; He determined to abandon this site and seek a better one to the<lb/>
eastward, on the route he had come. He accordingly pressed the con-<lb/>
struction of the caravel, begun by Olano, and organized systematic raids<lb/>
on the Indians to get food, both for present needs and for use on the<lb/>
voyage. This led to reprisals by the Indians, who not only attacked his<lb/>
raiding parties, but threatened the settlement &ldquo;and were not far from<lb/>
finishing the Christians, because our men were too weak from hunger to<lb/>
support their arms.&rdquo; There was the usual &ldquo;eating of harmful things,&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">17</hi><lb/>
sickness, and mortality.</p>
<p>The expedition remained at Belem while a vessel was sent back to the<lb/>
east to look up a suitable place for settlement, and on its return Nicuesa<lb/>
and as many as there was room for in their transport, followed it. More<lb/>
were left at Belem, says Oviedo, than he took with him. A landing for<lb/>
food was attempted at Porto Bello, in which twenty men were lost, &ldquo;the<lb/>
Christians being too weak to hold up their arms.&rdquo; At Nombre de Dios,<lb/>
then called &ldquo;Chuchureyes&rdquo; by the Indians, and &ldquo;Puerto de Bastimen-<lb/>
tos&rdquo; by the Spaniards, a few miles further on, he landed. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">17</hi> As illustrating the extremities to which they were reduced, it is related--<lb/>
though hardly credible--that a raiding party of 30, finding the body of an Indian,<lb/>
&ldquo;killed by themselves or by others,&rdquo; ate it, although it was slightly decomposed,<lb/>
and that all thirty of them died.</p>
<pb n="172" id="Cb000188"/>

<p>he said, &ldquo;let us stop, in the name of God (<hi rend="italic">Paremos aqui en el nombre de<lb/>
Dios</hi>)&rdquo; and so it was done and Nombre de Dios founded.<hi rend="superscript">18</hi></p>
<p>His troubles were not over, however, as he had no provisions and no<lb/>
means of getting any save from the Indians. His main source of supply<lb/>
was Porto Bello and its vicinity, &ldquo;whence food was brought on the backs<lb/>
of men.&rdquo; This is about eight miles distant and, as the writer can testify,<lb/>
even now an extremely rough trail. &ldquo;They returned to the hungers<lb/>
and adversities of former times,&rdquo; says Oviedo.</p>
<p>Nicuesa began, too, building a wall to defend his new-founded city,<lb/>
&ldquo;and from this work,&rdquo; state our chroniclers, &ldquo;he spared none, high or<lb/>
low, sick or weak.&rdquo; He was unable to send for the men left at Belem<lb/>
until some five months later on account of the on-shore winds. There<lb/>
were sickness and death among his men. Herrera and Las Casas state<lb/>
that when the wall was finally finished, 200 more had died, of those<lb/>
left at Belem and of those accompanying Nicuesa to Nombre. This is<lb/>
in addition to the more than 400 deaths that had occurred before Nicuesa<lb/>
left Belem, and it is added that of those brought from Santo Domingo,<lb/>
only 100 were left. Round numbers, however, are rarely reliable.</p>
<p>A vessel from Darien, with provisions, brought by his lieutenant,<lb/>
Colmenares, came in about this time. On this Nicuesa returned to<lb/>
Darien, but he was not allowed to land there, mainly through Balboa's<lb/>
influence, from all accounts. He was placed on a ship with seventeen<lb/>
men &ldquo;very ill provided,&rdquo; as Oviedo reports, and was heard of no more.</p>
<p>Las Casas puts these happenings as at the end of the year 1510; but if<lb/>
we sum up the intervals of time given by our authors, with even a very<lb/>
conservative estimate for the time not given directly, we can scarcely<lb/>
make the total less than fifteen months since Nicuesa's departure from<lb/>
Puerto de Misas. As that was about the end of November, 1509, his<lb/>
arrival at Darien would be about the end of February, 1511. Indeed,<lb/>
Las Casas elsewhere gives the date of Nicuesa's sailing from Darien--<lb/>
two or three days after his arrival there--as March 1,1511; and this, one<lb/>
judges, is correct.</p>
<p>Deaths by violence, as reported, account for only a small proportion<lb/>
of Nicuesa's losses: 14 men from Cueto's armada are reported drowned</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">18</hi> Possibly Nicuesa, with his half-starved companions, was influenced in his<lb/>
selection of Nombre de Dios by the name and reputation of this &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Puerto de Basti-<lb/>
mentos</hi>&rdquo; (port of provisions), so called by Columbus. Otherwise, the reasons<lb/>
for his decision to &ldquo;rest here&rdquo; are not obvious, as Nombre de Dios is scarcely a<lb/>
harbor at all and he had passed by Porto Bello, eighteen miles to the west, and<lb/>
Playa de Damas, both offering more protected harborage.</p>
<pb n="173" id="Cb000189"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
173</p>
<p>at the Chagres; 30 died from eating a dead Indian; one was killed by <lb/>
Indians while walking the shore after the wreck of the caravel; and 20<lb/>
were killed at Porto Bello--in all 65 recorded. Some others, doubtless,<lb/>
were killed in the raids on the Indians at Belem, but no record of these is<lb/>
given. At any rate, there was no such loss by violence as that in Ojeda's<lb/>
expedition from the poisoned arrows of the Caribs. How many were<lb/>
alive when Nicuesa went up to Darien, when our count ceases, one does<lb/>
not know. Herrera says 70; Las Casas, first gives 70 and then 60;<lb/>
and Colmenares, who carried the provisions to Nicuesa and was his<lb/>
lieutenant, says &ldquo;not more than 200&rdquo; (Navarrete, vol. 3, p. 386). As<lb/>
the number that left Puerto de Misas was 650, of whom only 65 are re-<lb/>
ported as having died by violence or accident, we have to account for<lb/>
approximately 395 to 535 deaths from other causes than reported vio-<lb/>
lence. Either figure is a very large proportion, but the conditions, as<lb/>
we have seen, were extremely bad, and they lasted almost continuously<lb/>
for fifteen months. There seems no reason, then, to bring in yellow<lb/>
fever or any malignant sickness of that kind to account for the mortality.</p>
<p>Indeed, even if yellow fever existed at this time on the Caribbean<lb/>
littoral, it is highly improbable that it would have prevailed at Belem,<lb/>
where most of Nicuesa's losses occurred, unless the infection were<lb/>
brought there by Olano's men. The country here was very sparsely<lb/>
populated. Colmenares, (see Navarrete) speaks of Veragua and the<lb/>
coast adjacent to it as being a poor country, not good even for slaves, as<lb/>
the Indians &ldquo;were only a few fishermen.&rdquo; Olano's difficulty in getting<lb/>
food there witnesses to the same thing; as also the fact that it &ldquo;had to<lb/>
be carried incredible distances on the shoulders of our men;&rdquo; and no<lb/>
slaves were reported taken, although slave raids were begun at Nombre<lb/>
de Dios by Nicuesa after he settled there. Had slaves been readily<lb/>
obtainable at Belem, they had doubtless been taken, used as porters,<lb/>
and sold afterwards. So sparsely settled a country could not have<lb/>
remained infected with yellow fever any length of time, and hence was<lb/>
little apt to have been found infected at any particular time. If, how-<lb/>
ever, yellow fever had prevailed at Belem when Olano arrived there, it<lb/>
would have exhausted the human material available within the more<lb/>
than eight months of the time the Spaniards remained. Certainly, this<lb/>
would have happened if yellow fever were the cause of a considerable<lb/>
proportion of the more than 400 deaths reported as having occurred up<lb/>
to Nicuesa's arrival; and as those who reached Nombre would have been<lb/>
immune thereto, the deaths there would be attributable to other causes.</p>

<head>THE ISTHMUS OP PANAMA: THE COLONY AT DARIEN</head>
<pb n="174" id="Cb000190"/>
<p>BALBOA</p>
<p>With the coming of Enciso to Urava, the great losses which the<lb/>
Spaniards had suffered apparently ceased. Immediately after Enciso's<lb/>
arrival at the Gulf of Urava all the men, those who were with Pizarro<lb/>
in his brigantine, who had abandoned the enterprise, and the 150 who<lb/>
came with Enciso, instead of returning to Ojeda's old settlement,<lb/>
moved to the west side of the Gulf of Urava at the mouth of the River of<lb/>
Darien. The Indians here were not Caribs and did not use poisoned<lb/>
arrows. As, in addition, it was &ldquo;a place where there was gold and much<lb/>
provision,&rdquo; Balboa, who was accredited with having advised this mov-<lb/>
ing, gained sufficient credit to take command of this settlement,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> well-<lb/>
nigh as great an advantage to it as the escape from the poisoned arrows.<lb/>
Balboa not only made peace with the Indians, but made friends with<lb/>
some of them--especially with Cemaco, the <hi rend="italic">cacique</hi> in whose territory<lb/>
Darien was situated, and traded for provisions. He began, too, to raise<lb/>
food at Darien, doubtless with the Indian &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">naborios</hi>,&rdquo; of whom there<lb/>
were more than twelve hundred when Pedrarias arrived. These friendly<lb/>
relations with the Indians lasted, except on the San Juan (Atrato)<lb/>
River, during the whole of his government, to June 30, 1514. He is<lb/>
credited by Las Casas with having 450 men; but when he took command<lb/>
he had much fewer than this,<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> and in his expeditions used small numbers<lb/>
which could live off the country without oppressing it. In a letter to</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> As this new settlement was in Nicuesa's concession, not Ojeda's, the latter's<lb/>
assignment of his authority to Pizarro and Enciso was invalid. If the appoint-<lb/>
ment of Vasco Nu&ntilde;ez was, as our chroniclers (Las Casas and Oviedo) say, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">por<lb/>
votos</hi>,&rdquo; it was the first popular election in the New World--the foundation of<lb/>
democracy.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> With Pizarro were found less than 70 men; 150 came with Enciso; and some-<lb/>
what later, with Colmenares, 14 or 24, according to which author we follow; and<lb/>
17 went back and were lost with Nicuesa. Whether the men left by Nicuesa at<lb/>
Nombre, (variously given as 60, 70, or 200) remained there or came up to Darien,<lb/>
is not stated. Possibly the latter, but Darien and Nombre are over two hundred<lb/>
miles apart, and the current belief is that the present Nombre de Dios dates from<lb/>
Nicuesa's time and has never been abandoned.</p>
<p>174</p>
<pb n="175" id="Cb000191"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
175</p>
<p>the King, quoted by Las Casas (vol. iv, p. 131), he says that &ldquo;of the 190<lb/>
men brought out from Darien there could be utilized scarcely 80 because<lb/>
the rest, on account of the hungers and hardships which they suffered,<lb/>
or from being sick or very weak, were not able to aid in anything.&rdquo;<lb/>
After the colony began to get on its feet, men began to come in, as with<lb/>
Serrano, &ldquo;150 of whom were men of war&rdquo;--from Santo Domingo, one<lb/>
thinks. There were 600 men at Darien in March, 1511, and Balboa<lb/>
took 800 with him when he set out, September 1, 1513, to discover the<lb/>
Pacific. Yet only 70 men went with him on the overland march<lb/>
to the &ldquo;peak in Darien,&rdquo; from which he saw the South Sea; and only<lb/>
twenty-six &ldquo;of the best conditioned and most enduring&rdquo; marched to<lb/>
this sea itself, when he took possession of it on St. Michael's Day for<lb/>
the King of Spain.</p>
<p>His expeditions, then, making friends with the Indians, getting pro-<lb/>
visions, and finally going across to the South Sea, were made with small<lb/>
bodies of men. He states, in this same letter, that he had lost no men.<lb/>
Oviedo, however, gives an account of 28 being lost in an attempt to<lb/>
explore the Atrato, and these were probably Balboa's men.</p>
<p>The factors operating to produce this difference in losses between<lb/>
Balboa's and Ojeda's commands were, one thinks:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>1. That Balboa moved out of the Carib territory to that of a more<lb/>
peaceful race of Indians, not using poisoned arrows.</item>
<item>2. His making friends with these Indians and arranging to obtain a<lb/>
sufficient supply of food from them.</item>
<item>3. His &ldquo;instituting agriculture&rdquo; at Darien.</item>
<item>4. His using, during his expeditions, only a small number of men, who<lb/>
were thus able to live off the country without exciting warlike opposition.</item>
<item>5. The fact that the men he had were used to conditions in the<lb/>
American tropics. The writer would lay as much stress on this last as do<lb/>
B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud and Finlay, but not as necessarily implying specific<lb/>
immunity to any prevalent infectious disease.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>It seems no more necessary, then, to ascribe the small mortality in<lb/>
Balboa's expeditions, as compared with Ojeda's, to the immunity of his<lb/>
men to any specific disease acquired by prior attack than it does to make<lb/>
the same explanation for the comparative safety of the older settlers at<lb/>
Jamestown or of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">gens des mains</hi>&rdquo; of the French Antilles.</p>
<p>The settlement at Darien grew and prospered under Balboa's govern-<lb/>
ment until 1514. It unquestionably received immigrants, mainly, one<lb/>
presumes, from Santo Domingo. During this time nothing is reported<lb/>
of any special sickness among them. The Indians were peaceful and<lb/>
<pb n="176" id="Cb000192"/>

YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
food was abundant. When Nicuesa came there from Nombre de Dios,<lb/>
about March 1, 1511, Darien was well settled; there was food, gold was<lb/>
not lacking, and there were &ldquo;more than 600 men&rdquo; (Oviedo).</p>
<p>PEDRARIAS AND THE &ldquo;MODORRA&rdquo; AT DARIEN</p>
<p>On the 30th of June, 1514, Pedro Arias de Avila (Pedrarias Davila)<lb/>
landed at Darien direct from Spain, to supersede Balboa, bringing with<lb/>
him some 2,000 men, the great bulk of them &ldquo;young hidalgos and cour-<lb/>
tiers.&rdquo; The policy was now changed. The Indians were raided on all<lb/>
sides for gold and slaves. Friendly <hi rend="italic">caciques</hi> suffered more than the un-<lb/>
friendly ones, because they were more accessible and took less pre-<lb/>
cautions to escape the Spaniards. Oviedo, himself a soldier, speaks with<lb/>
strong reprobation of the &ldquo;depopulation of the land&rdquo; by &ldquo;this infernal<lb/>
hunt for men.&rdquo; Provisions were no longer obtainable from the Indians,<lb/>
and the cornfields were at this time destroyed by grasshoppers. The<lb/>
food raised at Darien was, naturally, entirely insufficient for the much<lb/>
larger number of men. Pedrarias had brought a large supply of pro-<lb/>
visions from Spain, which were placed in a storehouse built for them.<lb/>
These provisions were wasted, however, and soon there was a scarcity of<lb/>
food. Later, the storehouse took fire and burned up with its contents,<lb/>
Oviedo stating that it was believed that this was done to conceal the<lb/>
shortage of supplies caused by the peculations of the storekeepers.</p>
<p>The colony was entirely too large to live off the country, especially as<lb/>
the production of food had been diminished by the grasshoppers and by<lb/>
the measures of Pedrarias, nor did the colonists know how to adapt<lb/>
themselves to local food and conditions.</p>
<p>With the famine, as always, was sickness, and while all of our authors<lb/>
ascribe it to the famine, it was, we think, too general for this to have been<lb/>
the sole cause<hi rend="italic">3</hi> The sickness--and especially its severity--was, how-<lb/>
ever, unquestionably increased by the famine. Here are the accounts<lb/>
of this episode given by our historians:</p>
<p>First, Oviedo: &ldquo;And in this infernal chase or hunting were the people<lb/>
engaged some months, in which time . . . . prevailed in Darien so great a<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi> and sicknesses among the Christians and in especial for those<lb/>
who had newly landed from that armada that each day died fifteen or<lb/>
twenty and some days more, and in a little time died more than 500 men,<lb/>
and the most of them for lack of provisions, although the King had them<lb/>
in abundance&rdquo; (in the storehouse in Darien). Then is told how that</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> This is also Oviedo's opinion: &ldquo;an accidental <hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>,&rdquo; he calls it.</p>
<pb n="177" id="Cb000193"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
177</p>
<p>&ldquo;although men fell dead in the streets from hunger&rdquo; yet provisions were<lb/>
kept in the storehouse, until the storehouse was burned and all destroyed.<lb/>
Oviedo states that officials did not lack for food. He does not say<lb/>
whether they escaped the sicknesses or not.</p>
<p>He continues: &ldquo;Since as the deaths and sicknesses were many and the<lb/>
hunger intolerable, many who were in that armada fled from the land.<lb/>
Some returned to Spain and others passed to this our island of Hispan-<lb/>
iola, to Cuba and to Jamaica, and to San Juan; and in the space of seven<lb/>
or eight months<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> those who had fled and those who had died were more<lb/>
than those who remained in this land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herrera gives: &ldquo;Whilst he&rdquo; (Pedrarias) &ldquo;was arranging and preparing<lb/>
to send the people to the three settlements,&rdquo; which he was planning,<lb/>
&ldquo;they began to waste the provisions of the fleet, which had already been<lb/>
spoiled by the sea, and rations began to be scant; on which account and<lb/>
because the place was sickly where they were settled, which were marshes<lb/>
and low and shady places, and because of the differences of the airs . . . .<lb/>
the new men, who had come with Pedrarias, began to sicken and to die.<lb/>
And he (Pedrarias) did not escape, and his sickness having become very<lb/>
severe he went out of Darien&rdquo; by his physician's advice, to a healthier<lb/>
place. &ldquo;And when all the rations of the King were finished, the calamity<lb/>
of hunger increased to such a degree that many cavaliers died begging<lb/>
bread, who had left their estates mortgaged in Castile, and others who<lb/>
gave a cloak of crimson silk and other rich vestments for one pound<lb/>
of bread of maize or of cassava or hard bread of Castile. A cavalier,<lb/>
one of the principal ones who had come with Pedrarias, went out into<lb/>
the street crying out that he was perishing for bread, and in front of all<lb/>
the people, falling on the ground, his soul departed. Never does it ap-<lb/>
pear that a like thing was seen; that people so attired in silk and in bro-<lb/>
cade, and who were wealthy, should fall at each step dead of hunger.<lb/>
Others were going out in the fields grazing and eating the herbs and roots<lb/>
which they found most tender, as if they were beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herrera says that they were buried several in one grave, &ldquo;and to con-<lb/>
clude, in one month died 700 men of hunger and of <hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>.&ldquo; He blames<lb/>
Pedrarias severely for the confusion, disorder, and profiteering that pre-<lb/>
vailed.</p>
<p>Las Casas adds nothing to the above, his account agreeing almost<lb/>
verbatim with that of Herrera, except that he does not give the number<lb/>
of deaths.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> The implication here is that this condition lasted seven or eight months.</p>
<pb n="178" id="Cb000194"/>
<p>178<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>No description is given of this sickness, unless that it was called a<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>&rdquo; (drowsiness or stupor) may be considered in some sort as a<lb/>
description. This designation was habitually used by Spanish writers<lb/>
of this time for typhus and typhoid fevers, but obviously it does not<lb/>
refer here to typhus, for no lice-borne infection could have propagated<lb/>
itself in the climate of Darien.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> The use of the term, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>,&rdquo; may<lb/>
not have been confined, especially by laymen, to the fevers above men-<lb/>
tioned, yet the writer knows of no instance in which it was used as the<lb/>
designation of any epidemic of what was certainly yellow fever, as that<lb/>
of 1648 in Yucatan, or of 1649 in Havana. And it would not naturally<lb/>
be so used, for the characteristics of yellow fever are restlessness and<lb/>
delirium rather than a drowsiness and stupor, even the short final coma,<lb/>
when it occurs, usually ending in a convulsion.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>,&rdquo; however, in the conditions under which it occurred,<lb/>
is more like yellow fever than anything that we have found in the New<lb/>
World prior to 1648--a generalized sickness of high mortality among a<lb/>
body of newly arrived immigrants in a tropical climate. This is what<lb/>
would occur with yellow fever in an endemic center. The only thing in<lb/>
direct opposition to it is Oviedo's implication that the epidemic lasted<lb/>
seven or eight months. This, of course, had been impossible with yellow<lb/>
fever of the intensity reported among so small a body of men.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> This<lb/>
long duration is only an implication, however, not a direct statement.<lb/>
On the other hand, famine was severe; and though the mortality was<lb/>
high (one-fourth of the total number),<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> it was not higher than that<lb/>
occurring in other settlements of Europeans in America where there is no<lb/>
suspicion of yellow fever; as at Plymouth in the first winter, at James-<lb/>
town, and in Laudonni&egrave;re's colony, etc. Moreover, Pedrarias' men--<lb/>
hidalgos and men of the court--were peculiarly ill-fitted for frontier<lb/>
conditions. The writer, too, has seen practically 100 per cent of Span-<lb/>
iards (<hi rend="italic">Gallegos</hi>), new-come to this same Isthmus, sent to hospital with<lb/>
malaria within eight weeks of arrival.<hi rend="superscript">8</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> The relapsing fever of the tropics, the tick-borne <hi rend="italic">spirochetosis</hi>, could have<lb/>
done so had the causative organism been present and this would have merited the<lb/>
name &ldquo;modorra.&rdquo; There is no evidence that this occurred, however.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">6</hi> Malaria in that time would have shown an increase in mortality by its recur-<lb/>
rent attacks.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> The number of deaths (500) given by Oviedo is accepted as against the 700 of<lb/>
Herrera. Oviedo was on the ground and had every opportunity of knowing. If<lb/>
Herrera, in his reports from the <hi rend="italic">tierra firme</hi>, had a record of 700 deaths, it might<lb/>
well be a question what districts or what length of time it covered.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">8</hi> This was in 1906 in the Culebra District, at Lirio, as I recall, and, unlike Dar-<lb/>
ien, on high land. Following the lead of Pedrarias with Darien, we also &ldquo;depopu-</p>

179</p>
<p>While, then, it is not possible to say that this &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>&rdquo; was <hi rend="italic">not</hi><lb/>
yellow fever, the evidence is not sufficient to establish it as such or even<lb/>
to render this very probable.</p>
<p>PEDRARIAS THE YOUNGER</p>
<p>Finlay notes another sickness among the Spaniards who came with<lb/>
Pedrarias. He sent his nephew, of the same name as himself, with 200<lb/>
men to the Cen&uacute; River, about 100 miles from Darien. They embarked<lb/>
in small boats to row up the river. The Cen&uacute; was swift, and poling<lb/>
against the current was hard. The sun was very hot, the mosquitoes<lb/>
numerous, &ldquo;and they commenced to fall sick and to die.&rdquo; Young<lb/>
Pedrarias, not finding any place suitable for settlement, returned to<lb/>
Darien, &ldquo;having lost one-half of his party.&rdquo; This is from Las Casas (<hi rend="italic">op.<lb/>
cit., tom.</hi> iv, <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> 180).</p>
<p>There is no statement as to the length of time young Pedrarias was on<lb/>
this expedition. He apparently made no stop of any length of time<lb/>
ashore. It would be well-nigh impossible for an epidemic of yellow fever,<lb/>
carrying off 50 per cent of his force, to occur in so small a moving body of<lb/>
men. On the other hand, malaria quite probably had been introduced<lb/>
into this region by the Spanish communication with it from the time of<lb/>
Bastidas, Guerra, and de la Cosa, say from 1502; and even accepting this<lb/>
account as true, as Finlay does, it could scarcely be considered yellow<lb/>
fever.</p>
<p>Herrera mentions this same expedition, but gives young Pedrarias 400<lb/>
men. He says nothing about sickness, but that &ldquo;men were killed in<lb/>
encounters with the Indians&rdquo;--fifteen in one attempt to land. This was<lb/>
Carib country. Enciso also took an expedition to the same region and<lb/>
was roughly handled by the Caribs. Oviedo does not mention the<lb/>
expedition of young Pedrarias, although he gives a long account of the<lb/>
expeditions of the subordinates of Pedrarias, including that of Enciso.<lb/>
One wonders where Las Casas got his data, and except that Finlay<lb/>
quotes this, I had not mentioned it (Finlay, 1912, p. 119).</p>

<p>lated&rdquo; this village and moved our own men, as they emerged from hospital, to Las<lb/>
Cascadas. Our deaths, indeed, were nothing like the proportion as given at Dar-<lb/>
ien, but then we had an abundance of food for both sick and well, good hospitals,<lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">quinine</hi>. Had the same conditions prevailed as at Darien, one has an idea<lb/>
that the death rate would have been very high.</p>

<pb n="180" id="Cb000196"/>
<p>AUTHORITIES</p>
<p>For the reasons which have been given in Chapter VII and elsewhere,<lb/>
the writer accepts the epidemic of 1648 in Yucatan as unquestionably<lb/>
yellow fever, and as being the first epidemic in the New World that can<lb/>
be so identified with certainty. He thinks, then, that this year, 1648,<lb/>
may be taken as marking the division between what Chaill&eacute; (1882) has<lb/>
designated as &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;historical&rdquo; yellow fever. Certain it is<lb/>
that after 1648 reports of epidemics of what we believe--and in some<lb/>
instances are sure--was yellow fever become common, and are well<lb/>
enough authenticated to be considered, as Chaill&eacute; characterizes them,<lb/>
&ldquo;historical.&rdquo; However, Chaill&eacute; himself, accepting as undoubted yellow<lb/>
fever the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; which occurred in Guadeloupe in 1635, desig-<lb/>
nated that year as dividing the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; from the &ldquo;traditional.&rdquo;<lb/>
Let us then consider whether the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; is identified as yellow<lb/>
fever.</p>
<p>As to the nature of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; from which the early colonists<lb/>
of Guadeloupe suffered in 1635 and later, let us examine (1) the condi-<lb/>
tions under which it occurred and (2) such description of it, clinical and<lb/>
otherwise, as we have. Our authorities are P&egrave;re du Tertre and
P&egrave;re<lb/>
Breton and, negatively, P&egrave;re Bouton, all members of the Society of<lb/>
Jesus, and all missionaries to the French colonies of the West Indies and<lb/>
Guiana.</p>
<p>P&egrave;re du Tertre was evidently a highly cultivated man, intelligent,<lb/>
well informed, and used to the great world of Europe. His <hi rend="italic">Histoire<lb/>
Generale des Antilles habit&eacute;es par les Fran&ccedil;ois</hi> (1667-71), in four<lb/>
volumes, covers from the settlement of St. Christophe, in 1627, to 1667<lb/>
and beyond. It is full of interesting detail, not all of it important for<lb/>
our purpose. He did not come to the islands until 1640, and was thus<lb/>
not an eye-witness of conditions during the first five years of the settle-<lb/>
ment of Guadeloupe.</p>
<p>P&egrave;re Breton was also an intelligent and cultivated man. He came to<lb/>
Guadeloupe with the first colonists in 1635, and his account is contained<lb/>
in two dictionaries--one Carib-French, (1665), and one French-Carib<lb/>
(1666). No one save an industrious and most intelligent and observing<lb/>
180<lb/>
<pb n="181" id="Cb000197"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
181<lb/>
man would have written them--the Carib-French especially. This is<lb/>
really a brief history of the islands and of their inhabitants and products<lb/>
as they were when he arrived and soon afterwards. He was an eye-<lb/>
witness to the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; in the beginning and to the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">disette</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
(scarcity of food, or famine) which preceded it. Indeed, his clinical<lb/>
description of the former--a strange thing to find in a dictionary--is so<lb/>
like that of du Tertre, even in the turns of expression, that one feels<lb/>
quite sure that the latter was copied from it and thus, also, is the record<lb/>
of an eye-witness, but of Breton, not du Tertre.</p>
<p>SETTLEMENT OF GUADELOUPE</p>
<p>Guadeloupe was settled by de l'Olive and du Plessis under the auspices<lb/>
of a French Colonization Company. St. Christophe (St. Kitts) had been<lb/>
settled in 1627 by two adventurers, d'Enambuc and Warner, the one<lb/>
French, the other English, who had combined against the Spaniards. In<lb/>
spite of some disagreements and even small wars between the two races, it<lb/>
was, in 1635, an established and flourishing colony, and later became a<lb/>
resort of the filibusters of both nations.</p>
<p>Du Plessis and de 1'Olive left Dieppe on May 25, 1635, with two vessels,<lb/>
having aboard 550 colonists and four priests, among whom were P&egrave;res<lb/>
Breton and Pelleprat. They reached Martinique June 25, but decided<lb/>
not to settle there on account of its being too mountainous, according to<lb/>
our historian; on account of the multitude of serpents, says P&egrave;re Pelle-<lb/>
prat. They reached Guadeloupe on June 28, choosing, says du Tertre,<lb/>
a bad place for settlement, &ldquo;the land being red and better suited for<lb/>
making bricks than to grow plants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The troubles of the colonists had begun aboard ship. They were<lb/>
both ill and scantily provisioned, and much of what they had spoiled en<lb/>
route. So little cider had been provided that it was &ldquo;extended&rdquo; by<lb/>
adding 50 per cent seawater to it, &ldquo;which caused an unbelievable<lb/>
alteration in all the passengers . . . . so that some died as soon as they<lb/>
landed.&rdquo; &ldquo;All were half dead when they landed.&rdquo; They were said to<lb/>
be &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">pauvres engagez</hi>,&rdquo; utterly unsuited for pioneer life, and too many to<lb/>
live off the country. Nor had they leaders of sufficient force and exper-<lb/>
ience properly to guide them. They had brought neither &ldquo;potatoes,<lb/>
manioc, peas, nor beans for planting.&rdquo; They had to send to St.<lb/>
Christophe to get these things for seed. They depended solely on<lb/>
France for food, of which they had brought only two months' supply.<lb/>
It was necessary to put them on rations from the beginning: at first one<lb/>
pound of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">paste</hi>&rdquo; (one presumes the wet flour they brought with them),<lb/>
soon reduced to five ounces. There were turtles on the beach, but eat-<lb/>
<pb n="182" id="Cb000198"/>
182<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
ing them without bread caused sickness (diarrhea and dysentery) of<lb/>
which some died, and turtles were for a time forbidden.</p>
<p>FAMINE</p>
<p>A &ldquo;horrible&rdquo; famine then afflicted the colony two months after its<lb/>
establishment . . . . &ldquo;you would see hungry men grazing herbage like<lb/>
beasts and eating their own excrement.&rdquo; &ldquo;Seeing themselves prevented<lb/>
from procuring food to satisfy this hunger, they exposed themselves<lb/>
voluntarily to extreme severity of punishment, preferring rather to end<lb/>
their misery by the hands of the executioner than to drag out longer a<lb/>
life which famine had rendered more cruel than death.&rdquo; Some little<lb/>
food was taken from the Indians on the island. The Indians themselves,<lb/>
however, were living a hand-to-mouth existence, and the Indian war<lb/>
which followed added to the distress of the colonists, as they could no<lb/>
longer hunt or go into the woods for roots, fruits, etc., and had to stand<lb/>
regular watches against surprises. They ate the few famished dogs<lb/>
they had, and even the bodies of their dead. The good Father gives an<lb/>
instance (and says that it was not the only one) in which the trenches in<lb/>
which the dead were buried were opened, and the bodies eaten. One<lb/>
man who had been branded twice on the shoulder, when saved from the<lb/>
gallows by the intervention of P&egrave;re Breton, deliberately repeated his<lb/>
offence, of theft, &ldquo;preferring to be promptly hung rather than to live<lb/>
longer exposed to the insupportable rigors of this hunger&rdquo; (Du Tertre,<lb/>
vol. 1, p. 75 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>).</p>
<p>Of this famine, P&egrave;re Breton, who was with it from the beginning, gives<lb/>
this (<hi rend="italic">Dictionaire Caraibe-Fran&ccedil;ois, 1665</hi>, p. 226-7): &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">E&uacute;mijn--famine<lb/>
. . . disette</hi>.&rdquo; He states that when they were at war with the Caribs<lb/>
they dared not go into the woods or along the coast to look for food,<lb/>
for the Caribs killed as many as they could find, and &ldquo;the scarcity<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">disette</hi>) of bread and of water made them&rdquo; (the colonists) &ldquo;waste away<lb/>
in such sort that they were more yellow than quinces and more dry<lb/>
than Brazil wood, having only skin and bones: in taking tobacco, in<lb/>
speaking, and walking, they fell in agony without other malady than<lb/>
pure necessity and feebleness. We buried them four and four in one<lb/>
ditch, which we had enough trouble to have made, not finding anyone&rdquo;<lb/>
(strong enough) &ldquo;for that purpose, nor to carry the dead. When we<lb/>
exhorted the sick men to confess themselves, they gave no other answer<lb/>
than &lsquo;bread! bread!&rsquo;&rdquo; It was evidently a severe famine.</p>
<p>Again, du Tertre (<hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>, p. 81): &ldquo;This famine, which lasted nearly<lb/>
<pb n="183" id="Cb000199"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
183<lb/>
five years<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>. . . was followed by a mortality nearly general to which, be-<lb/>
sides the famine, two things contributed particularly.&rdquo; The first was &ldquo;a<lb/>
certain malady which is commonly called <hi rend="italic">le coup de Barre</hi> in these islands.<lb/>
It causes ordinarily to those who are taken (<hi rend="italic">surpris</hi>) with it, a very<lb/>
violent headache, accompanied by a beating of the arteries of the<lb/>
temples and by a great difficulty of breathing with a weakness and a pain<lb/>
in the thighs, as if one had been struck blows with a stick (<hi rend="italic">coups de<lb/>
Barre</hi>) which has given reason for the name imposed on it. It attacks<lb/>
ordinarily those who clear up the lands of these islands, on account of the<lb/>
venemous vapors which they exhale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cruelty of the Commandants, who presided over the work, was<lb/>
the other cause of death of the greater part of the colony. For although<lb/>
the poor <hi rend="italic">engagez</hi>, whether pledged to the gentlemen of the Company or<lb/>
to the merchants of Dieppe, were extraordinarily enfeebled by misery<lb/>
and hunger, they were treated worse than slaves, and they were forced<lb/>
to the work only by blows of sticks and of halberd shafts; insomuch<lb/>
that some of them, who had been captives in Barbary, cursed the day<lb/>
when they left that place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tertre especially notes that no ration (at one time five ounces of<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">paste</hi>&rdquo;) was issued to the colonists until they had worked to noon,<lb/>
which he, and apparently they, considered a hardship. This was both<lb/>
a sanitary and an economic error.</p>
<p>It seems proper here to give also the description of P&egrave;re Breton, who<lb/>
was an eye-witness to the things he relates; du Tertre was not an eye-<lb/>
witness to anything occurring prior to 1640. Breton's dictionary (1665,<lb/>
p. 276) gives the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Ib&oacute;manhatina iepoulic&aacute;atina</hi>, in the commencement of the colony<lb/>
in the isle of Guadeloupe, partly by famine, partly because as in meas-<lb/>
ure we cut down the wood, the land threw out all its venom, we were<lb/>
taken with a beating of the head within the temples, with a short breath</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> It is not possible that the famine lasted from 1635 to 1640 with the severity<lb/>
depicted above. In a less time than this all had died. The &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">disette</hi>&rdquo; must have<lb/>
been merely a &ldquo;scarcity&rdquo; after the early part of the five years. Nor do I think<lb/>
that the words &ldquo;was followed by&rdquo; means that the events to be related began as<lb/>
soon as the famine was past (according to this in 1640), but that the famine came<lb/>
first and the events the historian is about to relate began <hi rend="italic">after it began</hi>. P&egrave;re<lb/>
Bouton (1640, pp. 88-95), who visited Martinique in 1640, gives a section to the<lb/>
sicknesses of &ldquo;these Islands&rdquo; (using the plural) but makes no mention of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup<lb/>
de barre</hi>,&rdquo; although he does mention intermittent fevers, yaws, chigoes, etc., as<lb/>
existing in them. Nor does he note any lack of provisions. Martinique, at that<lb/>
time, had 1,000 Frenchmen and &ldquo;would have had 2,000 were it not for the fear of<lb/>
serpents&rdquo;--of which there are an abundance. The <hi rend="italic">fer-de-lance</hi> exists in Martini-<lb/>
que and, I think, in no other of the Little Antilles.</p>
<pb n="184" id="Cb000200"/>
<p>184<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>and with a great weakness of the thighs, so that we were as if someone<lb/>
had given us a blow with a stick (<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>), and indeed, a man in<lb/>
order to express this illness would say, &lsquo;I have the <hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>.&rsquo; It<lb/>
must have been that the savages well knew this sickness: for they name<lb/>
it as it is at the head of this article&rdquo; (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">iepoulic&aacute;atina</hi>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>THE COUP DE BARRE</p>
<p>This statement that the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; was an indigenous disease<lb/>
among the Indians and well known to them before the advent of Euro-<lb/>
peans--its occurrence among the French was 142 years after the settle-<lb/>
ment of Isabela--is quoted and insisted on by many writers. That the<lb/>
Caribs of Guadeloupe called this malady, of which P&egrave;re Breton is writing,<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">iepoulic&aacute;atina</hi>&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">iepoulic&aacute;atina</hi>&rdquo; is literally &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; in<lb/>
their tongue, is directly stated by the good Father and may be accepted.<lb/>
However, his deduction from these premises, that these Indians &ldquo;knew<lb/>
well this malady,&rdquo; in the sense of having previous knowledge of it, seems<lb/>
a <hi rend="italic">non sequitur</hi>. We have seen how quickly the Mexicans and Mayas<lb/>
adopted descriptive names for smallpox, of which they certainly had no<lb/>
knowledge before the Spaniards came, the Mexican name (<hi rend="italic">huey &ccedil;ahuatl</hi>:<lb/>
great pox) stressing its appearance; while the Maya name (<hi rend="italic">pom kakil</hi>:<lb/>
gum copal fire) described its sensation. That the Caribs should, of<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">themselves</hi>, have selected the literal equivalent of the name which the<lb/>
French, of their own initiative, gave to the so-called &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
when it appeared among them, seems most improbable; and when this<lb/>
name, in both instances, is not so much the description of a symptom as<lb/>
the designation of an action which might cause the symptom, the chance<lb/>
of both French and Caribs selecting this same name independently of<lb/>
each other becomes extremely small. On the other hand, if this sickness<lb/>
was hitherto unknown to the Caribs, they would naturally, almost in-<lb/>
evitably, adopt for its name the one the French gave it, translated into<lb/>
their own tongue. The fact that &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">iepoulic&aacute;atina</hi>&rdquo; is literally &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de<lb/>
barre</hi>&rdquo; is, if the latter name was given to this sickness by the French<lb/>
independently of the Caribs (as is implied by Breton's narrative), evi-<lb/>
dence that the Caribs got their name for it from the French and that they<lb/>
were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> previously familiar with this sickness, else they had retained<lb/>
their own name for it.</p>
<p>What this &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; was, the writer does not know. The de-<lb/>
scription of it is not especially like yellow fever, less so indeed than it is<lb/>
like that of a number of other acute diseases which might occur in the<lb/>
tropics; and indeed it is only the use of the word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">surpris</hi>,&rdquo; translated<lb/>
<pb n="185" id="Cb000201"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
185<lb/>
&ldquo;taken,&rdquo; that makes one limit the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; to an <hi rend="italic">acute</hi> disease, and<lb/>
this may be an error.</p>
<p>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DATA</p>
<p>No figures are given of the number of deaths. It is implied that they<lb/>
were many, especially in Breton's account. Yet, receiving few rein-<lb/>
forcements from France until 1640 or later, and these being only colonists,<lb/>
with practically no provisions--&ldquo;an onus, not a help,&rdquo; says du Tertre--<lb/>
they held their own in war against the Caribs of this island and those of<lb/>
St. Lucia, Dominica, St. Vincent's, and Barbuda as well, finally cleared<lb/>
land enough to raise their own food, and established the colony. In 1664,<lb/>
it was a flourishing colony--and with apparently as many scandals afloat<lb/>
as St. Germaine itself. Enough survived, then, for these purposes.<lb/>
Note, too, that of the four priests, none died at this time. In the<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; of 1648 several died at Martinique and St. Christophe.</p>
<p>Making what allowance one feels reasonable for exaggeration, we<lb/>
must admit that there was a severe famine and that the living conditions<lb/>
were extremely bad. We would expect a heavy mortality among 550<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">pauvres engagez</hi>&rdquo; left in the woods on a tropical island with two months'<lb/>
provisions. It had been a miracle had it not occurred. Had yellow<lb/>
fever of ordinary intensity attacked them, the case mortality had been<lb/>
100 per cent-and all were susceptible. The writer agrees with Fin-<lb/>
lay (1912, p. 141) that this &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; could not have been yellow<lb/>
fever, on account of the low mortality; and with Cornilliac (1886,<lb/>
p. 304), that it was a disease differing in its characteristics from that<lb/>
occurring in 1648, because: (1) the descriptions differ; and (2) the<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>,&rdquo; introduced into Guadeloupe in 1648, was designated by du Tertre<lb/>
as a disease &ldquo;hitherto unknown since the occupation of these islands by<lb/>
the French.&rdquo; The &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; of 1648, we feel reasonably sure, was yellow<lb/>
fever, from its description, the epidemiology given, and its high mortality.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION BY DU TERTRE</p>
<p>Concerning the nature of this &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>,&rdquo; the quotation given<lb/>
from du Tertre is the one and (save by Cornilliac), I think, the only one<lb/>
given by writers discussing this subject. There is, however, another<lb/>
note by du Tertre on this malady, or it may be on a different one called <lb/>
by the same name, which the writer has never seen quoted anywhere.<lb/>
In his <hi rend="italic">Histoire Generale des Antilles</hi> (vol. 2, p. 477 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>) we find:<lb/>
&ldquo;Of the Sicknesses to Which the Inhabitants of our Islands are Subject.&rdquo;<lb/>
This was written when the colony was well established and flourishing, <lb/>
long after the account first quoted. After noting the occurrence here,<lb/>
<pb n="186" id="Cb000202"/>
186<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
as in France, of intermittent and continued fevers, pleurisies, colics,<lb/>
and dysenteries, he says the islanders &ldquo;are also subject to certain ill-<lb/>
nesses which they call stomach disorders (<hi rend="italic">maux d'estomac</hi>) and hydrop-<lb/>
sies which disconcert all the surgeons and cause two thirds of all the<lb/>
deaths on the islands, but particularly of the poor <hi rend="italic">engagez</hi>.&rdquo; Ascribing<lb/>
their sickness to indiscreet habits, he says of those newly arrived from<lb/>
France that &ldquo;they drink water as cold as ice, and, wet with the sweat<lb/>
of the day's toil, they lie uncovered in the coolness of the night. . . .<lb/>
Then they are taken (<hi rend="italic">surpris</hi>) with a debility, with lassitude and with<lb/>
troubles (<hi rend="italic">maux</hi>) of the heart, which are followed by slow fevers and<lb/>
above all by the sickness which they call &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>,&rdquo; which is no<lb/>
other than a pain that takes them in the middle of the thighs, which<lb/>
prevents them from moving, and all this is accompanied by a raging<lb/>
thirst, which brings after itself the <hi rend="italic">hydropsy</hi>. A yellow bile spreads<lb/>
itself sometimes over all of the body, and sadness and melancholy<lb/>
usually taking possession of their spirits, it finishes them and puts them<lb/>
in the tomb. . . Our surgeons order them to walk about and take<lb/>
exercise, but the difficulty of breathing prevents this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mentions, also, as another disease peculiar to the islands, &ldquo;a species<lb/>
of paralysis, or swelling of the nerves and tendons, caused by a viscous<lb/>
phlegm . . . . whence it happens that the members, especially the arms<lb/>
and the legs, remain destitute of strength and sometimes deformed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a pretty fair picture of beri-beri--not entirely accurate, of<lb/>
course--or, leaving out paralysis and the suddenness of attack apparently<lb/>
implied by the word &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">surpris</hi>,&rdquo; of the dropsy and debility from any<lb/>
profound anemia, as from hookworm or malaria--the former especially.<lb/>
That it occurred especially among the <hi rend="italic">engagez</hi> would be characteristic<lb/>
of both.</p>
<p>Whether the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; here described was the same disease as<lb/>
that called by the same name in the early years of the colony, is a ques-<lb/>
tion. The writer doubts it. The calling of two diseases by a common<lb/>
name, and the same disease by two names, has wrought much confusion<lb/>
in tropical medicine.</p>
<p>It seems strange that this &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; has been so generally ac-<lb/>
cepted as certainly yellow fever; especially so when that opinion has<lb/>
generally been based solely on the account of it by du Tertre; Breton's<lb/>
books with his expression &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">plus iaunes que des coins</hi>&rdquo; having generally<lb/>
escaped notice. This, indeed, has added little to justify such a conclusion,<lb/>
as it is reported to have occurred from starvation, without any sickness.</p>
<p>Indeed, considering all conditions, not only is it not certain, or even<lb/>
especially probable, that the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; was yellow fever, but it<lb/>
seems highly improbable that it was.</p>

<pb n="187" id="Cb000203"/>
<p>CUBA: FREEDOM FROM YELLOW FEVER BEFORE 1648</p>
<p>We have said that reports of epidemics of what we are quite certain<lb/>
was yellow fever became not uncommon after 1648. The history of<lb/>
Cuba well illustrates this. Finlay, to my mind the most logical and<lb/>
most erudite of the advocates for the American origin of yellow fever,<lb/>
writes (1912, p. 122):</p>
<p>&ldquo;From 1511, in which year Vel&aacute;squez came with 300 residents of Sto.<lb/>
Domingo to settle the Island of Cuba, to the year 1648 or 1649, in which<lb/>
its population increased to a little less than 30,000 inhabitants, in spite<lb/>
of having an important commerce and that the generality of the vessels<lb/>
which sailed from Nombre de Dios and Vera Cruz for the Peninsula or<lb/>
for Sto. Domingo, touched at Habana, there was no notice that any of<lb/>
the inhabitants had suffered on its soil from the grave pestilences which<lb/>
year after year were wont to afflict those who went to the ports of the<lb/>
neighboring continent mentioned above. The principal criterion which<lb/>
we have to recognize that a locality has not suffered before from yellow<lb/>
fever<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> . . . is the aptitude which the generality of the population in such<lb/>
localities manifest to contract the disease when any epidemic of yellow<lb/>
fever comes to invade their territory for the first time.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> With its help we<lb/>
see corroborated our assertion that in the first 138 years of the occupa-<lb/>
tion of this island of Cuba by the European race there has not been<lb/>
manifested in it the pestilence which immediately spread through all<lb/>
the Island, from the year 1649 to 1655, and of whose nature there is no<lb/>
plausible reason to doubt that it was the same yellow fever which<lb/>
subsequently has come to establish here its kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 125) &ldquo;The Island of Cuba, by a singular exception, in<lb/>
spite of its proximity to foci of infection and due, without doubt, to the</p>

to allow a sufficient population susceptible to yellow fever to grow up or come in.<lb/>
The general opinion, however, at that time, 1884, was that a place once infected<lb/>
with yellow fever tended to remain infected unless freed by cold weather or some<lb/>
similar agency.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Finlay credits this idea to Chaill&eacute; of New Orleans, also an able yellow fever<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>benignity of its climate, remained free from the invasion of yellow fever<lb/>
during the 138 years of its settlement by the Spaniards until 1649, in<lb/>
which the pestilence was introduced from the neighboring continent<hi rend="superscript">3</hi><lb/>
and extended over all of the Island, destroying one-third of its inhabi-<lb/>
tants the first year and continuing its ravages to 1655.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering our knowledge of how readily yellow fever is carried by<lb/>
vessels, especially sailing vessels, a reasonable explanation of the freedom<lb/>
of Havana from this disease for 138 years, in spite of a large susceptible<lb/>
population and a large commerce for which it was a port of call, would<lb/>
be either that Havana was &ldquo;uninfectible territory&rdquo;--that is, not infested<lb/>
with <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>; or that the vessels calling there did not, in general, come<lb/>
from ports in which yellow fever prevailed. Both may have been true<lb/>
in the beginning, for the Little Antilles and Yucatan seem, like Havana,<lb/>
to have escaped yellow fever for many years.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi></p>
<p>HAVANA: THE EPIDEMIC OF 1648 OR 1649</p>
<p>For the introduction of yellow fever into Havana, of which Finlay<lb/>
speaks, we quote from Pezuela's <hi rend="italic">Diccionario Geogr&aacute;fico, Estadist&iacute;co,<lb/>
Hist&oacute;rico de la Isla de Cuba</hi> (Madrid, 1863-66, <hi rend="italic">tom</hi>. 3, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. 23): &ldquo;1648.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Peste</hi> of putrid fevers in Havana and in the fleet of Don Juan Pujadas,<lb/>
stationed in the port almost all the summer. Three assessors of gov-<lb/>
ernment died, named successively&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>. one appointed as soon as his<lb/>
predecessor died), &ldquo;an <hi rend="italic">alcalde</hi>, many functionaries, a third part of the<lb/>
garrison and of civilians in the neighborhood, and an even greater<lb/>
proportional number of the crews and passengers of the vessels.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> It sounds strange for Dr. Finlay to ascribe freedom from yellow fever to the<lb/>
benignity of climate. This paper (republished in 1912) was read in November,<lb/>
1884, about three years after he had promulgated the doctrine of the conveyance<lb/>
of yellow fever by the mosquito (<hi rend="italic">A&euml;des (Stegomyia) aegypti</hi>). Possibly he was<lb/>
less firmly convinced of this at that time than, from further investigation, he<lb/>
became afterwards, although I think his belief in it was <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> from the begin-<lb/>
ning--certainly when I knew him in 1899 and 1900 it was so. I think it was not<lb/>
even strengthened by Reed's demonstration of its truth.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> It is worth noting that Finlay, though an earnest advocate of the American<lb/>
origin of yellow fever, believed that it existed in none of the Great Antilles (Porto<lb/>
Rico, Santo Domingo, Cuba, or Jamaica) when they were first visited by Euro-<lb/>
peans, which, indeed, the early history of these islands confirms. He believed,<lb/>
however, that it was brought to Santo Domingo by Caribs, presumably from the<lb/>
mainland, just prior to the great battle of Vega Real, March 24, 1495, after which,<lb/>
following a famine, a great mortality occurred among both the Spaniards and 
the Indians.</p>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
189</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">There is no entry in this book,Pezuela's Diccionario</hi>,for 1649; the next is<lb/>
1653 and about a political change; but in the <hi rend="italic">Historia de la Isla de Cuba</hi>,<lb/>
by the same author (Pezuela, 1868-78, <hi rend="italic">tom</hi>. 2, <hi rend="italic">pp</hi>. 106-109), we find the<lb/>
following: &ldquo;In the spring of 1649, supervened to terrify it&rdquo; (the country)<lb/>
&ldquo;a horrible epidemic. From that of smallpox, which decimated the<lb/>
new-born (<hi rend="italic">nacientes</hi>) pueblos . . . . at the beginning of the sixteenth<lb/>
century, there had not been known other contagions and sicknesses than<lb/>
those inherent to its warm climate and the malignant fevers of the sum-<lb/>
mer of 1620. The records of Governor Villalba neither detailed, nor<lb/>
even explained the symptoms of the sickness which then prevailed in many<lb/>
coastwise settlements of the continent and which was supposedly intro-<lb/>
duced into Havana by vessels from Cartagena and Portobello . . . . A<lb/>
third part of its population was devoured from May to October by a<lb/>
species of putrid fever which carried off those attacked in three days.<lb/>
The therapy, tried gropingly (<hi rend="italic">&aacute; tientas</hi>) by some experimenting physi-<lb/>
cians (<hi rend="italic">facultativos tanteadores</hi>) . . . . against an unknown sickness, aggra-<lb/>
vated instead of curing it . . . . Villalba&rdquo; (the governor) . . . &ldquo;fell sick<lb/>
also in August.&rdquo; He recovered, but his temporary successor, the audi-<lb/>
tor, Molina, died, as also the three licentiates (names given) &ldquo;who, on<lb/>
the death of Molina, successively took his place; an alcalde and many<lb/>
functionaries, a third part of the garrison and of civilians in the neighbor-<lb/>
hood, and an even greater number of the crews and passengers of the<lb/>
squadron. Its general, Don Juan Pujadas, not to change his orders,<lb/>
made the error of stationing it in the infected port.&rdquo; The losses which<lb/>
the garrison suffered by the epidemic were replaced in 1650 by officers<lb/>
and soldiers from Vera Cruz and Cadiz. Pezuela's <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi>, from which<lb/>
this is taken, mentions no sickness in 1648, the year which his <hi rend="italic">Diccionario</hi><lb/>
gives as the date of the epidemic.</p>
<p>Were there one or two epidemics? It does not seem reasonable that<lb/>
the same author, in writing two different accounts of such an event,<lb/>
would make an error of a year in its date. It might be that the infection,<lb/>
and if yellow fever, its vector, was first in the squadron of Pujadas in<lb/>
1648, and that <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> did not sufficiently infest the town to allow a<lb/>
general epidemic therein except in the neighborhood of the <hi rend="italic">flota</hi> until<lb/>
the next year. Yet Pezuela wrote about 220 years after the event and,<lb/>
unless we knew the sources of his information, (apparently the records<lb/>
of Villalba), we cannot deny the possibility of an error in one of his dates.<lb/>
If one notes the parallelism of the two accounts and the similarity--<lb/>
even identity--of phraseology, the most probable conclusion seems to be<lb/>
that they were copied from the same original, or that the manuscripts<lb/>
<pb n="190" id="Cb000206"/>
190<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
from which they were taken had themselves been copied from the same<lb/>
original, and that there was <hi rend="italic">only one epidemic</hi>. Noting the date (1650)<lb/>
at which the levies are recorded as sent to fill the losses of the garrison,<lb/>
one would judge that the epidemic was in 1649, rather than 1648. Also,<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> (<hi rend="italic">tom</hi>, ii, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. 112) states that the fever in Santiago de Cuba in<lb/>
1653 was <hi rend="italic">three</hi> years after the Havana epidemic. Again, if this fever<lb/>
was introduced from the continent, its most probable source, directly<lb/>
and indirectly, had been the epidemic which began in June, 1648, at<lb/>
Campeche. Indeed, Pezuela's <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> says (foot note, <hi rend="italic">tom</hi>, ii, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. 107):<lb/>
&ldquo;This <hi rend="italic">peste</hi> of putrid fevers had afflicted Vera Cruz . . . . and other<lb/>
pueblos of New Spain&rdquo; (Mexico) &ldquo;the preceding summer.&rdquo; This could<lb/>
only refer to our Yucatan epidemic of 1648; hence 1649 seems to be the<lb/>
most probable date for the occurrence of this (single) epidemic in<lb/>
Havana.</p>
<p>One notes, however, the same abundance of buccaneers about Havana<lb/>
in this and the year immediately preceding as were about Campeche,<lb/>
only in greater number; and, as we thought was probable for Campeche,<lb/>
they may have been the introducers of the infection here, directly or<lb/>
indirectly through the <hi rend="italic">flota</hi> of Pujadas.</p>
<p>Let us note three statements in the account of this &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">epid&eacute;mia</hi>:&rdquo;<lb/>
(1) Pezuela corroborates Finlay's assertion that except for smallpox,<lb/>
Cuba had been always notably free from contagions and sicknesses; (2)<lb/>
he states that this sickness was unknown to the physicians, and (3) he<lb/>
alludes to an epidemic, or at least a number, of malignant fevers in the<lb/>
summer of 1620.</p>
<p>HAVANA: MALIGNANT FEVERS OF 1620</p>
<p>Could this sickness of 1620 have been yellow fever? This date is<lb/>
sometimes given as the earliest introduction of yellow fever into Havana,<lb/>
although the writer thinks 1649 is the one generally accepted. Of the<lb/>
year 1620, the <hi rend="italic">Diccionario</hi> of Pezuela, which we have just quoted, says<lb/>
only: &ldquo;1620. With the name of &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Armada de Barlovento</hi>&rsquo; some war<lb/>
vessels destined for the pursuit of pirates in the archipelago of the<lb/>
Antilles began to anchor frequently in the harbor.&rdquo; His <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> (<hi rend="italic">tom</hi>.<lb/>
ii, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. 21) however, gives: "From June an epidemic of pernicious fevers<lb/>
decimated Havana, which lasted to November and carried away many<lb/>
victims from the shipping (<hi rend="italic">flota</hi>) also.&rdquo; This &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">flota</hi>&rdquo; was called &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">la<lb/>
Armadilla</hi>&rdquo;--the Little Armada-and was presumably the same men--<lb/>
tioned in the <hi rend="italic">Diccionario</hi> as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">de Barlovento</hi>.&rdquo; At any rate, it had been<lb/>
<pb n="191" id="Cb000207"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>

chasing pirates off the coast of Venezuela and about Tortuga close to<lb/>
Santo Domingo.</p>
<p>Through the courtesy of Dr. Beato of Havana, by personal communi-<lb/>
cation, which is most gratefully acknowledged, the writer is able to<lb/>
present the mortuary statistics for Havana for this time:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Defunciones</hi></p>
<p>
<table rows="6" cols="3">
<row><cell>A&ntilde;o</cell><cell>1619...................................................</cell><cell>40</cell></row>

</table>
</p> 
<p>A larger number of years had been better; from these one cannot<lb/>
determine the normal number of deaths per year. The mortality in<lb/>
1620 is raised 60 per cent above that in 1619, but it is still higher in 1621,<lb/>
and is nearly as high in 1622 as in 1620. It looks rather as if the number<lb/>
of deaths had been increased for these three years, 1620, 1621, and 1622,<lb/>
which average 64 deaths, while the other three average only 42. Inabil-<lb/>
ity to determine the average annual mortality blocks us; but influenza or<lb/>
malarial fevers would fit this picture better than yellow fever, which,<lb/>
indeed, does not suit. To the writer the picture seems to be that of<lb/>
malarial fevers, severe in 1620 and 1621, and persisting in milder form<lb/>
for some years thereafter, the excess of deaths after 1621 being due to<lb/>
recurrent attacks in individuals weakened by previous attacks and<lb/>
chronic malaria.</p>
<p>The population of Havana at this time, Dr. Beato says, &ldquo;was 4,082,<lb/>
according to the report of the year 1620 sent to His Majesty by the<lb/>
Bishop of the Island, Fray Alonso Enriquez de Almendares.&rdquo; At any<lb/>
rate, then, the mortality of 1620 was a little less than 16 per thousand,<lb/>
even without subtracting the deaths among the garrison and the crews of<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Armadilla</hi>, among whom the fever is said to have had &ldquo;many vic-<lb/>
tims.&rdquo; This is low enough for an ordinary healthful year, although<lb/>
apparently greater than normal for Havana at that time, since it is 60<lb/>
per cent greater than that of the preceding year. Dr. Beato also says<lb/>
that this fever did not excite enough alarm &ldquo;for the authorities to call for<lb/>
rogations or processions.&rdquo; It was not an <hi rend="italic">epidemic</hi> of yellow fever. If<lb/>
it was yellow fever--and there seems no special reason to believe that it<lb/>
was--the vectors were not at that time sufficiently prevalent in Havana<lb/>
to make an epidemic.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>CUBA: EXTENSION OF YELLOW FEVER 1649-55</p>
<p>There is no detailed description of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">epid&eacute;mia</hi>&rdquo; of 1649, but con-<lb/>
sidering (1) its high mortality; (2) its generally rapid progress to death;<lb/>
(3) its prevalence aboard vessels and in Havana, and afterwards in other<lb/>
Cuban towns; (4) its communicability; (5) the exclusion of typhus and<lb/>
all louse-borne diseases on account of the climate; and (6) the known<lb/>
presence of yellow fever in 1648 in Yucatan and in the French Antilles,<lb/>
with which Havana was in communication, directly by Spanish vessels<lb/>
or indirectly by the buccaneers, the writer thinks that this sickness can<lb/>
be identified with reasonable certainty as yellow fever. Not, it is true,<lb/>
with the absolute assurance which we have for the epidemic of 1648 in<lb/>
Yucatan, or that of 1686 in Bahia.</p>
<p>Finlay (1912, p. 122) states that this &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">pestilencia</hi>&rdquo; immediately ex-<lb/>
tended all over the island from the year 1649 to 1655 and that it lasted<lb/>
to 1655 in a recognizable form and much longer in the larval form (the<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">fi&egrave;vre bilieuse inflammatoire</hi>&rdquo; of B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud); and we again quote<lb/>
from Pezuela's <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> (<hi rend="italic">tom</hi>, ii, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. 112): &ldquo;In July and August of this<lb/>
year&rdquo; (1653) &ldquo;the same fevers afflicted Santiago and Bayamo as the capi-<lb/>
tal had suffered three years ago, with equal havoc as in Havana.&rdquo; This<lb/>
implies that no epidemic of yellow fever had visited these places in 1649<lb/>
--else there had not been sufficient susceptible people to support one in<lb/>
1653. That the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; was at least quite generally feared over the<lb/>
island in this year is shown by the measures which Pezuela says were<lb/>
taken to prevent its introduction into the Cuban towns: &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Xelder</hi>&rdquo; (the<lb/>
governor) &ldquo;in order to preserve the capital from a new scourge, agreed<lb/>
with the <hi rend="italic">Cabildo</hi>&rdquo; (of Havana) &ldquo;that all communication with the other<lb/>
towns of the island should be cut off; and they induced the authorities of<lb/>
Trinidad, Sancti Spiritus, Puerto Principe, Baracoa, and Remidios to<lb/>
imitate the same example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ENDEMIC YELLOW FEVER IN HAVANA</p>
<p>Yellow fever finally disappeared from Cuba after 1655 and was rein-<lb/>
troduced in 1761 from Vera Cruz, with the prisoners sent to help build<lb/>
Caba&ntilde;as, when it ravaged the British forces under Pocock and Alber-<lb/>
marle, who that year beseiged and captured the city. From that date<lb/>
it was permanently endemic in Havana until 1901, when, as is well<lb/>
known, it was banished by Gorgas, using sanitary measures based on the<lb/>
knowledge of its conveyance by the mosquito, <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des (Stegomyia) aegypti</hi><lb/>
--the first place in which this was ever done.</p>
<pb n="193" id="Cb000209"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
193</p>
<p>Havana well illustrates that endemic yellow fever does not prevent a<lb/>
town's being prosperous. It was a prosperous and beautiful city during<lb/>
the latter part of the nineteenth century before the last Cuban revolution.<lb/>
Nor was the death rate from yellow fever among the civil population<lb/>
large--with the military it varied with the number of soldiers sent in<lb/>
from Spain. The writer, in 1900, made a careful study of the mortality<lb/>
statistics, which were beautifully kept (Carter, 1900-b). From April 1,<lb/>
1884, to April 1, 1894, ten normal years not affected by the war, the<lb/>
average number of deaths from yellow fever recorded among civilians<lb/>
was 210.4 per annum; the total mortality from all causes during the<lb/>
same period averaged 6,677 per annum; that from tuberculosis 1,492 per<lb/>
annum for the last five years of this period.</p>
<p>This study was confined to civilians, because the number of deaths<lb/>
from yellow fever among the military forces showed extremely wide<lb/>
fluctuations from year to year, due to their varying number and their<lb/>
introduction <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>, direct from Spain, at irregular intervals of time,<lb/>
so that no significant annual average of deaths was determinable.<lb/>
&ldquo;Civilians&rdquo; included all in Havana--Spaniards, Cubans, and foreigners<lb/>
--except soldiers and sailors.</p>
<p>The population of Havana during this time is not recorded, but its<lb/>
size would have influenced very little the number of deaths reported<lb/>
as yellow fever, since deaths of persons native to Havana or long resident<lb/>
therein were rarely--the writer thinks never--so reported. Unques-<lb/>
tionably, a certain number, and it may be in epidemic years a consid-<lb/>
erable number, of young children native to Havana did die of yellow<lb/>
fever, as Guiteras (1888) has shown; but with the doctrine of "Creole<lb/>
immunity by place of birth,&rdquo; at that time held by the laity of Havana<lb/>
and by some of its physicians, such deaths would not have been reported<lb/>
as yellow fever. There were, then, more deaths from yellow fever in<lb/>
Havana than were recorded, but, yellow fever being generally a mild<lb/>
disease among young children, probably no great number.</p>
<p>More important than the size of the population of Havana, as affecting<lb/>
the number of deaths recorded as yellow fever, was the amount of immi-<lb/>
gration. The records showed that during the ten years studied this<lb/>
averaged from 15,000 to 20,000 per annum, practically all from Spain or<lb/>
Spanish overseas possessions--the Balearic and Canary Islands. These<lb/>
immigrants, of course, furnished nearly all of the deaths reported as yel-<lb/>
low fever. A considerable number of them, however, especially those<lb/>
from the Canaries, did not remain in Havana.</p>
<p>Obviously, then, even with a large immigration of susceptible people,<lb/>
<pb n="194" id="Cb000210"/>
194<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
yellow fever was a small factor in the total mortality of Havana, and<lb/>
while its presence was a handicap to the city's trade, yet this flourished<lb/>
and prospered in spite of the disease.</p>
<p>It may be of interest to sanitarians to state here that a rather careful<lb/>
estimate made at this time seemed to show that only about one out of<lb/>
ten or twelve of these Spanish immigrants (<hi rend="italic">Peninsulares</hi>) who remained<lb/>
in Havana five full years were recorded as having suffered from yellow<lb/>
fever during that time; although we believe that all such had had it,<lb/>
and practically all claimed to have had the &ldquo;fever of acclimatization.&rdquo;<lb/>
Much pains was taken, and the data used in this investigation are<lb/>
believed to have been reliable. The sources were: (1) the books regis-<lb/>
tering the arrival of the <hi rend="italic">Peninsulares</hi>; (2) the records of the yearly regis-<lb/>
tration of their <hi rend="italic">c&eacute;dulas</hi>, by which we could tell whether the man registered<lb/>
was in Havana at the dates, a year apart, of these inspections; (3) the<lb/>
books of the Sanitary Office reporting communicable diseases; (4) the<lb/>
registers of the hospitals; and finally (5) the records of the cemeteries.<lb/>
Nearly all those recorded as having yellow fever developed it within the<lb/>
first two or two and a half years after arrival. Those recorded with yel-<lb/>
low fever after the third year were few indeed.</p>
<p>Consideration of the findings in this study--indicating that a large ma-<lb/>
jority of yellow fever cases escaped recognition, even in Havana--was<lb/>
instrumental in the change of plan, in June, 1905, of Gorgas' yellow fever<lb/>
campaign in Panama, transferring the emphasis to control of the insect<lb/>
host instead of the human host, which previously had been the main<lb/>
objective.</p>
<p>OTHER CARIBBEAN REGIONS AND BRAZIL</p>
<p>Leaving Cuba, the history of which implies the existence of yellow<lb/>
fever in Vera Cruz and other places in the Caribbean area in 1648 and<lb/>
thereafter, we find, in immediately succeeding years, fairly frequent<lb/>
mention of epidemics in this region. Some of these, however, have been<lb/>
accepted as yellow fever on insufficient evidence,<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> and, while it is certain</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> An instance of this is the account which B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud (<hi rend="italic">op. cit</hi>., p. 30) gives<lb/>
of an epidemic on the island of St. Lucia, which, from his report, has become<lb/>
somewhat famous in the annals of yellow fever by reason of its extraordinary<lb/>
mortality. Of this he says, citing du Tertre as his authority: &ldquo;In 1665 an English<lb/>
squadron which was in good health took possession of <hi rend="italic">Sainte-Lucie</hi> and placed<lb/>
there a garrison of 1,500 men; by the month of January of the following year this<lb/>
garrison was reduced to 89 as the result of a violent epidemic of yellow fever.&rdquo; <lb/>
He does not locate the passage in du Tertre from which this is taken, but a careful</p>
<pb n="195" id="Cb000211"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
195</p>
<p>that the disease continued to prevail in this region, it is not until 1686<lb/>
that we find another extensive epidemic fully described. In this year<lb/>
appeared in Brazil the great epidemic of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">a bicha</hi>&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> the account of which,</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>search of this author's work shows only the following allusion to this disastrous<lb/>
occupation of St. Lucia (du Tertre, 1667-71, vol. iii, pp. 243-244): &ldquo;While these<lb/>
piracies (brigandages) were going on in the islands, to the great injury of the Com-<lb/>
pany and the inhabitants of these islands, six deputies from the Governor and the<lb/>
inhabitants of the island of <hi rend="italic">Sainte-Lucie</hi> arrived in a boat at Martinique, and<lb/>
declared, on their part . . . that they had taken possession of that island believing<lb/>
that they were doing no wrong: but that God had made known to them that they<lb/>
had usurped the rights of others, by the punishments which he had visited upon<lb/>
them, which was (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) such that dysentery (<hi rend="italic">le flux de sang</hi>), famine, wars and the<lb/>
continual incursions of the savages had reduced them from 1,500 to 89, and very<lb/>
humbly prayed these gentlemen to take back this island and all that belonged to<lb/>
them, and to give them boats to transport them to another land.&rdquo; He adds that<lb/>
an expedition for this purpose was made ready, but on arrival, January 18, 1666,<lb/>
found the island abandoned, the inhabitants having been taken off by an English<lb/>
pirate. While yellow fever may well have been among the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">chastimens</hi>&rdquo; suffered<lb/>
by these renegades, there is nothing in du Tertre's account to identify it, still less<lb/>
to warrant charging against it the whole of the mortality.</p>
<p>B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud is among the greatest of the systematic writers of his genera-<lb/>
tion, combining most happily his own experience with extensive and well digested<lb/>
research in the experiences of others. He ranks high even among the great French<lb/>
writers on yellow fever. Yet he is, I think, entirely too prone to accept any<lb/>
epidemic, especially if occurring in the Americas, as yellow fever: that is, his<lb/>
personal equation in this matter is positive.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">6</hi> The writer is informed by Dr. E. J. Scannell, of the International Health<lb/>
Board (personal communication) that this name &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bicho</hi>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bicha</hi>&rdquo; (worm or<lb/>
beast) is now vulgarly used in certain parts of Brazil for dysentery. Apparently<lb/>
it is a survival from the past, when intestinal worms, found at autopsy, were sup-<lb/>
posed to be the cause of the disease. In the island of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; we find that in<lb/>
the seventeenth century the same name, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bichos no cu</hi>&rdquo; (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">no cu</hi>&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;in the<lb/>
breech&rdquo;) was applied to a conglomerate group of diseases in which dysentery<lb/>
was prominent. Also, Sigaud (1844) refers to a disease &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bicho</hi>,&rdquo; prevalent in Brazil,<lb/>
which, from his description, may have been, or included, <hi rend="italic">schistosomiasis mansoni</hi>.</p>
<p>That a name of this significance should be applied to yellow fever seems remark-<lb/>
able. The explanation suggested by Dr. Scannell, and which seems reasonable, is<lb/>
that, autopsies having been made on some of those dead of yellow fever--because<lb/>
it was a strange disease--intestinal parasites were found--as would almost cer-<lb/>
tainly happen, and that from this came the name &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">a bicha</hi>.&rdquo; This suggestion finds<lb/>
some support in the account which Dr. Jo&atilde;o Ferreira da Rosa, in his <hi rend="italic">Trattado Unico<lb/>
da Constitui&ccedil;am Pestilencial de Pernambuco</hi> (1694) gives of an autopsy made in<lb/>
that epidemic-so far as we know, the first autopsy on a yellow fever victim that<lb/>
is recorded. The &ldquo;anatomy&rdquo; was performed by Antonio Brebon, a ship's surgeon,<lb/>
whose findings are given as recited under oath in support of his claim to have dis-<lb/>
covered the cure of &ldquo;this contagion.&rdquo; He &ldquo;found the liver corrupted in the</p>

<p>by da Rocha Pitta (1730) is almost as good as that of Cogolludo in<lb/>
Yucatan.</p>
<p>According to da Rocha Pitta, himself a Bahia man, the epidemic<lb/>
developed first in 1686 in Olinda--adjacent to Recife--whence it was<lb/>
introduced the same year into Bahia, where there was a severe and gen-<lb/>
eral epidemic--evidently in virgin soil. After some years of prevalence,<lb/>
the disease seems to have died out in Brazil, to be reintroduced in 1849,<lb/>
from either New Orleans or Havana.</p>
<p>It seems possible that this epidemic may have been introduced into<lb/>
Brazil from the Cape Verde islands by the fleet of Gomez Freyre de<lb/>
Andrada. This fleet, leaving Lisbon early in 1685, had stopped at the<lb/>
Cape Verde islands--&ldquo;a place notoriously unhealthy,&rdquo;--and en route<lb/>
thence to Brazil had lost many men of a sickness. In Brazil they<lb/>
went first to Maranham and later--we do not know how much later--<lb/>
to Recife for refitting. It was after this that the epidemic broke out in<lb/>
Recife, but we do not know the interval, nor do we know the nature of<lb/>
the sickness in Andrada's fleet. Hence, that this was the origin of the<lb/>
Brazilian epidemic is only a possibility-not at all established by the<lb/>
evidence we have. Certainly other avenues of infection were not lack-<lb/>
ing, and indeed, unless the insect vector were absent, or at least insuffi-<lb/>
cient, in earlier years, it is difficult to account for the late appearance of<lb/>
yellow fever in Brazil.</p>
<p>In 1690 began in Martinique an epidemic of which we have a full<lb/>
account by P&egrave;re Labat (1722). It was brought quite certainly from<lb/>
Recife to Martinique by the <hi rend="italic">Oriflamme</hi>, a French war vessel which<lb/>
had cleared from. Bangkok, but had touched at Pernambuco. Because<lb/>
of this origin, the epidemic, which spread generally over the West Indies<lb/>
and the continental shores of the Caribbean, became known as the &ldquo;epi-<lb/>
demic of the <hi rend="italic">Oriflamme</hi>,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>.&rdquo; Indeed it gave the latter<lb/>
name, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>,&rdquo; to the disease for a long time and over a wide area,<lb/>
much of which was infected from other sources and with a fever abso-<lb/>
lutely unknown to Siam.</p>

stomach, &ldquo;a quantity of viscous humor of a black color like soot.&rdquo; Yet in spite of<lb/>
these findings, from which we, of the present day, fairly surmise the cause of death,<lb/>
he is chiefly impressed by the finding of worms (&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">lombrigas</hi>&rdquo;) in the intestines, and<lb/>
announces these as the cause of the disease. His &ldquo;remedy&rdquo;" includes &ldquo;certain<lb/>
potions from the use of which the sick cast out the worms by mouth and by the<lb/>
lower way.&rdquo; It is only fair to add that Ferreira da Rosa accepts neither the<lb/>
cause nor the cure.</p>
<pb n="197" id="Cb000213"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
197</p>
<p>From this date on the disease is generally recognized--at least when<lb/>
occurring in epidemics--and there is such abundant record of epidemics,<lb/>
too numerous to mention, that it seems unnecessary to follow them up.<lb/>
It was, however, some years before the name &ldquo;yellow fever&rdquo; came into<lb/>
general use as distinguishing this disease from malaria. The earliest<lb/>
use of &ldquo;yellow fever&rdquo; in this sense seems to have been in 1750 in Bar-<lb/>
bados by Griffith Hughes, though long after that we still find other<lb/>
writers using &ldquo;yellow fever&rdquo; in the older sense. In these years of con-<lb/>
fused nomenclature we find this disease described under many names.<lb/>
Most often these refer to the place--or supposed place--or origin, as<lb/>
&ldquo;fever of Olinda,&rdquo; &ldquo;epidemic of the <hi rend="italic">Oriflamme</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;fever<lb/>
of Bulam;&rdquo; but sometimes they are of other derivation, as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">a bicha</hi>&rdquo; in<lb/>
Brazil. There was also used at one time on the south shore of the<lb/>
Caribbean (Ulloa, 1748) a name descriptive, indeed, but of the epidemi-<lb/>
ology of the disease, not of any appearance or symptom. This was<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">chapetonada</hi>,&rdquo; because the fever was apparently confined to &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">chape-<lb/>
tones</hi>&rdquo;--newly arrived Europeans.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi></p>
<p>The name finally adopted for this disease by the Spaniards, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">v&oacute;mito<lb/>
prieto</hi>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">vomito negro</hi>,&rdquo; more distinctive than the English name &ldquo;yel-<lb/>
low fever,&rdquo; is quite certainly older. The fever that came to Havana<lb/>
in 1671 was stated to be so known in Vera Cruz, whence it came.<lb/>
There is a statement by Ulloa (1748) implying that this name was ap-<lb/>
plied in 1729 to this fever at Cartagena de las Indias and at Santa Marta,<lb/>
and presumably at Porto Bello, where it had long been known even if<lb/>
not named. This was the fever that &ldquo;caused many losses in the fleet of<lb/>
Pintado&rdquo; and was carried by it to Cadiz, producing the epidemic of 1730,<lb/>
believed to have been the first entry of yellow fever into Europe.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">7</hi> As if to show that there is no new thing under the sun, or rather the universal<lb/>
likeness in the minds of men, this was repeated in the name &ldquo;society fever&rdquo; of<lb/>
Jacksonville, Florida, in the spring of 1888, because the fever there attacked<lb/>
especially the northern tourists new-come to the town.</p>

<pb n="198" id="Cb000214"/>
<p>We think that we have shown from historical and epidemiological data<lb/>
that in only two regions, tropical America and West Africa, were the<lb/>
climatic and sociological conditions such that yellow fever could, in<lb/>
early times, have been permanently endemic, and that, with the earth as<lb/>
we have known it in historic times, in one of these two this disease, as we<lb/>
now know it, must have developed.</p>
<p>We have presented such data, negative, it is true, but we think con-<lb/>
vincing, to show that yellow fever was not present prior to the coming of<lb/>
the Spaniards in those parts of the Americas in which the conditions<lb/>
were suited for its permanent endemicity--the Maya countries, and the<lb/>
lowlands of the Aztec Empire. Nor have any data been found to induce<lb/>
us to believe that it existed at this time in other parts of the Americas--<lb/>
the West India Islands or the Caribbean coast of Central America east of<lb/>
the Mayas or elsewhere--none of which, indeed, offered such suitable<lb/>
conditions for the continuance of this infection as the two regions first<lb/>
named.</p>
<p>If, then, the data presented are such as to limit the origin of this disease<lb/>
to the two great regions mentioned and to exonerate the New World as<lb/>
the place of origin of yellow fever, West Africa becomes the <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi><lb/>
alternative. This deduction is based on historical and epidemiological<lb/>
evidence alone. If, in addition, we consider the argument for Africa's<lb/>
being the place of development of <hi rend="italic">Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti</hi>, and the<lb/>
comparative reactions to yellow fever of negroes and amerinds, this<lb/>
conclusion is strengthened--we consider much strengthened.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is purposed to examine such historical evidence as we<lb/>
have on West Africa, to see what light it throws, positive or negative,<lb/>
on this question. It seems advisable to limit this inquiry as to the early<lb/>
presence of yellow fever in Africa both in time and place.</p>
<p>In time we need not go beyond 1648, because we know that in that<lb/>
year yellow fever occurred in America, in Yucatan and the French<lb/>
Antilles. Hence, its presence in Africa later than this might have been<lb/>
due to an importation from America.</p>

<pb n="199" id="Cb000215"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
199</p>
<p>AREA TO BE EXAMINED</p>
<p>For a possible place of origin of yellow fever in Africa we have limited<lb/>
our quest to West Africa. This because, within historical times, the<lb/>
disease has never been known to be established in any other part of this<lb/>
continent, although one thinks that, were the causative organism intro-<lb/>
duced, the eastern coast of Africa now presents, and may have long<lb/>
presented, all the other conditions necessary for the permanent ende-<lb/>
micity of this disease--possibly as much so as the west. Nevertheless,<lb/>
it has not been noted on the east coast.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Senegal and Gambia</hi></p>
<p>On the west coast, one feels like limiting the area to be examined<lb/>
approximately to the Gulf of Guinea, say from Sierra Leone to the mouth<lb/>
of the Congo. It might be extended north to the Great Desert, as yellow<lb/>
fever has frequently been noted in Gambia and Senegal. The epidemics<lb/>
here, however, have, in general, lasted only one or two seasons each.<lb/>
There seems, then, the same reason to exclude this part of the African<lb/>
coast from our inquiry as there is for excluding Louisiana and South<lb/>
Carolina from that in America. In both regions there may have been<lb/>
many epidemics, but in neither has the disease shown a tendency to<lb/>
become permanently endemic. Since in these countries, Senegal and<lb/>
Gambia, <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> have probably existed for a very long time, epidemics<lb/>
may have occurred there from time to time in prehistoric or early<lb/>
historic days as they have done since yellow fever was there recognized.<lb/>
Whether the frequent disappearances of the infection on this part of the<lb/>
African coast were due to climatic conditions or to failure of the human<lb/>
host, or possibly to a combination of the two, may be a question. To<lb/>
whatever cause or causes due, one knows of no reason to believe that con-<lb/>
ditions were more favorable to the permanence of yellow fever here in<lb/>
prehistoric than in modern times. Probably they were less so, as com-<lb/>
munications along the coast and with the hinterland by river have been<lb/>
much better since European factories were established there than in<lb/>
times past, and in late years railways have been built, which are believed<lb/>
to have played a part in the spread of recent epidemics of yellow fever<lb/>
(Gouzien, 1922). The hinterland of which we have spoken, is, and for<lb/>
a very long time has been, quite thickly populated; and obviously, the<lb/>
greater the number of communities brought into communication with<lb/>
each other, and the larger the size of such communities, the greater is<lb/>
the chance of the permanence of this infection.</p>

<p>202<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>With the establishment of the European (French and English) &ldquo;fac-<lb/>
tories" on this coast, the trade routes, east and west, between the hinter-<lb/>
land and this coast greatly developed. Prior to this the greater part of<lb/>
the commerce passed north and south; north with the Desert tribes of<lb/>
the Sahara, and through the Sahara with the Barbary States: south with<lb/>
the Soudan, and beyond it, possibly even to the hinterland of the Gulf<lb/>
of Guinea.</p>
<p>Jenn&eacute; and Timbuktu, both in the northern Soudan, were the com-<lb/>
mercial centers for the concentration and distribution of this trade.<lb/>
That distributed from Timbuktu was practically all going north and<lb/>
south. To the north it was carried in caravans by the Desert tribes,<lb/>
the &ldquo;Azanegues&rdquo; of Azurara--the modern Tuaregs. To the south, down<lb/>
the valley of the Niger, from which river Timbuktu is about twelve miles<lb/>
distant, it was carried by a people of the Soudan, the Mossi, &ldquo;greatly<lb/>
employed in trading.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>
<p>Jenn&eacute;, from which the name &ldquo;Guinea&rdquo; is derived, is older, and, in<lb/>
earlier times, say up to 1200 or 1300 A. D. at least, was more important<lb/>
than Timbuktu. It is nearer the coast; and although its trade was north<lb/>
and south, it was east and west as well--hence to and from the coast.<lb/>
This east and west distribution of its trade made Jenn&eacute; the metropolis<lb/>
for this part of the west coast, and during the fourteenth and fifteenth<lb/>
centuries gave its name, Guinea, to all of it from Cape Bojador (Bogador)<lb/>
south. Unless one keeps this in mind he will be very much confused by<lb/>
some of the early chroniclers.</p>
<p>Salt going south, slaves, ostrich feathers, and gold coming north in<lb/>
exchange, were the staples of this traffic, that of salt being especially<lb/>
important.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Gulf of Guinea</hi></p>
<p>On the coasts of the Gulf of Guinea, taking this section as a whole, say<lb/>
from Sierra Leone to the mouth of the Congo, yellow fever appears to</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Marmol (1667, vol. 3, p. 75), in the seventeenth century, places this people<lb/>
further to the south and west: about 140 leagues to the interior from Cape Palmas<lb/>
in Upper Guinea, below Cape Verde.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The theory of the need of negroes for salt was that the intense heat of the<lb/>
Soudan--which had already blackened their skins and crinkled their hair--would,<lb/>
without this preservative, lead to &ldquo;corruption of their blood and decay of their<lb/>
bodies,&rdquo; and their thick lips and fleshy noses--compared with the thin-lipped,<lb/>
aquiline features of the desert dwellers--were instanced as this process hardly<lb/>
restrained even by the salt consumed. This is given, and with credence, by the<lb/>
early Portuguese from the reports of the Azanegue salt merchants (Ramusio,<lb/>
1563-83, vol. i).</p>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
203</p>
<p>have been continuously, or well nigh continuously, endemic since it was<lb/>
first reported as being there in 1793 (&ldquo;fever of Bulam&rdquo;). This being the<lb/>
case, it seems obvious that the sociological, climatic, and biological<lb/>
conditions there were such, in modern times, as were suited to insure its<lb/>
permanence. And they seem to have undergone little change within<lb/>
historic times which would affect the existence of yellow fever. We<lb/>
believe <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des aegypti</hi> to have been long present, and since we have known<lb/>
this region, it has been thickly settled and with large, or very large, towns.<lb/>
Their inhabitants were great traders, hence with much intercommunica-<lb/>
tion among themselves. Save for increased communication by sea--<lb/>
with the outside world and with each other--there has been, one thinks,<lb/>
little change in historic times affecting the existence of yellow fever<lb/>
among them. Hence, if present at any previous time, it should have<lb/>
remained permanently endemic.</p>
<p>RECORDS</p>
<p>The history of this part of West Africa presents rather a contrast than<lb/>
an analogy with that of those parts of America which we have discussed.<lb/>
The native records of Mexico, the Maya country, and Peru, although<lb/>
scanty, are reliable and fairly complete for a period long before the<lb/>
advent of Europeans. There are absolutely no native records for this<lb/>
part of Africa. For its history, then, we must rely entirely upon Euro-<lb/>
pean accounts, and even these show contrast rather than likeness to<lb/>
those for America.</p>
<p>The history of the voyages of discovery of Africa are extremely good,<lb/>
especially those of the Italian navigators in the service of Prince Henry,<lb/>
as given by Ramusio. The Chronicle of Eannes de Azurara, who was<lb/>
deputed by Prince Henry to write an account of them, also is full, definite,<lb/>
and unquestionably correct, at least as things were reported to him. It<lb/>
is a contemporaneous account, completed, or rather stopped, in 1453,<lb/>
and covers the time up to and including 1448, the &ldquo;Voyage of Vallarte,<lb/>
the Dane,&rdquo; of that year, being the last recorded. Barros, too, gives a<lb/>
very full account of the history of the Portuguese in West Africa, not<lb/>
so full as Azurara's, indeed, for the time the latter covers, but continuing<lb/>
the history well beyond the early settlements. His account, we think,<lb/>
is derived mainly from official documents--that is, at third hand. We<lb/>
think his history is in the same class as that of Herrera for Mexico.<lb/>
These accounts compare fairly well with the accounts of the Span-<lb/>
ish voyages of discovery in America, but are far less informative<lb/>
sociologically.</p>
<pb n="204" id="Cb000220"/>
<p>204<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>The history of the settlements themselves is far otherwise. In<lb/>
America, Europeans settled in large numbers and in many places,<lb/>
Hispaniola, Panama, Mexico, Yucatan, Guatemala, Bogot&aacute;, Peru, etc.,<lb/>
and established Spanish colonies--that is, permanent Spanish com-<lb/>
munities. Much of the plateau country in America was healthy. Here<lb/>
the Spaniards mainly settled, and it early supported a considerable and<lb/>
permanent Spanish population mixed with the indigenes. Indeed, no<lb/>
great complaint of unhealthfulness is made of much of the lowlands until<lb/>
malaria appeared, and on them, too, there were early considerable<lb/>
flourishing and permanent Spanish settlements. These were true<lb/>
colonies, immigrants coming to stay permanently and their descendants<lb/>
to stay after them.</p>
<p>There was thus intense European interest in the American settlements,<lb/>
and much was written about them. Peter Martyr d'Anghierra trans-<lb/>
lated for the Pope practically all the personal letters of Columbus to<lb/>
himself, giving Columbus' account of the New World. Oviedo made the<lb/>
determination to write his great history in 1493--within one year of the<lb/>
discovery. Herrera was appointed royal historiographer for the<lb/>
New World and has given us a very full account based on official docu-<lb/>
ments, supplemented, it may be, to an extent, by his imagination. Las<lb/>
Casas, early present on the ground, began his history as a labor of love<lb/>
for the Indians. Probably thirty titles would scarcely include the early<lb/>
accounts of the Spanish settlements in America, by eye-witnesses, or by<lb/>
writers who received accounts from eye-witnesses.</p>
<p>The early European settlements on the West African mainland, how-<lb/>
ever, were all small, being mere trading posts, rather than true colonies.<lb/>
Angola and, to a less extent, S&atilde;o Jorge da Mina came nearest to being<lb/>
colonies. Moreover, even the trading stations were rarely any great<lb/>
distance inland, not even up the rivers.</p>
<p>The settlements on the African islands were, indeed, different.<lb/>
These were true colonies; and we are more apt to have note of a disease in<lb/>
a true colony than in a trading post, especially if the disease be one for-<lb/>
eign to the mother country of the colonists. Yet even the island colo-<lb/>
nies were not large and, except in the first settlement, Europeans must<lb/>
have arrived in small numbers at a time, which would render little<lb/>
noticeable among them any endemic disease producing immunity by a<lb/>
single attack. An <hi rend="italic">epidemic</hi> of such a disease, endemically established,<lb/>
would be <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>. Their histories, too, are scant and mainly com-<lb/>
mercial, with nothing like the wealth of sociological information we have<lb/>
on early Spanish America.</p>
<pb n="205" id="Cb000221"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
205</p>
<p>Obviously, the negative value of the histories for these two regions,<lb/>
Africa and America, is very different. For the native records, when<lb/>
neither the Nahuatl nor the Mayan records made mention of anything<lb/>
that could be regarded as yellow fever, the writer made the deduction<lb/>
that yellow fever had not existed, because the records are of such char-<lb/>
acter that he felt convinced that an epidemic of yellow fever, had it<lb/>
occurred, would have been recorded. The fact of there being no native<lb/>
records of an epidemic in Africa would in no wise warrant such a deduc-<lb/>
tion, as there is no native record of anything.</p>
<p>The European history of this part of Africa, too, is scant and, as we<lb/>
have stated, mainly of discovery and commerce; hence, its failing to<lb/>
mention or give details of sickness would be far less significant than a<lb/>
similar omission from the more complete American histories.</p>
<p>DIFFICULTIES OF RECOGNITION OF YELLOW FEVER IN AFRICA</p>
<p>Moreover, had the histories been equally good, yellow fever occurring<lb/>
in Africa had been less apt to be mentioned than in America. It would<lb/>
not have been noticed among the negroes, especially if in a permanent<lb/>
endemic focus. Among Indians, as happened in Yucatan, it was as<lb/>
severe as among whites, and <hi rend="italic">compelled</hi> notice. At no place on the Afri-<lb/>
can mainland was there, in early times, any considerable number of<lb/>
Europeans, and these, except at first settlement, generally came there a<lb/>
few at a time. In early times, too, many of the colonists accounted<lb/>
white were of mixed Portuguese and negro descent, among whom the<lb/>
recognition of yellow fever had been, it may be, well nigh as difficult as<lb/>
among pure negroes.</p>
<p>At the island of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; the Portuguese population was greater,<lb/>
but, except at the beginning of the settlement, none of this immigration<lb/>
came in large numbers at one time and, as we have said, it is only among<lb/>
Europeans, and among new-come Europeans, if the infection were fairly<lb/>
continuous in a place, that yellow fever would be noted. Thus, because<lb/>
of the mild reaction of the negro to yellow fever, and the small numbers<lb/>
of susceptible whites exposed at one time, the manifestations of yellow<lb/>
fever in Africa would be decidedly less definitive than in the New World.<lb/>
Certainly, one would not here expect the clear-cut histories that we have<lb/>
of the fever of 1648 in Yucatan or that of 1686 in Bahia, which, indeed,<lb/>
are not only recognizable, but unmistakable.</p>
<p>Moreover, malaria was very prevalent and very severe in West Africa,<lb/>
and it is improbable that we could, from the descriptions of early times,<lb/>
differentiate yellow fever from the omnipresent and ever-present malaria,<lb/>
<pb n="206" id="Cb000222"/>
206<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
even among whites. Indeed, this was not done until 1778, by Schotte,<lb/>
at St. Louis de Senegal, when he had an opportunity to observe a severe<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">epidemic</hi> of yellow fever in a considerable body of British troops.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi></p>
<p>On all three of these counts, then, (1) the small number of Europeans,<lb/>
among whom only could yellow fever be recognized, (2) the prevalence<lb/>
of severe malaria, making it difficult of recognition even among them,<lb/>
and (3) the paucity of historical record, it seems obvious that not record-<lb/>
ing yellow fever in Africa would be of far less negative significance than<lb/>
the same would be for America.</p>
<p>CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFICATION OF YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>It is not easy to determine what criteria we must look to here as<lb/>
indicating the presence of yellow fever. The mere occurrence of sickness<lb/>
among newly-arrived Europeans, and even of severe sickness, is not<lb/>
sufficient, especially here, on account of the prevalence of malaria. If<lb/>
such a sickness showed a very high case mortality or a very high com-<lb/>
munity mortality in a short time, this might be taken as indicative of<lb/>
the more deadly infection, especially if it died out in a short time--<lb/>
determinable by the size of the community and the introduction of new-<lb/>
comers. A positive determination in such a case, however, would re-<lb/>
quire the evidence to be full, definite, and reliable--a thing we are little<lb/>
likely to get here at these times--and a very careful judgment in the<lb/>
weighing of it.</p>
<p>Possibly the best criterion is the occurrence of epidemics of high fatal-<lb/>
ity aboard ships on the high seas after having been in African ports,<lb/>
especially so if the sickness continued to spread among the crews for any<lb/>
length of time. Also, should we find evidence of the immunization of<lb/>
Europeans to a severe prevalent sickness by a previous attack of an<lb/>
apparently similar illness or from having lived in a place where such a<lb/>
sickness prevailed, this evidence would be of value in proportion to its<lb/>
definiteness and reliability. It would, however, be complicated by the<lb/>
presence of malaria, repeated attacks of which occasionally give a fair<lb/>
degree of immunity to itself; and the occurrence of a severe attack of</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> In fact, it can hardly be said that Schotte differentiated the two diseases, for<lb/>
though he gave to the yellow fever that he saw a distinctive name (<hi rend="italic">synochus<lb/>
atrabiliosa</hi>), and left a description which is to us definitive, he considered it an<lb/>
intensified form of the malarial fevers. Lind reports outbreaks of what may have<lb/>
been yellow fever in Senegal and Gambia in earlier years, but there is still some<lb/>
question which of these--if any--were yellow fever. Lind himself, an erudite<lb/>
man, and with much experience in tropical diseases, considered all the above<lb/>
malarial fevers.</p>
<pb n="207" id="Cb000223"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
207</p>
<p>malaria, whether in one immune to yellow fever or not, might well be<lb/>
taken for yellow fever. The data to be derived from this, then, would be<lb/>
far less satisfactory than in a place where malaria was less prevalent and<lb/>
less severe.</p>
<p>Just as in modern times there has never been an epidemic of yellow fever<lb/>
in this part of Africa comparable to the epidemics which have been of<lb/>
frequent occurrence in the Caribbean region, so we would not expect, in<lb/>
early times, to have had one here like that of Yucatan in 1648 or of Bahia<lb/>
in 1686; and, except by the distinctive features which it shows in frank<lb/>
epidemics, we can hardly expect to be able to identify yellow fever with<lb/>
certainty, from scant historical records, even where it may be present,<lb/>
and indeed, highly prevalent. We begin our examination of Africa,<lb/>
then, recognizing that positive evidence of early yellow fever will be less<lb/>
likely discoverable, and negative evidence of less weight than in the<lb/>
New World.</p>

<pb n="208" id="Cb000224"/>
<p>It has been plead that if yellow fever had been so long present in<lb/>
Africa, Europeans should have had cognizance of it long before they did,<lb/>
because their acquaintance with Africa dates from the dawn of Euro-<lb/>
pean history. One might almost as well say that if it had been long<lb/>
present in America, it should have been known to Europeans from the<lb/>
time of Lief Ericson. That we have history of Africa from extremely<lb/>
early times is indeed true; but up to the latter half of the fifteenth cen-<lb/>
tury we have none for the part of Africa that we suspect of being the<lb/>
place of origin of this infection. Egyptian history, of course, goes back<lb/>
to the very early times, and with Egypt, I presume, we should include,<lb/>
to an extent and indirectly, Nubia and Ethiopia, to the south. Africa<lb/>
north of the Great Desert, the so-called &ldquo;Barbary States,&rdquo; was also well<lb/>
known; part of it to the Greeks, all to the Romans. Arab traders from<lb/>
the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf in the tenth century went down the<lb/>
east coast as far as Mozambique and Madagascar, founding settle-<lb/>
ments, and bringing much of the country into limited and indirect com-<lb/>
munication with the Levant. There is also record of a much earlier<lb/>
expedition down this coast, that of Eudoxus of Cyzicus, about 130 B. C.<lb/>
However, all this relates to parts of Africa where, in historic times, yellow<lb/>

<p>For the west coast of Africa, it is a question what credence should<lb/>
be given to the reported expedition of the Phoenicians, made for Pharaoh<lb/>
Necho, 600 B. C., from the Red Sea down the east coast, returning<lb/>
through the Mediterranean. This voyage is reported to have lasted<lb/>
over two years, the expedition stopping ashore and raising crops of<lb/>
grain for revictualling. The Greek historians and geographers are<lb/>
quoted as rejecting it, and on the very grounds which would make us<lb/>
inclined to accept it--that making the turn of Africa, they had had the<lb/>
sun on their right. Herodotus, knowing of the sun always to the south<lb/>
of the place of observation, naturally believed it would be on the left of<lb/>
the observer going to the west. South of the equator, rounding the<lb/>

Cape of Good Hope, of course, the contrary would be the case (Saco,<lb/>
1879).</p>
<p>In Walckenaer's <hi rend="italic">Collection des Relations de Voyages . . . en . . . l'Afrique</hi><lb/>
(1842, vol. ix, pp. 379-380) is an interesting statement as to the presence,<lb/>
in upper Guinea, of certain pottery beads, the so-called &ldquo;aigris&rdquo; beads,<lb/>
which are accounted of Phoenecian origin. A. B. Ellis, too, in his<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">History of the Gold Coast of West Africa</hi> (1893), states that near<lb/>
Wassaw, in the Gold Coast, where neither Dutch nor Portuguese had<lb/>
ever been, old workings are found in two tunnels following gold veins.<lb/>
He makes mention also of &ldquo;aggry&rdquo; beads which, he is told, are charac-<lb/>
teristic of Sidon, as being occasionally found in gold-producing districts,<lb/>
and only in such districts. Other modern writers mention these beads,<lb/>
and there seems to be rather general agreement that they are occasion-<lb/>
ally found in the Gold Coast and its hinterland. Naturally, the above<lb/>
are meant to imply more than a mere expedition, rather a commercial<lb/>
intercourse, probably especially for gold.</p>
<p>Better authenticated is the voyage of Hanno, the Carthagenian,<lb/>
about 570 B.C., going south from the Pillars of Hercules down the west<lb/>
coast to &ldquo;the Southern Horn,&rdquo; and returning by the same route. The<lb/>
account we have of this voyage is &ldquo;The Periplus of Hanno,&rdquo; a Greek<lb/>
translation, made about 300 B. C., from a Punic inscription upon a<lb/>
bronze tablet found in the Temple of Moloch at Carthage. It naturally,<lb/>
then, is not diffuse in its detail (see Bunbury, 1883, vol. i, p. 322; and<lb/>
Saco, 1879, appendix 2). Modern writers have tentatively fixed the<lb/>
&ldquo;Southern Horn,&rdquo; the southern limit of Hanno's voyage, as a headland<lb/>
of Sherboro Island, Sierra Leone. Here he turned back, he states, from<lb/>
failure of provisions, but one judges also in awe of the supposedly super-<lb/>
natural manifestations which showed about the end of his journey.<lb/>
There is indisputable internal evidence, in the extremely brief account<lb/>
that we have of this, that Hanno sailed along the forest region of the<lb/>
West African coast well south of the Great Desert, and possibly visited<lb/>
Madeira. This expedition, however, can not be accounted as opening<lb/>
communication between West Africa and Europe.</p>
<p>Great sailors as they were, the Berbers of North Africa made little or<lb/>
no exploration of the West African coast, confining their voyages to<lb/>
the more profitable raids in and across the Mediterranean, and, indeed,<lb/>
they regarded Cape Cantin as the end of the possible, or at least of prof-<lb/>
itable, navigation to the southward. There was, of course, caravan<lb/>
trade across the Sahara with the northern Soudan, and thus indirectly<lb/>
with the country south of it, but this was in relays, and hence was so<lb/>

indirect that it could scarcely be called communication of this section<lb/>
with European, or even North African, civilization.</p>
<p>VOYAGES OF THE &ldquo;DIEPPOIS&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer has examined with some pains and at length--wasting<lb/>
time, he thinks, for there is considerable literature on them--the claims<lb/>
for very early discoveries and settlements in West Africa by the Nor-<lb/>
mans (&ldquo;Dieppois&rdquo;), such as their alleged establishment of <hi rend="italic">Petit Dieppe</hi><lb/>
on the Grain Coast in 1364, of <hi rend="italic">Petit Paris</hi> a little later on the same coast,<lb/>
and of <hi rend="italic">La Mime</hi> (Elmina) in 1381.</p>
<p>Much curious, but the writer believes generally erroneous, information<lb/>
--in statement of fact or in deduction therefrom--is given on this sub-<lb/>
ject by Villault de Bellefond (1669), Labat (1728), Estancelin (18--),<lb/>
Vitet (1844), Gaffarel (1880), and Asseline (1874). To the writer, how-<lb/>
ever, the evidence seems absolutely unconvincing. The claims made by<lb/>
Villault de Bellefond were not put forward until after his voyage to<lb/>
Africa in 1666 and 1667. Also, a number of the allegations made by<lb/>
him, as well as by Labat, Gaffarel, and others, are quite certainly erro-<lb/>
neous; and those that are true are susceptible of another explanation,<lb/>
namely, that the French had, indeed, traded on this coast before 1666,<lb/>
but at much later dates than those alleged.</p>
<p>This whole question has been examined by Walckenaer (1842, vol.<lb/>
ii), who concludes, as does Beazley, high authority on early African<lb/>
history, that the evidence is not valid. Obviously, then, the claim<lb/>
that communication between the coast of Guinea and Europe was set<lb/>
up by the Normans in the fourteenth century is not proven; and it is,<lb/>
we believe, fallacious. The same may be said, one thinks, of the allega-<lb/>
tion of the discovery of America by the men of Dieppe not long before<lb/>
Columbus.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Certainly the Dieppois were bold and enterprising seamen,</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Among the claims of Dieppe for priority in discovery, it is alleged that a vessel<lb/>
sailing from Dieppe, in 1488, for West Africa and general discovery, reached the<lb/>
coast of Brazil at the mouth of the Amazon, returning to her home port the follow-<lb/>
ing year, and that among her crew was one Pin&ccedil;on, who was dismissed and his<lb/>
license as navigator taken away for insubordination. He, it is claimed, was the<lb/>
Vincente Ya&ntilde;es Pinzon who, with his two brothers, accompanied Columbus as<lb/>
pilots and who advised that his course be directed to the south instead of due west<lb/>
from Palos--indeed more to the south than the Admiral would agree to--looking<lb/>
for the Brazil that had already been visited.</p>
<p>Of the claims made for the Dieppois, this seems intrinsically the least improb-<lb/>
able, for the route from West Africa to Brazil was short, and with a fair wind all<lb/>
the way.</p>

<p>as their early fisheries off Newfoundland attest, but that they made <hi rend="italic">all</hi><lb/>
the maritime discoveries of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, fore-<lb/>
stalling those of Prince Henry's men, Columbus, Diaz, and da Gama,<lb/>
one is scarcely prepared to accept.</p>
<p>EARLY PORTUGUESE DISCOVERIES</p>
<p>Leaving aside all questionable claims, we have dependable historical<lb/>
evidence that about the middle of the fifteenth century communication<lb/>
between Europe and the west coast of Africa began to be opened up by<lb/>
the Portuguese under the patronage of Prince Henry the Navigator.<lb/>
In 1434 Cape Bojador was rounded by Gil Eannes; Cape Nun, well to<lb/>
the north, had been visited previously by the Catalans; in 1441 Cape<lb/>
Blanco was rounded; and in 1444-45 Dinis Diaz reached the Senegal<lb/>
river. In 1445 Cape Verde was passed, again by Diaz; and the river<lb/>
Gambia was reached the next year. Then, in 1455, began the voyages<lb/>
of Aluise Ca da Mosto, a Venetian nobleman in the service of Prince<lb/>
Henry, who discovered the Cape Verde Islands and ascended both<lb/>
the Senegal and the Gambia for considerable distances. Of these we<lb/>
have a beautiful account in Ramusio's great work, <hi rend="italic">Navigationi et<lb/>
Viaggi</hi> (Venice, 1563-83, vol. i). Finally, in 1488, Bartolom&eacute; Diaz<lb/>
passed the southern end of the continent and, turning north, reached the<lb/>
mainland--to the east of his course, at a point north of the present Port<lb/>
Elizabeth. He had passed the southern point of the continent too<lb/>
far off to see it, but sighted it on his return and called it the &ldquo;Cape of<lb/>
Storms.&rdquo; The King, however, renamed it the &ldquo;Cape of Good Hope.&rdquo;<lb/>
There is much in the point of view.</p>
<p>This was followed, in 1497-1499, by the voyage of Vasco da Gama to<lb/>
India by the same route, a crown fitting and sufficient to the great work<lb/>
begun by the Portuguese Prince a little over sixty years before, a beau-<lb/>
tiful work, well conceived and brilliantly successful.</p>
<p>DISCOVERY OF THE ISLANDS OFF THE WEST COAST</p>
<p>While communications were thus being established between Europe<lb/>
and the mainland of West Africa, the islands lying off that shore were<lb/>
discovered--or it may be, in some instances, rediscovered. The Cana-<lb/>
ries, the only group that were inhabited when discovered, were occupied<lb/>
by the Spaniards, beginning in 1402. The others were discovered by<lb/>
the Portuguese--the Madeiras in 1418; the Cape Verdes in 1456, by<lb/>
Ca da Mosto; and S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; in 1470. They were all settled in the<lb/>
fifteenth century, and European communication with them was, in gen-<lb/>
<pb n="212" id="Cb000228"/>
212<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
eral, more active than with the mainland. Also, by reason of their<lb/>
location and their relation to the slave trade, they came into early com-<lb/>
munication with America.</p>
<p>BEGINNING OF THE SLAVE TRADE</p>
<p>In his patronage of voyages of discovery Prince Henry was actuated<lb/>
mainly by a desire for geographical knowledge, and spent the bulk of his<lb/>
own fortune in these expeditions, but their cost was offset to an extent<lb/>
by the slaves brought back. The first captives from these expeditions,<lb/>
brought to Portugal by Antam Gon&ccedil;ales, came in 1441. These were<lb/>
&ldquo;Moors&rdquo; from the Sahara, Berbers by race, later called &ldquo;Azanegues&rdquo;<lb/>
the modern Tuaregs. It was soon found that one of these could be<lb/>
exchanged with his friends for several negroes (&ldquo;two Moors for ten<lb/>
Negroes&rdquo; is mentioned), each intrinsically more valuable to the Portu-<lb/>
guese than the Moor, and the Azanegues were then, when captured,<lb/>
returned and exchanged. Negroes, too, were purchased from the Azane-<lb/>
gues. Later, when the Portuguese had reached the country south of the<lb/>
Senegal, the slaves were all negroes, the great majority of them acquired<lb/>
by purchase from negro owners. This was really the beginning of the<lb/>
African slave trade as it was known in comparatively modern times.</p>
<p>About 1451 Prince Henry strictly forbade slave raids or any violence<lb/>
to the natives. He returned King Bezeghichi without ransom; and<lb/>
sent back other captives who had been brought to Lisbon, &ldquo;that thereby<lb/>
they might be less bitter against the Christians, . . . . trade with us and<lb/>
inform us of their countries.&rdquo; These orders were carried out by men<lb/>
like Ca da Mosto and Diaz, who were as much interested in geographic<lb/>
science as Prince Henry. Indeed, from the accounts of these voyages<lb/>
that have come down to us, it was only in the earlier ones that freemen<lb/>
were captured for slaves by the Portuguese. Later, the slaves seem to<lb/>
have been purchased. According to Saco (1879, p. 30), quoting Barros<lb/>
(1628), the first negroes (freemen) taken by the Portuguese in their<lb/>
own land were four captured in a canoe in the Senegal by Nu&ntilde;o Tristam<lb/>
in 1446. All previously had been bought from the Azanegues. As the<lb/>
slave raids were ordered stopped in 1451, no great number of negroes<lb/>
could have been thus taken. A large number, however, were bought--<lb/>
and for a long time--from their negro masters.</p>
<p>EARLY SETTLEMENTS ON THE MAINLAND</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Arguim</hi>. In 1448 a small fort, as a base for the slave trade, was built<lb/>
in the Bay of Arguim, just south of Cape Blanco. This was the first<lb/>
settlement on the west coast of Continental Africa made by Europeans.</p>
<pb n="213" id="Cb000229"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
213</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Elmina</hi>. The next settlement after Arguim was at S&atilde;o Jorge da<lb/>
Mina (the present Elmina) where, in 1482, Diogo d'Azambuja built a<lb/>
fort and established a permanent station. Although more of a colony<lb/>
than anything hitherto attempted, this was a permanent trading post on<lb/>
a large scale rather then a colony in the true sense, no attempt being<lb/>
made to build up a Portuguese community with permanent immigrants<lb/>
and their descendants, as was done by Europeans in the Americas.<lb/>
Still, this was the first important, permanent establishment of Euro-<lb/>
peans on the west coast, Arguim, a small fort, being intended only as a<lb/>
base of operations for the local slave trade.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Angola</hi>. In 1490 the Portuguese established themselves in Angola, in<lb/>
lower Guinea, where they built a fort and a church. This was different<lb/>
from their other stations in Africa. The king of that region accepted<lb/>
Christianity and received the Portuguese as a kind of superior friends;<lb/>
and they seem to have exercised a species of suzerainty over the Africans<lb/>
in this country and far to the southward. The African ruler sent an<lb/>
embassy to Lisbon, which compliment was returned; the sovereignty<lb/>
of the African king was recognized; protection was later extended when<lb/>
he was attacked and defeated by a tribe of cannibals, Portugal assuming<lb/>
in everything that his relation to the King was that of a feudatory to a<lb/>
suzerain.</p>
<p>Whether this properly could be called a colony by our definition may<lb/>
be a question. There was never any attempt to make a considerable<lb/>
Portuguese community from permanent immigrants and their descen-<lb/>
dants. The garrison, however, was, for this part of Africa, large, being<lb/>
mentioned at one time, although much later, as comprising 450 men;<lb/>
and it became the center of administration of a large territory in Lower<lb/>
Guinea, over which Portugal claimed suzerainty and the exclusive right<lb/>
of trade as against other Europeans. Angola, however, was primarily<lb/>
a trading post and the center of the slave trade for this region; but it<lb/>
was for a long time much the largest post on the Guinea Coast, upper<lb/>
or lower.</p>
<p>Following the Portuguese on the mainland, other European nations<lb/>
established themselves on the African Coast; first Holland and France,<lb/>
then England, Sweden, and even Brandenburg. These establishments,<lb/>
too, were trading posts, not colonies.</p>
<p>ISLAND SETTLEMENTS</p>
<p>The conquest and settlement of the Canary Islands, though not com-<lb/>
pleted until the island of Teneriffe was brought under subjection, in<lb/>

YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
1495, was begun by the Spaniards in 1402, hence this may be counted<lb/>
the earliest of the island colonies. The Madeiras were settled in 1420,<lb/>
and the Cape Verdes in 1460-61--both under license from the Portu-<lb/>
guese Crown. Settlement of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; was begun in 1485, but the<lb/>
attempt failed until Jewish <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;port&eacute;s</hi> were sent there, in 1493.</p>
<p>Unlike the mainland settlements, which remained small, those on the<lb/>
islands rapidly developed into colonies of considerable size. They be-<lb/>
came, too, ports of importance; and, especially by reason of the slave<lb/>
trade, the Cape Verdes, the Canaries, and S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; were brought<lb/>
into close and constant communication both with the west coast of<lb/>
Africa and with tropical America. We shall, therefore, have occasion<lb/>
later to discuss in more detail the history, both during settlement and<lb/>
later, of these colonies.</p>

<head>EARLY RECORDS OF SICKNESS ON THE WEST AFRICAN COAST</head>
<pb n="215" id="Cb000231"/>
<p>SICKNESS DURING DISCOVERY</p>
<p>The history of the Portuguese voyages of discovery is unusually good<lb/>
in everything relating to the geography of the West African coast and<lb/>
the ventures there, Azurara's Chronicle (1841) and those in Ramusio's<lb/>
Collection (1563-83) being models in this respect. In them, however,<lb/>
up to 1482, the occurrence of sickness is mentioned only once, and then<lb/>
incidentally. This is in Ramusio's account (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> vol. i, leaf 108) of<lb/>
the second voyage of Ca da Mosto, in 1456.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Having ascended the river<lb/>
Gambia &ldquo;for about 60 miles&rdquo; to &ldquo;the country of Battimansa,&rdquo; Ca da<lb/>
Mosto halted, sent a deputation to the chief, and received on board large<lb/>
numbers of natives. He then says &ldquo;. . . . at the end of the eleventh<lb/>
day we decided to leave and to go to the mouth of the river, because<lb/>
many of us had begun to suffer with hot (<hi rend="italic">calda</hi>) fever which is acute and<lb/>
continuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No further details are given of the sickness, and the context implies<lb/>
that, unless it had affected further progress of the venture, the sickness<lb/>
would not have been noted at all. If this were true of Ca da Mosto--<lb/>
easily the most cultivated of the servitors of Prince Henry--one would<lb/>
expect it to be accentuated in the others.</p>
<p>Sickness, then, would, or might, scarcely be noted in these voyages<lb/>
unless it seriously affected the progress of an expedition. The crews of<lb/>
the vessels engaged in discovery and making slave raids were larger<lb/>
than those on merchant vessels, which only carried enough to work the<lb/>
ship under ordinary circumstances; and thus a larger number of the first<lb/>
could be incapacitated without seriously inconveniencing the voyage.<lb/>
Still, had there been even approximately the amount of sickness which<lb/>
showed later in the expeditions of Windham, Bird and Newton, and<lb/>
others, it had seriously interfered with these expeditions and would<lb/>
have been noted. I think we must conclude, then, that there was little<lb/>
sickness of a serious nature in these early expeditions.</p>
<p>Unquestionably a factor--we believe the determining factor--for the<lb/>
difference between these and later expeditions, is that the former were</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>mainly confined to the seacoast, anchoring off shore and very rarely<lb/>
ascending rivers or going inland, while the contrary was the case with<lb/>
later expeditions, in which so much sickness occurred. Note that in the<lb/>
case quoted for Ca da Mosto the sickness occurred well up a river.</p>
<p>SICKNESS IN COMMERCIAL VOYAGES</p>
<p>As illustrating what we have just said of the more prominent mention<lb/>
of sickness in commercial voyages than in those of discovery, the only<lb/>
account we have been able to find of an early commercial voyage from<lb/>
Portugal reports much sickness, and that in a region in which none<lb/>
was noted in a military expedition made a little later.</p>
<p>After trade with the Guinea Coast was allowed by concession, a con-<lb/>
tract was given, in 1469, to Francisco Gomez, a merchant of Lisbon, to<lb/>
trade for five years with the coast south of the Cape Verde Islands, a con-<lb/>
dition being that he was to discover and explore fifty leagues of coast<lb/>
beyond Sierra Leone and, in this exploration, to look for a mine whence<lb/>
the negroes of this coast drew their gold. He fitted out an expedition<lb/>
for trading and incidental discovery under Juan Santarem and Pedro<lb/>
Escobar, both celebrated navigators of their day; and in 1471 he deter-<lb/>
mined on a place which he called <hi rend="italic">&ldquo;A Mina&rdquo;</hi> (Elmina) as the region in<lb/>
which gold was at least procurable.</p>
<p>Of this expedition, Saco (<hi rend="italic">op. cit</hi>., p. 41) quotes Andr&eacute;s Bern&aacute;ldez as<lb/>
follows: &ldquo;In the said year of 1471 the flotilla of the said King Don<lb/>
Alonzo discovered the mine of gold which today the Kings of Portugal<lb/>
possess, which is on the coast of the Ocean Sea towards the part of the<lb/>
South (<hi rend="italic">mediodia</hi>) past the coast of the black Xelofes&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">Jaloffes</hi>) &ldquo;and its<lb/>
boundaries . . . . The major part of the crews became sick and died<lb/>
without remedy and afterwards, pursuing their voyages, the travel<lb/>
became easier and they became well and ceased to die. From which<lb/>
mine of gold very great richness and honor has proceeded to the Kings of<lb/>
Portugal and each day proceeds.&rdquo; Barros (1628) also gives an account<lb/>
of this expedition of Santarem and Escobar, but says nothing of sickness.<lb/>
Possibly more sickness occurred than the Portuguese noted. Bernaldez<lb/>
was a Spaniard.</p>
<p>There are accounts of a number of English commercial voyages and<lb/>
expeditions to West Africa, and to the Gulf of Benin in particular, before<lb/>
1648--the limit of our inquiry. These were for trading purposes,<lb/>
sometimes to parts of the coast not claimed by Portugal. Abstracts of<lb/>
a large number of these voyages are given by Walckenaer (1842) in his<lb/>
monumental work, but the writer has been at pains to look up the origi-<lb/>
<pb n="217" id="Cb000233"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
217<lb/>
nal accounts from which Walckenaer's abstracts were taken, in Hakluyt<lb/>
(1885-90), Richard Eden (1577), &ldquo;Purchas his Pilgrims&rdquo;" (1625), Awn-<lb/>
sham and John Churchill (1732), Pinkerton (1808-14), the Abb&eacute;<lb/>
Pr&eacute;vost (1747-80), James Stanier Clarke (1803), and others.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Hakluyt,<lb/>
Eden, and Purchas made a custom of interviewing returning sea-captains,<lb/>
examining their logs, and getting accounts of their ventures by word of<lb/>
mouth. Their accounts are exact as to dates and locations--matters of<lb/>
special interest to us.</p>
<p>In practically all of these expeditions sickness is noted, and in some,<lb/>
indeed, the mortalities are excessive. For instance, in the expedition of<lb/>
Windham and Pinteado to Benin, in 1553, &ldquo;scarcely forty&rdquo; out of 140<lb/>
men returned to Plymouth; and nearly all the deaths occurred within<lb/>
little more than a month, aboard ship lying at the mouth of the Benin<lb/>
River, dying &ldquo;sometimes three and sometimes 4 or 5 in a day&rdquo; (Hakluyt,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">op. cit</hi>., vol. xi, pp. 80-81). The loss in Bird and Newton's expedition, also<lb/>
to Benin, in 1588, was proportionally as great, and in as short a time. It<lb/>
is worth noting that the ships of Windham and Pinteado lay in the Benin<lb/>
River, near the mouth, while a party went up the river &ldquo;50 or 60 leagues&rdquo;<lb/>
to &ldquo;the king of Benin his court&rdquo; to get their cargo (cardamons). All<lb/>
the sickness recorded was in the men who stayed with the ships. With<lb/>
Bird and Newton, the same procedure was followed for trading, but the<lb/>
only sickness recorded was in the land party.</p>
<p>Such community mortality as these expeditions suffered, and in such<lb/>
a short time--hence not caused by recurrent attacks--is indeed extremely<lb/>
high for malaria, even in West Africa, and it may well be that it, or<lb/>
much of it, was from yellow fever. This, however, is the only evidence<lb/>
therefor, and one hesitates to so pronounce it.</p>
<p>In the third voyage of Towerson to Guinea,<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> a suspicious circumstance</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> For the voyages of Windham and Pinteado, Towerson, John Lok, and Bird and<lb/>

voyages were made in 1555-56 and 1556-57, respectively. In the first, only one<lb/>
death is mentioned (Hakluyt, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, vol. xi, p. 130); in the second, three deaths,<lb/>
on the homeward voyage, are mentioned, and some other sickness is implied (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.,<lb/>

<p>is that a considerable outbreak of sickness and a number of deaths oc-<lb/>
curred on one of his vessels on which he had received some sick French-<lb/>
men from a vessel that had been long on the coast. However, while<lb/>
these are the first deaths recorded, there had been some sickness on<lb/>
Towerson's ship a month earlier, and the country they were in was un-<lb/>
questionably malarious, and at places intensely so.</p>
<p>John Lok, who led an expedition to Guinea in 1554-55 (Hakluyt, <hi rend="italic">op.<lb/>
cit.</hi>, vol. xi, pp. 84-102), mentions the death of &ldquo;about twentie and<lb/>
foure&rdquo; of his men, &ldquo;whereof many died at their returne into the clime of<lb/>
the colde regions, as betweene the Islands of Azores and England.&rdquo;<lb/>
Bird and Newton, too, (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 320) leaving Benin April 13 with sick<lb/>
on board, came to the Azores July 25, &ldquo;where our men beganne a fresh<lb/>
to grow ill, and divers died . . . . and as many as remained liuing were in<lb/>
a hard case.&rdquo; This occurrence of sickness on the high seas might have<lb/>
been in men infected after sailing--hence yellow fever. It might, how-<lb/>
ever, as well have been a recrudescence of malaria from striking colder<lb/>
weather. The latter especially seems to have been the case with Bird<lb/>
and Newton, as one gets the impression of few fatalities, but much debil-<lb/>
ity in the crew from this time on, for it is said that unless they had gotten<lb/>
&ldquo;sixe fresh men&rdquo; from an English ship &ldquo;on this side the North Cape,&rdquo;<lb/>
they would have had difficulty in reaching England.</p>
<p>From reasons given before, namely, the malignity of the malaria in<lb/>
West Africa, the small number of Europeans exposed to it in these vessels,<lb/>
and the imperfection of their records (the dates can be relied on--they<lb/>
are from the ships' logs), the difficulty of determining the presence of<lb/>
yellow fever, if it existed in company with malaria, would be extreme.<lb/>
However suggestive they may be, we do not think the data are suffi-<lb/>
cient, in any of these accounts, clearly, or even very strongly, to indicate<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud, indeed (1890, p. 27), accepts the sickness and mortal-<lb/>
ity recorded in several of these expeditions as probably yellow fever,<lb/>
but there is no evidence for this save an excessive mortality among<lb/>
Europeans in a region physically and sociologically well suited for the<lb/>
endemicity of yellow fever and in which we are reasonably sure <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des<lb/>
aegypti</hi> abounded. It would be much easier for the writer to follow the<lb/>
lead of this erudite Frenchman here, but he has set himself to examine<lb/>
the original sources and to use the same bases of criticism for Africa as<lb/>
he did for America.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud, while accepting these as possible instances of yellow fever,<lb/>
does not consider that the disease was indigenous in Africa. He thinks it had<lb/>
been, by this time, imported from America.</p>

<p>SICKNESS IN EARLY SETTLEMENTS</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Arguim</hi>. There is no account of any sickness at Arguim during the<lb/>
establishment of this post or subsequently. Indeed, except the date, and<lb/>
the purpose for which the fort here was built, there is practically no<lb/>
history for Arguim at all.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">S&atilde;o Jorge da Mina</hi> (Elmina). This was settled by Diogo d'Azam-<lb/>
buja, sailing from Lisbon the &ldquo;Eve of St. Lucia's Day,&rdquo; December 12,<lb/>
1481, with 500 soldiers, 100 carpenters and masons, and materials for<lb/>
building. The fort was rapidly completed for a garrison of 60 men,<lb/>
which was judged sufficient, and Azambuja himself remained there for<lb/>
two and a half years, by which time the post was prosperous commer-<lb/>
cially (Cordeiro, 1892). The records of this expedition and settlement<lb/>
are given at length by Barros (1628), who devotes over four pages to a<lb/>
verbatim speech of King Caramancas, expressing his gratitude to the<lb/>
Portuguese for bringing him Christianity and promising him the protec-<lb/>
tion of the Portuguese monarch, but among them we find no record of<lb/>
sickness on which we can rely. A modern chronicler (Cordeiro, 1892,<lb/>
p. 32), indeed, writes: &ldquo;but the climate began to exercise its deleterious<lb/>
action on that numerous colony, badly disposed to resist it.&rdquo; Yet in his<lb/>
published reference (naturally the unpublished manuscripts to which he<lb/>
refers are not available to us) by a contemporary historian (Resende), no<lb/>
account of any sickness is given.</p>
<p>There was, however, as we have said, much sickness and heavy mortal-<lb/>
ity in the expedition of Santarem and Escobar, which first visited this<lb/>
place in 1471. One is inclined to think that sickness sometimes escaped<lb/>
notice in the Portuguese record of settlements.</p>
<p>Subsequent to its settlement, we find practically no history of this<lb/>
place until it was captured by the Dutch in 1637, a previous attack, in<lb/>
1625, having failed.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Angola</hi>. Of the establishments of the Portuguese in Angola, the<lb/>
history is practically all of diplomacy and politics, no colonists going in<lb/>
at first, only the Portuguese diplomatic and commercial agents; the<lb/>
former with necessary escorts. Save that, although unhealthful to<lb/>
Europeans, it was less so than S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, we have no detail of its<lb/>
healthfulness or the reverse in very early times. From the experience<lb/>
of the Dutch, who captured Angola in 1640, it must have been in that<lb/>
interval unhealthful, but not continuously or severely so, as were the<lb/>
island colonies of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; and S&atilde;o Thiago.</p>

history of any sickness during the settlement, and they have always en-<lb/>
joyed the reputation of being extremely healthful, with an ideal climate.<lb/>
One outbreak only of yellow fever has been reported there, in 1738<lb/>
(Guyon, 1858, quoting Rodriguez de Avreu).</p>
<p>There is no account of sickness during the settlement of the Cape<lb/>
Verde Islands; and of such as occurred in the Canaries and at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;,<lb/>
accounts will be given in the chapters dealing more fully with these<lb/>
colonies.</p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>As regards historical records giving definitive evidence of the presence<lb/>
of yellow fever, the history of the mainland of West Africa during dis-<lb/>
covery and settlement--and indeed for many years thereafter--is<lb/>
negative. Yet it should be noted that the negative record is not of the<lb/>
same weight here as in the New World. There we found, in the period<lb/>
of settlement, conditions such that, had yellow fever existed, it would<lb/>
have manifested itself in such way as probably to be recognizable in the<lb/>
records that we have. Moreover, we have, in the epidemic of 1648 in<lb/>
Yucatan, proof that an area well suited for maintenance of the infection<lb/>
must have been previously free from it--at least for a very long time.</p>
<p>In Africa, on the contrary, we have found no conditions under which<lb/>
yellow fever, if present, would have been certainly recognizable in our<lb/>
histories. The records themselves are not so full as for America, and the<lb/>
conditions are such that yellow fever, if it did occur, is not to be dis-<lb/>
tinguished from the ever-present and severe malaria. Thus, we find, in<lb/>
not a few places, accounts of what <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have been yellow fever in Africa,<lb/>
but the circumstances do not permit certain identification.</p>
<p>A further study of the island colonies may be more fruitful, for unlike<lb/>
the settlements on the mainland, which were small military or trading<lb/>
posts, those on certain of the islands were true colonies, with fairly large<lb/>
numbers of European immigrants. It is true that the islands, except<lb/>
the Canaries, were uninhabited when discovered, and hence do not come<lb/>
into question as places of origin of yellow fever if we believe that this is<lb/>
an infection peculiar to man. However, once settled, the colonies of<lb/>
S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, the Cape Verdes, and the Canaries become of importance<lb/>
as places in which to seek early evidence of yellow fever. <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des aegypti</hi>,<lb/>
if not indigenous, must have been introduced early; and the same traffic<lb/>
that brought them would, sooner or later, introduce the infection of<lb/>
yellow fever if it existed on the mainland.</p>
<pb n="221" id="Cb000237"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
221</p>
<p>The effect upon the colonists themselves might not be discoverable in<lb/>
such scant records as we have, for, after the first settlements, immigrants<lb/>
came in small numbers at a time; and if infection were frequently intro-<lb/>
duced it might readily happen that even with a high prevalence of yellow<lb/>
fever no <hi rend="italic">epidemics</hi> would occur sufficiently extensive to be definitive.<lb/>
There would be more likelihood of discovering the infection by its devel-<lb/>
opment on board ships visiting the islands, especially in the larger naval<lb/>
expeditions. It is to the latter, then, that we shall direct our particular<lb/>
attention.</p>

<head>THE ISLAND OF S&Atilde;O THOM&Eacute;</head>
<pb n="222" id="Cb000238"/>
<p>SICKNESS DURING SETTLEMENT</p>
<p>S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; (St. Thomas), a little island some 400 square miles in area,<lb/>
lies on the Equator, less than 200 miles from the mainland of Africa.<lb/>
Uninhabited when discovered, in 1470, it was settled by the King of<lb/>
Portugal. The account that is given of this by a number of writers<lb/>
(Dapper, 1676; Barbot, 1732; Labat, 1731; and Faria e Sousa, 1730--<lb/>
the last being by far the best account) is that at the first attempt to<lb/>
settle it, by Jo&atilde;o de Payva, in 1485, the settlers all died, or so many died<lb/>
that the attempt to settle it with volunteer immigrants was abandoned<lb/>
and, in 1493, <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;port&eacute;s</hi> were resorted to. These were mainly the children<lb/>
of Jews who had reverted from their forced conversions. So many<lb/>
died, however, of those who went directly to S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, that later the<lb/>
immigrants were first settled on the mainland of Angola. A certain<lb/>
number died here, for the place was not healthful for whites, but far<lb/>
fewer than if they had gone directly to S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, and when these<lb/>
people moved from Angola to the island, they lived there in safety.</p>
<p>This account of the early settlement of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; is concurred in by<lb/>
so many writers that it should either be true or else--as may have<lb/>
happened--all followed the same tradition. It is analogous to the<lb/>
method used by the coffee factors at Maracaibo prior to 1914 for their<lb/>
European personnel. The clerks newly arrived from Europe were sent<lb/>
at once to C&uacute;cuta, where they were subject to a &ldquo;fever of acclimation&rdquo;<lb/>
of only moderate severity. Moving, then, to Maracaibo, they were<lb/>
safe from the yellow fever prevailing there, which otherwise was fre-<lb/>
quently fatal.</p>
<p>It would be, however, an unwarrantable assumption to make the same<lb/>
explanation for the two cases. The accounts quoted witness less that a<lb/>
residence at Angola did protect from the sicknesses at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; than<lb/>
that it was the belief of our chroniclers that it would do so. And even<lb/>
if this belief were true, it does not necessarily imply a <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> immuniza-<lb/>
tion against disease by residence in Angola. It may have been that<lb/>
becoming gradually accustomed to hard and unsanitary conditions of<lb/>
life was less dangerous to these immigrants than to be exposed to them<lb/>
222<lb/>
<pb n="223" id="Cb000239"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
223<lb/>
suddenly. There is an acclimation to living conditions as well as a<lb/>
special acclimation against disease.</p>
<p>These accounts, however, do show the belief that protection from the<lb/>
severe sicknesses of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; was given by residence in the less un-<lb/>
healthful climate of Angola, as the similar belief was later current in<lb/>
Maracaibo which, in the latter case, meant the existence of yellow fever<lb/>
in both C&uacute;cuta and Maracaibo.</p>
<p>GROWTH OF THE COLONY</p>
<p>The reputation of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; for unhealthfulness and a peculiarly ob-<lb/>
noxious climate continued long after its settlement, but did not prevent<lb/>
its development into a prosperous colony. The earliest contemporary<lb/>
account that we have of it, after its settlement, is that by an unnamed<lb/>
&ldquo;Portuguese Pilot,&rdquo; addressed to Count Ramon della Torre of Verona,<lb/>
but written, it is said, at the special request of the celebrated physician,<lb/>
Fracastorius. It is translated and published by Ramusio in his <hi rend="italic">Navi-<lb/>
gationi et Viaggi</hi> (1563-83, vol. i), and is given as a nearly complete<lb/>
translation from Ramusio by Walckenaer (1842, vol. i, pp. 376-401).</p>
<p>The writer states that he had made five voyages to S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, the<lb/>
first in 1520. There is no direct statement as to when the document was<lb/>
written, but there is internal evidence of a date about 1535 to 1540.<lb/>
The account is that of a close, intelligent observer, and shows no little<lb/>
native ability in the writer, although he apologizes for being &ldquo;only a man<lb/>
of the sea and not accustomed to the use of a pen&rdquo;. It is a long docu-<lb/>
ment, mainly given, naturally, to maritime conditions, sailing directions,<lb/>
and customs and products of the country, which were new to Europeans,<lb/>
but it contains a surprising amount and variety of information about the<lb/>
island.</p>
<p>The principal product, he says, is sugar. Although only one-third<lb/>
of the island had been cleared, production was already on a large scale--<lb/>
he mentions about sixty sugar-mills using water-power and others using<lb/>
horse- or man-power--and, for its cultivation, negro slaves had been<lb/>
imported in large numbers, some colonists owning as many as two or<lb/>
three hundred. The city of Pavaosan (Pavoasan), now St. Thomas,<lb/>
comprised &ldquo;six or seven hundred families.&rdquo; One judges this is exclusive<lb/>
of slaves, though it doubtless included mulattoes and possibly negro<lb/>
freemen, some of whom are mentioned as being rich and intelligent.<lb/>
Even with a liberal allowance for slaves and for whites outside of the<lb/>
city, this is still a small population for the maintenance of yellow fever.<lb/>
The account implies, however, that the colony was growing, inducements<lb/>
<pb n="224" id="Cb000240"/>

YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
being offered for the occupation of uncultivated land. Moreover, the<lb/>
shipping seems to have been active, so that there must have been con-<lb/>
siderable immigration of transients in ships' crews, and of permanent<lb/>
settlers.</p>
<p>SICKNESS PREVALENT AFTER SETTLEMENT</p>
<p>Of the sickness usually prevalent in the colony after its establishment,<lb/>
we have accounts from four observers who visited the island between<lb/>
1520 and 1725.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">The Portuguese Pilot</hi>.rdquo; The earliest record is that of our Pilot.<lb/>
Concerning the health of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; he says: &ldquo;In the windy months,&rdquo;<lb/>
May, June, July, and August, &ldquo;the negroes, unless protected from cold,<lb/>
get sick and die. For Europeans these are the most healthful. In the<lb/>
hot months, December, January, and February . . . the negroes are well<lb/>
and gay . . . the whites are feeble and prostrated. Without having fever<lb/>
positively they feel a fatigue and a general malaise; and can hardly drag<lb/>
themselves along. . . using a cane to walk . . . lose appetite and are always<lb/>
thirsty. . . . . All dine together . . . . as a change of food from one house-<lb/>
hold to another tempts the appetite. It is too hot to go out and attend<lb/>
to business. . . . . The white inhabitants of Pavaosan . . . . have an<lb/>
attack (<hi rend="italic">parosismo</hi>) of fever about every eight to ten days, . . . . lasting<lb/>
only for two hours or a little more . . . . and to prevent this are careful to<lb/>
be bled three or four times per annum. When the fever takes the newly<lb/>
arrived it is nearly always fatal. This fever for them differs and lasts 20<lb/>
days and one bleeds the patient up to eleven times and draws from<lb/>
him at each time an entire bowl of blood; . . . . The 7th and the 14th days<lb/>
of illness are critical, and if the patient passes these well there is hope for<lb/>
his recovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no record that this island has ever been afflicted with a<lb/>
&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">pestilentia</hi>,&rdquo; as has happened to the Cape de Verdes, where it raged one<lb/>
time, it is said, with an extreme violence . . . . but the whites are subject<lb/>
to these ardent fevers and to dysentery. . . . . Few pass fifty years, while<lb/>
the negroes,&rdquo; thin and healthy, &ldquo;live to one hundred and ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, he describes smallpox and syphilis, calling the latter<lb/>
(doubtless with Fracastorius' full approval!) &ldquo;the French disease.&rdquo;<lb/>
He gives, indeed, a very bad account of the excessive heat, moisture,<lb/>
and fogs, and of the illness which they engendered among the white<lb/>
inhabitants.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Dapper</hi>. The next--though much later--account is by Olfert Dapper,<lb/>
a Fleming, a great traveller in Africa, who visited S&atilde;o Thorn&eacute; apparently<lb/>
<pb n="225" id="Cb000241"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
225<lb/>
between 1640 and 1664, and published an account of his travels in<lb/>
Flemish in 1676. He gives a very full account of the island, and I think<lb/>
he had read the Pilot's account in Ramusio.</p>
<p>He says: (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> pp. 68-76) &ldquo;The hot, intemperate, humid air is<lb/>
harmful, especially to Europeans, who rarely reach 50 years or show<lb/>
white beards. The natives are often over 100.&rdquo; He adds that young<lb/>
white people cease to grow after they arrive at St. Thomas. He blames<lb/>
this unhealthfulness on the great heat &ldquo;joined to the vaporous humidity.<lb/>
This is not the same everywhere over the island, but principally over the<lb/>
city&rdquo; (Pavoasan) &ldquo;it reigns mixed with some kind of a malignity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maladies which reign principally are hot and malignant fevers,<lb/>
of which the whites, and above all strangers, feel this attack in a few<lb/>
days, because, although one stops as little as may be in this city to so-<lb/>
journ, yet they feel themselves so suddenly and violently attacked with<lb/>
an ardent fever that very often it carries them off the 4th or the 7th or,<lb/>
at the least, the 14th day. If they pass those days they generally get<lb/>
well, unless they commit some excess of drinking or eating, for the best<lb/>
remedy is to observe a good regimen of living and to eat little and to fast<lb/>
much in order to be able to pass the 14th day. Nevertheless it is neces-<lb/>
sary to bleed often and to purge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mentions, both in S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; and in Angola, on the mainland, a<lb/>
sickness, the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Bitios de Ku</hi>&rdquo; as &ldquo;very common and very dangerous,&rdquo;<lb/>
&ldquo;a species of dysentery, presaged by an extraordinary melancholy and<lb/>
accompanied with a great pain in the head; with lassitude and with pain<lb/>
in the eyes.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Barbot</hi>. Jean Barbot, &ldquo;Agent General of the Royal Company of<lb/>
Africa and the Islands of America&rdquo; (French) who was long resident on<lb/>
this Coast, gives a detailed description of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, published in<lb/>
Churchill's <hi rend="italic">Collection of Voyages and Travels</hi> (1732, vol. v). It was<lb/>
written, apparently, soon after 1682.</p>
<p>He speaks of the hot and humid climate, &ldquo;pernicious to <hi rend="italic">Europeans</hi>,<lb/>
who can scarce live there to fifty years of age,&rdquo; although the natives are<lb/>
healthy and many of them &ldquo;attain to an hundred years of age.&rdquo; He<lb/>
makes the same complaint as his predecessor of the &ldquo;thick, stinking fogs&rdquo;<lb/>
and of their unwholesomeness, such that even &ldquo;the natives are forced to<lb/>
keep close at home for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the distempers, he mentions fevers, smallpox, &ldquo;cholicks,&rdquo; the<lb/>
bloody-flux, the venereal disease; and another called there &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Bichos no<lb/>
Cu</hi>,&rdquo; besides several others, particularly &ldquo;head-ache.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> For an account of the origin of the name &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">o bicho</hi>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">a bicha</hi>&rdquo; among the<lb/>
Portuguese, see page 195, footnote 6.</p>
<pb n="226" id="Cb000242"/>
<p>226<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fever, above all other distempers, destroys the greatest number of<lb/>
people, especially new-comers from <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi>, carrying them off in less<lb/>
than eight days sickness. The first symptoms of it are a cold shivering,<lb/>
attended with an intolerable heat or inflammation in the body for two<lb/>
hours, so as to throw the patient into a violent delirium, which at the<lb/>
fifth or the seventh fit, or the fourteenth at most, makes an end of most<lb/>
persons seized with it; the fit returning every other day. If the patient<lb/>
escapes, he may reasonably expect to live there several years in health,<lb/>
provided he is temperate . . . . well dieted after having been purged . . . .<lb/>
with <hi rend="italic">Cassia</hi> infused in the blood of vipers. They allow the patient to<lb/>
drink water plentifully during the fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cholicks are there so terrible, as to distract the patient in three<lb/>
or four days.&rdquo; They are ascribed to the evening dews, cooling off while<lb/>
sweating, as in the breeze at night, or drinking cocoanut milk, etc.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;This sort of cholick has swept away an incredible number of<lb/>
people. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The . . . . <hi rend="italic">Bichos no Cu</hi> is also very common there, both among <hi rend="italic">Whites</hi><lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">Blacks</hi>, the nature of it is to melt or dissolve men's fat inwardly, and<lb/>
to void it by stool. . . . . The <hi rend="italic">French</hi> call this distemper &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Gras fondu</hi>,&rsquo; that<lb/>
is, melted grease.&rdquo;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Labat</hi>. Finally, P&egrave;re Labat, in his <hi rend="italic">Voyage du Chevalier Des Marchais</hi><lb/>
. . . (1731, tom, iii, chap, i) tells of conditions at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; at the time of<lb/>
his visit (1725). Although this account is written after the time limit<lb/>
(1648) we had set, its description of the prevalent diseases is valuable<lb/>
because of Labat's intelligence and his familiarity with yellow fever.<lb/>
He it was who reported the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>&rdquo; introduced into the Antilles<lb/>
by the <hi rend="italic">Oriflamme</hi> in 1690. He observed it closely at that time--as a<lb/>
priest he had much occasion to see it--and had a severe attack himself.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi></p>
<p>He gives practically the same account of the sicknesses as did the<lb/>
&ldquo;Portuguese Pilot&rdquo; and the other two we have quoted. Indeed, his<lb/>
pathological data are so closely in accordance with the others that one<lb/>
feels quite certain that he must have read Ramusio at any rate, which,<lb/>
indeed, was probable, as he was a learned man, familiar with Italian,<lb/>
and was of great industry.</p>
<p>His description of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bitios</hi>&rdquo; is, however, somewhat more explicit<lb/>
than Dapper's or Barbot's. He says (vol. iii, pp. 5-6):</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> These last three factors are alleged by all our writers as causal. Stanley<lb/>
(1885), too, lays considerable stress on the cooling off as a cause of fever in Africa.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> He states that he had two attacks in Martinique. The first, from his descrip-<lb/>
tion, must have been yellow fever. From the same data it is hard to say what the<lb/>
second was.</p>
<pb n="227" id="Cb000243"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
227</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second sickness is called in Portuguese &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Bitios de Cu</hi>.&rsquo; It is an<lb/>
ulcer which comes in the lower bowel which gives very acute pains with<lb/>
fever &amp; transport to the brain&rdquo; (delirium). &ldquo;This sickness carries away<lb/>
in three or four days those who are attacked of it &amp; corrupts so quickly<lb/>
the blood &amp; the flesh of all the bodies that they fall into rotting before<lb/>
the sick man gives up his spirit. It has been believed for a long time<lb/>
that it comes from a total dissolution of the mass of the blood and an<lb/>
entire coagulation of it. . . . . It has been in Brazil for many years. It<lb/>
has passed from Brazil to the islands of America &amp; from there to the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">tierra firme</hi>. It has been called, in the French islands, the &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Mal de<lb/>
Siam</hi>,&rsquo; because it was brought by a vessel of the King . . . . the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Oriflamme</hi>, which, returning from Siam after our defeat in that country,<lb/>
had been obliged to refresh in that country&rdquo; (Brazil) &ldquo;where it took<lb/>
aboard this plague (<hi rend="italic">mauvais drogue</hi>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is enthusiastic for and stresses the treatment previously mentioned<lb/>
by Dapper and Barbot--forced lavements of a decoction of cassia and<lb/>
lemon juice, followed by suppositories of pieces of lemon--which, he says,<lb/>
&ldquo;cures the sick man in a few minutes,&rdquo; relying, one judges, rather on<lb/>
Portuguese reports than his own observation.</p>
<p>INDICATIONS OF YELLOW FEVER ON THE ISLAND</p>
<p>The diseases prevailing at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, mentioned in the records which<lb/>
we have quoted, were dysentery or &ldquo;bloody-flux,&rdquo; fevers, and &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bitios de<lb/>
cu</hi>&rdquo;--whatever that might be or include. Of these, dysentery need not<lb/>
be discussed; it was too well known to the Europeans of that time.<lb/>
However, if yellow fever were present at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, it could have been<lb/>
included either among the &ldquo;fevers,&rdquo; or--considering the very varied<lb/>
symptomatology given--in the blanket diagnosis of the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bitios</hi>.&rdquo; The<lb/>
first epidemic of yellow fever introduced into Brazil (1686) was known<lb/>
under a similar designation, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">epidemia da bicha</hi>,&rdquo; by the Portuguese.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Fevers</hi>. Malarial fever was unquestionably prevalent, and likely the<lb/>
most generally prevalent. It is so clearly indicated in the descriptions,<lb/>
from that of the &ldquo;Portuguese Pilot&rdquo; on, that there is no need of discuss-<lb/>
ing this question. There are a few points, however, which may imply<lb/>
the co-existence of other fevers therewith. As possibly indicating yellow<lb/>
fever we have:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) The statement that the fogs exercised a &ldquo;special malignancy&rdquo;<lb/>
in the fevers they produced in the city as compared with the country.<lb/>
This is more like yellow fever than malaria, which is essentially a rural<lb/>
disease.</item>
<item>(2) The statement that if one recovered from an attack of the severe<lb/>
<pb n="228" id="Cb000244"/>
228<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
fever he was apt to go &ldquo;several years&rdquo; without another attack. This<lb/>
implies a belief that there was a severe fever, one attack of which gave<lb/>
an immunity against recurrence, and may be taken with the analogous<lb/>
belief concerning the fevers in Angola and S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; at the settlement<lb/>
of the latter.</item></list>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Bitios de Cu</hi>.&rdquo; It is difficult to judge what this represents. Al-<lb/>
though our reporters seem explicitly to differentiate it from dysentery, one<lb/>
judges quite a number of cases of the latter were included under this<lb/>
designation. Sigaud's (1844) description of the disease later called<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bicho</hi>&rdquo; in Brazil strongly suggests <hi rend="italic">schistosomiasis mansoni</hi>, and the<lb/>
therapy which he mentions is similar to that described for the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bitios</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
in S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;. It is quite possible, then, that our &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bitios</hi>&rdquo; here includes<lb/>
schistosoma dysentery. However, some parts of the descriptions of<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bitios de cu</hi>&rdquo; suggest yellow fever, namely:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) The acuteness ascribed to it; the high fever, weakness, pain in the<lb/>
head and eyes--the latter especially characteristic of yellow fever and<lb/>
dengue--are by no means characteristic of <hi rend="italic">schistosomiasis mansoni</hi> or of<lb/>
dysentery. They are characteristic of yellow fever.</item>
<item>(2) The violent abdominal pains ascribed to the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bitios</hi>&rdquo; one might<lb/>
naturally consider as identifying it with dysentery--bacillary or amoebic,<lb/>
or from <hi rend="italic">schistosomiasis</hi>. They might as well, however, be the excruciat-<lb/>
ing epigastric pains accompanying the retching hiccough which precedes<lb/>
black vomit in yellow fever. &ldquo;Cramps of the belly--very painful,&rdquo;<lb/>
is noted by many of the older writers as characteristic of yellow fever.<lb/>
Certainly, death within four days would not occur with <hi rend="italic">schistosomiasis</hi><lb/>
and would happen in yellow fever. Nor is the wild delirium, which is so<lb/>
stressed in our descriptions of the &ldquo;bitios,&rdquo; a symptom of either <hi rend="italic">schistoso-<lb/>
miasis</hi> or dysentery, while it is markedly so of yellow fever.</item>
<item>(3) Labat's account stresses these characteristics and adds another,<lb/>
on which he lays stress, namely, the decomposition of the body before<lb/>
death. While this does not occur in yellow fever, it is worth noting that<lb/>
Labat had <hi rend="italic">stated that the same occurred</hi> in the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>&rdquo; in Marti-<lb/>
nique, and that Schotte (1782, p. 131), in his account of the yellow<lb/>
fever in Senegal in 1778, states: &ldquo;. . . . the inflammation of the liver, of<lb/>
the stomach, and perhaps of the intestines, was changed into a gangrene,<lb/>
and this was followed by an incipient putrefaction of the whole body, and<lb/>
death.&rdquo; One judges that in both cases what was referred to was the<lb/>
large livid infarcts and ecchymoses that show in bad cases of yellow<lb/>
fever, the skin over which sometimes sloughs. Scurvy shows the same<lb/>
appearances, and the older writers characterize it, too, as showing<lb/>
&ldquo;decomposition&rdquo; before death.<lb/>
<pb n="229" id="Cb000245"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
229</item>
<item>(4) Labat thought he recognized this &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bitios</hi>&rdquo; as the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>&rdquo;<lb/>
that he had seen in America--which <hi rend="italic">was</hi> yellow fever. Or, to put it<lb/>
more accurately, he recognized <hi rend="italic">some</hi> cases of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>&rdquo; among the<lb/>
sicknesses designated as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bitios</hi>&rdquo; at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;. Certainly, we need not<lb/>
give too much weight to this identification, yet Labat had had much<lb/>
and prolonged experience in yellow fever, and one is apt to note very<lb/>
closely a disease from which he himself has suffered; and it may well be<lb/>
that he did see cases of yellow fever in S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; and recognized it by<lb/>
the appearance of the dead and dying, for as a priest he would be<lb/>
especially associated with these.</item></list>
</p>
<p>It was natural enough that there should be no close differentiation of<lb/>
diseases, but that under one nomenclature should be confused severe<lb/>
cases of any malignant fever, along with <hi rend="italic">schistosomiasis</hi> or other dysen-<lb/>
tery. The &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bitios</hi>,&rdquo; then, while very probably including some severe<lb/>
cases of bacillary dysentery and possibly some of <hi rend="italic">schistosomiasis</hi>, may<lb/>
well have included yellow fever also, just as the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">fi&egrave;vre bilieuse inflam-<lb/>
matoire</hi>&rdquo; of the French Antilles included other things along with yellow<lb/>
fever.</p>
<p>One can not say that anything in the accounts we have quoted estab-<lb/>
lishes the existence of yellow fever here. The most that can be said is<lb/>
that, if yellow fever were present, we should expect the accounts to have<lb/>
been much as they are.</p>
<p>SICKNESS IN THE DUTCH FLEETS, 1599 AND 1641</p>
<p>During the years that we have covered, S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; was twice cap-<lb/>
tured by the Dutch: first, in 1599, by Admiral Van der Does, and again,<lb/>
in 1641, by Admiral Jol; and both times the invaders suffered extremely<lb/>
heavy losses from sickness. These epidemics are mentioned and, to an<lb/>
extent, described by Dapper, Barbot, and Labat in the accounts from<lb/>
which we have quoted. As they wrote from information which must<lb/>
have come to them at second or third hand, presumably from Portuguese<lb/>
sources, and apparently at least in part from tradition, their reports of<lb/>
the sickness among the Dutch can not be considered very reliable as to<lb/>
symptoms and mortality. Still, they serve at least to confirm the repu-<lb/>
tation of the island for unhealthfulness.</p>
<p>Of Jol's expedition, Dapper says: &ldquo;The Dutch had no little number of<lb/>
deaths and of sick men when they made themselves masters of the island<lb/>
in 1641 under Admiral Jol, for there hardly remained 10 or 12 men<lb/>
sound of each Company, and Jol himself died, besides several other chiefs.<lb/>
Finally the malady raged with so much fury and it extended itself so<lb/>
among his men that there hardly remained enough for sentinels, and so<lb/>
<pb n="230" id="Cb000246"/>
230<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
few sailors that there was difficulty in equipping two vessels,&rdquo; which he<lb/>
sent to Count Maurice in Brazil for help. &ldquo;The most part died of<lb/>
pain in the head so violent that it threw them into madness and folly.<lb/>
Some had a pain in the belly which carried them off in 3 or 4 days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barbot, speaking of &ldquo;this sort of cholick&rdquo; that &ldquo;has swept away an<lb/> 
incredible number of men,&rdquo; says: . . . . &ldquo;It . . . . with the bloody flux,<lb/>
kill'd such a number of <hi rend="italic">Dutch</hi> men the two several times they subdued<lb/>
the island, in the years 1610 (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) and 1641, as before mentioned; that<lb/>
the island was then known in <hi rend="italic">Holland</hi> by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Dutch Church-<lb/>
yard</hi>.&rdquo; His account adds nothing of importance, and need not be<lb/>
quoted further.</p>
<p>P&egrave;re Labat's account is again similar--indeed suspiciously so--to<lb/>
those of his predecessors: &ldquo;Admiral Yol was master of the fort and the<lb/>
city and of all the flat country, but the sickness carried him away also<lb/>
and with him nearly all the chiefs of his troops and of his fleet and such<lb/>
a great number of soldiers and sailors that there remained scarcely<lb/>
enough to stand sentry and to furnish sailors for two ships, which made<lb/>
them abandon or burn the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most part died of an ardent, putrid fever, accompanied with a<lb/>
headache so violent that they became foolish and as insane. Some<lb/>
others were tormented with pains in the bowels so excessive that the<lb/>
strongest could hardly bear them to the 4th day. Since this time the<lb/>
Hollanders have lost the desire to go to be buried in such a dangerous<lb/>
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As regards mortality, these accounts are confirmed from various other<lb/>
sources. Thus, Netscher (1853, p. 121), writing from Dutch sources,<lb/>
says that of the Dutch garrison of 600 men placed on the island in Octo-<lb/>
ber, 1641, only 230 remained in December, and he also records the death<lb/>
of Jol and many other high officers. The mortality here is high enough<lb/>
for the disease to have been yellow fever; and the symptomatologies that<lb/>
we have quoted--scant and traditional--are not inconsistent with that<lb/>
diagnosis. However, the circumstances do not permit exclusion of<lb/>
other diseases or other places as sources of the infections, for before<lb/>
attacking S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; the fleet had taken S. Paulo de Loanda and had<lb/>
been on the African coast some two months.</p>
<p>Intermingled with the accounts which Dapper, Barbot, and Labat give<lb/>
of the sickness in Jol's forces are allusions to the epidemic in Van der<lb/>
Does' fleet in 1599, but as to this their data are less definite. Since Van<lb/>
der Does came to S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; from the Canaries, the history of his expe-<lb/>
dition and the sickness therein may be given better in a later chapter<lb/>
dealing with those islands and supplementing the records that we have<lb/>
from S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; with data from other sources.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII</head>
<head>THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS</head>
<pb n="231" id="Cb000247"/>
<p>The Cape Verde Islands, discovered by Ca da Mosto in 1456, were<lb/>
settled by the Portuguese under royal license in 1460-61. Nothing is said<lb/>
of their health conditions during settlement, but from the quick success<lb/>
of the venture and the absence of any report of sickness, there was proba-<lb/>
bly none of a serious nature at this time. Indeed, the islands having<lb/>
been previously uninhabited, no infection confined to men could have<lb/>
occurred unless brought by the Portuguese settlers.</p>
<p>Later, this group, and especially its principal island, S&atilde;o Thiago, was<lb/>
reported by the seafaring men of many nations as very unhealthful and<lb/>
at times pestilential. This was natural. Because of their location and<lb/>
commercial relations, these islands were peculiarly liable not only to<lb/>
receive any infections, existing on the west coast of Africa, but also to<lb/>
concentrate them and to become a focus for their dissemination among<lb/>
Europeans. The main factors in this were: first, and chiefly, their<lb/>
relation to the African slave trade, and second the use of S&atilde;o Thiago as a<lb/>
port of call.</p>
<p>RELATION TO THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE</p>
<p>The source of the African slaves was the mainland. Angola and,<lb/>
to a much less extent, S&atilde;o Jorge da Mina were the centers of collection<lb/>
for slaves from Portuguese West Africa. Many, too, came a little later<lb/>
from the Benin district, though this region was not claimed as under<lb/>
Portuguese suzerainty. The ultimate destination of the slaves was<lb/>
principally tropical America; at first to Spanish settlements, and later<lb/>
to those of other nations as they were established.</p>
<p>As only Portuguese ships were allowed to enter the Portuguese ports<lb/>
of the mainland of West Africa, and only Spanish ships were allowed to<lb/>
trade with the Spanish ports of America, obviously legal trade between<lb/>
Portuguese West Africa and Spanish America could not be direct, except<lb/>
during the time from 1581 to 1640, when Portugal and Spain were under<lb/>
the same crown. To provide for this trade the island of S&atilde;o Thiago,<lb/>
in the Cape Verdes, was made an intermediate depot and distributing<lb/>
center. To this place slaves were brought, in Portuguese vessels, from<lb/>
the mainland and, this being a free port (as were those on other Portuguese<lb/>
231<lb/>
<pb n="232" id="Cb000248"/>
232<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
islands) from it vessels of other nations carried the slaves purchased here<lb/>
to their American possessions. In the sixteenth century the slaves were<lb/>
carried from S&atilde;o Thiago, mainly by Spanish vessels, to the West Indies.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>
<p>If, then, yellow fever had been in Portuguese West Africa, S&atilde;o Thiago,<lb/>
from its close communication with the Guinea coast, and from the pres-<lb/>
ence of the crews of many European vessels, would be especially apt to<lb/>
be infected with that disease, and would be more apt to be a source of<lb/>
infection to European vessels, bound for the Americas, than Guinea it-<lb/>
self, because the index of infection of the <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> at S&atilde;o Thiago would<lb/>
be kept high by the continued introduction of susceptible men.</p>
<p>The presence of a large number of European vessels here not only<lb/>
would serve, by the presence of their crews, to continue this infection<lb/>
here, but by developing epidemics among them after leaving, would<lb/>
make the disease noticeable; and vessels bound for the tropics would<lb/>
furnish an ideal mechanism for its conveyance to infectible territory.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p>
<p>We have record that in later years slavers were frequently infected<lb/>
with, and conveyed, yellow fever to the New World; and if the depot<lb/>
from which they drew their slaves was infected with that disease in early<lb/>
times, they would unquestionably have done so then.</p>
<p>S&Atilde;O THIAGO A PORT OF CALL</p>
<p>In addition to being a depot for the slave trade, S&atilde;o Thiago was a port<lb/>
of call between Europe and the New World, universally used by the<lb/>
Portuguese, by the Spanish between 1581 and 1640, and very generally<lb/>
by the ships of all nations. This might, indeed, bring no yellow fever to</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> There was also a considerable trade in slaves taken from parts of the African<lb/>
coast not under Portuguese control, and carried legally to the French, Dutch, and<lb/>
English colonies in America, also--illegally--to the Spanish colonies, sometimes<lb/>
by connivance of their local authorities, and sometimes with their consent<lb/>
enforced. The Dutch were especially active in this trade during the time they<lb/>
held Angola, 1640 to 1648, taking slaves to the French Antilles and the English<lb/>
colonies as well as to their own. Later, but after the years in which we are in-<lb/>
terested (i.e. after 1648), the British became the principal carriers.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> S&atilde;o Thiago could not be infected with yellow fever unless itself infested with<lb/>
the insect vector. These it would early have received from the Guinea coast by<lb/>
sailing vessel communication if they existed there; and <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> as well as the para-<lb/>
site of yellow fever could have been transported by vessels to the American trop-<lb/>
ics. The introduction of the infection into places where few or no <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> existed,<lb/>
even in the tropics, would not have led to propagation of <hi rend="italic">yellow fever</hi> there. S&atilde;o<lb/>
Thiago early depended on rain for its potable water, so that water storage must<lb/>
have provided favorable breeding places for <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>, which at present are abun-<lb/>
dant there.</p>
<pb n="233" id="Cb000249"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
233</p>
<p>it, but would serve both to show ship-borne epidemics and to distribute<lb/>
the disease to other places in the tropics, as would the slave trade.</p>
<p>UNHEALTHFULNESS OF S&Atilde;O THIAGO</p>
<p>This place, S&atilde;o Thiago, as we have said, held a bad reputation for<lb/>
unhealthfulness among the seamen of all nations. The British Colonial<lb/>
Office (Report of 1920), it is true, states that the Cape Verdes are now<lb/>
generally healthful, which implies that in the past they presented no<lb/>
basic conditions for malaria. The report also states that, although<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> are common, there has been no yellow fever since 1854. B&eacute;ren-<lb/>
ger-F&eacute;raud (1890, pp. 139-144), however, reports its presence thereafter<lb/>
in 1862,1864, and 1868.</p>
<p>That health conditions in times past were not good, is witnessed by<lb/>
many. The &ldquo;Portuguese Pilot,&rdquo; whose account of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; has been<lb/>
given in the preceding chapter, comments on the freedom of that island<lb/>
from any recorded &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">pestilentia</hi>,&rdquo; &ldquo;as has happened to the Cape de Verdes,<lb/>
where it raged, one time, it is said, with an extreme violence.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> Sir<lb/>
Richard Hawkins, &ldquo;The Compleate Seaman,&rdquo; than whom no one was<lb/>
more competent to speak of matters relating to the sea at this time, in<lb/>
his account of his voyage of 1593 to the South Sea (Hawkins, 1622,<lb/>
pp. 27-29) has this to say of the Cape Verdes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These islands are held to be scituate in one of the most unhealthiest<lb/>
Climates of the world and therefore it is wisedome to shunne the sight<lb/>
of them, how much more to make abode in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In two times that I have beene in them either cost vs the one halfe of<lb/>
our people with Fevers and Fluxes of sundry kinds . . . . and in one of<lb/>
them it cost me six moneths sicknesse with no small hazard of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the commerce of S&atilde;o Thiago, he says that it has &ldquo;great trade by<lb/>
reason of the neighbor-hood they haue with Guyne and Bynne&rdquo; (Guinea<lb/>
and Benin); &ldquo;but the principall is the buying and selling of Negroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving such general statements, we take up particular instances of<lb/>
infections contracted at S&atilde;o Thiago.</p>
<p>EXPEDITION OF DRAKE AND CARLEILL, 1585</p>
<p>In 1585 Drake and Carleill sailed from England on September 12,<lb/>
with 2,300 men all told, soldiers and seamen, in twenty-five vessels. On<lb/>
November 16, &ldquo;in the evening&rdquo; they landed 1,000 men or more on the</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> This epidemic B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud notes as possibly yellow fever. Save that a<lb/>
general and fatal epidemic is indicated, and in the tropics, no reason is seen for<lb/>
doing so. He cites no other evidence than the allusion by the &ldquo;Portuguese Pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="234" id="Cb000250"/>
<p>234<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>island of S&atilde;o Thiago of the Cape Verdes and took the city of that<lb/>
name with little resistance. They stayed &ldquo;fourteen days,&rdquo; going inland<lb/>
about twelve miles, and reshipped November 26, setting sail the same<lb/>
evening.</p>
<p>These dates and the statement that they stayed &ldquo;fourteen days&rdquo; are<lb/>
taken verbatim from <hi rend="italic">A Summarie and True Discourse of Sir Francis<lb/>
Drakes West-Indian Voyage, etc.</hi> (Bigges, 1652).<hi rend="superscript">4</hi></p>
<p>Obviously, landing the evening of November 16, and sailing the 26th,<lb/>
they could have remained on the island only <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> days. The chronicler<lb/>
(Drake's lieutenant) must have counted the whole time the vessels were<lb/>
among the islands. He is quite certain to have been correct on all the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">dates</hi> given, which were doubtless taken from the ship's log, especially<lb/>
as he notes that the day the town was taken was the seventeenth of<lb/>
November, Queen Elizabeth's coronation day, in honor of which the<lb/>
English fired great salvos from the captured guns.</p>
<p>After leaving the islands, the narrative continues: &ldquo;We were not<lb/>
many days at sea but there began amongst our people such mortality as,<lb/>
in a few days, there were dead above two or three hundred men and<lb/>
untill some seven or eight dayes after our coming from Saint Jago there<lb/>
had not dyed any one man of sicknesse in all the Fleet: the sicknesse<lb/>
shewed not his infection wherewith so many were strocken untill we were<lb/>
departed thence and then seazed our people with extreme hot burning<lb/>
and continuall ague whereof some very few escaped with life and yet<lb/>
those, for the most part, not without great alteration and decay of their<lb/>
wits and strength for a long time after. In some that dyed were plainly<lb/>
shewed the small sports (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) which are often found upon those that be<lb/>
infective with the Plague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were eighteen or nineteen days before reaching the island of<lb/>
Dominica, in the West Indies, where they took water. They spent some<lb/>
days in late December at St. Kitts, uninhabited at that time, to rest their<lb/>
sick people; landed 1,000 to 1,200 men on Hispaniola, on New Year's Day,<lb/>
about ten miles west of Isabela; took the city, and stayed there the space<lb/>
of one month, until it was ransomed. They then went to Cartagena,<lb/>
which they captured, and stayed there six weeks, while the ransom was<lb/>
being raised. While at Cartagena, &ldquo;the sicknesse with mortality before<lb/>
spoken of <hi rend="italic">still continuing among us</hi>&rdquo; (italics the writer's) &ldquo;though not<lb/>
with the same fury as at first,&rdquo; they gave up their original design of going<lb/>
to Nombre de Dios and thence across to Panama.</p>
<p>Our chronicler further adds of this outbreak: &ldquo;such as were touched</p>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
235</p>
<p>with the said Sicknesse escaping death very few, or almost none could<lb/>
recover their strength, yea many of them were much decayed in their<lb/>
memory; in so much that it was growne an ordinary judgement, when<lb/>
one was heard to speak foolishly to say he had beene sicke of the Calen-<lb/>
tour, which is the Spanish name of their burning Ague; for, as I told you<lb/>
before, it is a very burning and pestilent Ague. The originall cause<lb/>
thereof, is imputed to the evening or first night ayre, which they tearme<lb/>
La <hi rend="italic">serena</hi>, wherein they say and hold very firme opinion, that who so is<lb/>
then abroad in the open ayre, shall certainly be infected to the death,<lb/>
not being of the <hi rend="italic">Indian</hi> or naturall race of those Countrey People: by<lb/>
holding their Watch, were thus subjected to the infectious ayre, which<lb/>
at <hi rend="italic">S. Jago</hi> was most dangerous and deadly of all other places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fleet returned to England via St. Augustine, which they captured<lb/>
and burned, thence by Roanoke Island, where they took off Lane's<lb/>
starving colony, arriving at Portsmouth July 28, 1586. No sickness<lb/>
is recorded on the return trip. On the whole voyage they had lost &ldquo;in<lb/>
all 750 men, counting those killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For identification of the &ldquo;Calentour,&rdquo; we have that it was: (1) a<lb/>
disease of high mortality, (2) developing and prevailing aboard ships on<lb/>
the high seas, and (3) picked up--or developing soon after leaving--a<lb/>
port in the tropics notoriously unhealthful.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> Of these three things we<lb/>
are certain, and they are characteristic, even if not distinctive, of yellow<lb/>
fever. One must, however, consider in addition to yellow fever, the<lb/>
possibility of <hi rend="italic">scurvy, smallpox, typhus, plague</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">malaria</hi>. Nothing else<lb/>
had been liable to occur in such an epidemic aboard ship or to have been<lb/>
picked up here.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Scurvy</hi> would not have occurred with severity so soon after leaving<lb/>
port, where the men had certainly refreshed themselves.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Smallpox</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dysentery</hi>, being well known, had certainly been named.</p>
<p>For <hi rend="italic">plague</hi>, as sudden and great an explosion had been impossible,<lb/>
except in the pneumonic form, and this form of plague is not a disease of<lb/>
hot climates, such as that of S&atilde;o Thiago. Moreover, the mortality of<lb/>
pneumonic plague, in modern times, is practically 100 per cent; and had<lb/>
this been the cause of the epidemic, there had been little mention of men<lb/>
convalescent from it. Also, one would think, pneumonic plague, in a<lb/>
forecastle, would have killed every person who stayed in it, and been</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi>There had been no deaths from sickness in the expedition until seven or eight<lb/>
days after leaving S&atilde;o Thiago.</p>
<pb n="236" id="Cb000252"/>
<p>236<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>quickly over. So, spite of the small spots they found on the dead, one<lb/>
thinks this disease may be excluded.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Typhus</hi>. The climate of S&atilde;o Thiago being distinctly tropical, and the<lb/>
subsequent voyage entirely in the tropics, any lice-borne disease would<lb/>
seem to be excluded, nor do we know of any epidemic of typhus fever<lb/>
ever reported in the Cape Verdes, although it not unfrequently pre-<lb/>
vailed in Spain and Portugal and must have been, from time to time,<lb/>
introduced into the islands.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Malaria</hi>. There was likely enough malaria at S&atilde;o Thiago, and it<lb/>
might well have occurred among the men who were ashore there--about<lb/>
1,000--but only among them. The mortality reported, however, which<lb/>
would be about 20 to 30 per cent of the men reported to have been ashore,<lb/>
is entirely too high to be characteristic of a single infection with malaria.<lb/>
Note, too, that the deaths occurred in a short space of time, as if they<lb/>
were from a single attack of acute disease, not in men worn out from<lb/>
recurrences, and that the figure we have is for community mortality, not<lb/>
case mortality. All that we have for case mortality is that &ldquo;few escaped<lb/>
with life.&rdquo; The high mortality and the sudden outbreak are clearly<lb/>
characteristic of yellow fever: not necessarily distinctive of it, however.</p>
<p>The only description given, save that it was a &ldquo;burning ague&rdquo; and<lb/>
that convalescence was slow, with mental debility, is of the small spots<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">(petechiae)</hi> on the dead. Slow convalescence is not characteristic of<lb/>
yellow fever, but <hi rend="italic">petechiae</hi> are found in this disease as well as in typhus,<lb/>
and indeed much more commonly in it than in plague. They occur<lb/>
spontaneously in bad cases, and every bite of a mosquito or other insect<lb/>
on a patient with severe yellow fever would show as a petechial spot.<lb/>
Schotte (1782), in his description of what we are sure was yellow fever,<lb/>
in Senegal, refers to <hi rend="italic">petechiae</hi> as characteristic, and so prominent that<lb/>
the name &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">febris pulicaris</hi>&rdquo; had been proposed.</p>
<p>The writer has just noted certain data given in this account as charac-<lb/>
teristic, even if not distinctive, of yellow fever. He thinks that when, to<lb/>
these three points, we add (4) the elimination of the diseases which he has<lb/>
shown should be eliminated, and (5) the presence of <hi rend="italic">petechiae</hi>, the evi-<lb/>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>

<p>more probable diagnosis than any of the others that could reasonably be<lb/>
assumed.</p>
<p>If we knew how long the disease continued aboard ship and to what<lb/>
degree, if any, it occurred among those who had not been ashore; or<lb/>
whether it spread from ship to ship, we would have a better chance to<lb/>
determine its nature. If one only had the logs of these vessels, giving<lb/>
the names of those who were sick, the dates of going off and returning to<lb/>
duty or dying, we would know whether or not there were recurrent at-<lb/>
tacks, how long the invalidism of those who recovered lasted, and the<lb/>
duration of the sickness to death--data which should enable us to deter-<lb/>
mine absolutely, even without any description, whether the sickness was<lb/>
yellow fever or not.</p>
<p>Our chronicler believes that the fever which occurred at Cartagena<lb/>
and--implicitly--up to the time that they left that place, was the same<lb/>
as the one contracted at S&atilde;o Thiago over three and a half, or maybe four<lb/>
and a half, months previously. This, if we accept it as fact, would elim-<lb/>
inate everything but yellow fever and, indeed, yellow fever itself would<lb/>
scarcely have lasted so long save by rather slow transference from ship<lb/>
to ship. One cannot think, however, that this statement can be taken<lb/>
at its face value. Any fever occurring in Cartagena, unless extremely<lb/>
different in its symptomatology from that which had prevailed earlier,<lb/>
at sea, would be almost inevitably regarded as the same.</p>
<p>There is no direct mention of sickness during the month the force<lb/>
stayed at Hispaniola, nor indeed at any time from the first outbreak until<lb/>
the occurrence at Cartagena. Yet the language of the narrative, &ldquo;still<lb/>
continuing among us,&rdquo; strongly implies that it had persisted. Note too:<lb/>
(1) Not only was malaria usually prevalent around Cartagena, but<lb/>
they stayed there six weeks; and the implication is (it is only an im-<lb/>
plication, of course) that, at first, the sickness was not serious enough<lb/>
to influence their plans. (2) It is recorded that the Cartagena fever<lb/>
&ldquo;was not with the same fury as at first;&rdquo; and this difference in severity<lb/>
is shown by the statement that of the first outbreak on the ship, &ldquo;very<lb/>
few escaped with life&rdquo; and made a slow convalescence; while of the<lb/>
second, at Cartagena, it is said of those escaping death, that &ldquo;very few,<lb/>
or almost none could recover their strength.&rdquo; In other words, the first<lb/>
sickness had a high mortality and slow convalescence; the second one had<lb/>
a slow convalescence, but nothing is said of its mortality, except that it<lb/>
was not so great as that of the first.</p>
<p>These two accounts would fit in much better with the supposition that<lb/>
yellow fever was taken on at S&atilde;o Thiago, eliminating itself in these small<lb/>

collections of men, each ship being in itself, to some extent, a unit; and<lb/>
that, at Cartagena, the men contracted malaria, a disease sufficiently<lb/>
like yellow fever to have been quite naturally not differentiated from the<lb/>
first epidemic--assuming that to have been yellow fever.</p>
<p>SICKNESS IN OTHER EXPEDITIONS</p>
<p>There are examples of other European expeditions visiting S&atilde;o Thiago<lb/>
during the Brazilian War between the Portuguese and Hollanders,<lb/>
beginning in 1624, when the Dutch Admiral Heyn captured Bahia, and<lb/>
ending in 1654.</p>
<p>Two expeditions were sent out by the Portuguese during this war:<lb/>
one in 1624 and one in 1638, both of which stopped at S&atilde;o Thiago, and<lb/>
both developed at this place (or soon after leaving it) epidemics of greater<lb/>
or less extent and severity.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Menezes</hi>. In 1624 and 1625 the section of the Portuguese Ocean Fleet<lb/>
under Menezes, 4,000 men in 26 vessels, waiting between fifty and sixty<lb/>
days at S&atilde;o Thiago as port of call from Lisbon to Brazil, contracted a<lb/>
&ldquo;contagion&rdquo; there, from which it suffered severely. (Southey, 1817-22,<lb/>
vol. i, pp. 489-490).</p>
<p>From the statements given that a pest arose in Menezes' fleet while<lb/>
waiting here and that &ldquo;he lost many men in the fatal climate of the<lb/>
Cape de Verdes,&rdquo; we do not know whether or not this sickness persisted<lb/>
aboard the ships during the voyage to Brazil. It may all, or nearly all,<lb/>
have occurred during the fifty or sixty days he was waiting at the islands<lb/>
and not have been in any sense a ship-borne disease. Its occurrence is<lb/>
mentioned simply to show that the islands were generally unhealthful<lb/>
or pestilential.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mascarhenas</hi>, in 1638-39, with 7,000 men in 26 galleons and 20 other<lb/>
vessels, proceeding to Brazil via the Cape Verde Islands, where the<lb/>
fleet assembled, had the same unfortunate experience as Menezes, losing<lb/>
en route &ldquo;one third&rdquo; of his force, both soldiers and seamen, from a pesti-<lb/>
lence apparently contracted in the Cape Verdes. The sickness con-<lb/>
tinued aboard ship until they reached Brazil, so that they were too weak<lb/>
to attack Pernambuco, as intended, and it was necessary to proceed to<lb/>
Bahia &ldquo;as to an hospital&rdquo; (Southey, 1817-22, vol. i, p. 650).<hi rend="superscript">7</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> Of this expedition, William Piso (1648, <hi rend="italic">lib.</hi> ii, <hi rend="italic">cap.</hi> xviii) says: &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Anno 1639<lb/>

also by Baerle (1660) and da Rocha Pitta (1730); and B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud (1890, p. 28)<lb/>
cites Ferreira da Rosa as giving an account of it. Da Rosa being a physician, the</p>
<pb n="239" id="Cb000255"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
239</p>
<p>Mascarhenas stayed no great time at these islands--the writer cannot<lb/>
find exactly how long--but the sickness continued aboard ship during the<lb/>
entire voyage to Brazil and quite certainly afterwards, since he went<lb/>
from Pernambuco to Bahia &ldquo;as to an hospital.&rdquo; The date of his leaving<lb/>
the Cape Verdes is not known, nor the time occupied in the passage,<lb/>
but the recorded times of four expeditions made about this time--by<lb/>
Pieter Heyn, 1624; Menezes, 1624; Adriansen, 1630; and Andrada, 1685--<lb/>
give about forty-two days as the average for this voyage.</p>
<p>Except that we have no description of the sickness, the data presented<lb/>
for this epidemic are strikingly like those for that in Drake's expedition<lb/>
of 1585. As in the latter, we have here a ship-borne disease of high mor-<lb/>
tality; contracted at the same island; lasting aboard ship in this case cer-<lb/>
tainly during the entire voyage to Brazil, which was probably about forty-<lb/>
three days, to which may be added the time from Pernambuco to Bahia,<lb/>
usually about fourteen days. The writer is inclined to apply, indeed<lb/>
feels justified in applying, the same analysis to this as to Drake's epi-<lb/>
demic, and considers that the data are strongly indicative of yellow fever.</p>
<p>B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud (1890, p. 28), who accepts the sickness in Mascar-<lb/>
henas' fleet as probably yellow fever, thinks that it was likely introduced<lb/>
by the fleet into Brazil, and that it prevailed in 1640 in Pernambuco<lb/>
(where Mascarhenas did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> land), and elsewhere &ldquo;in Brazil&rdquo; in 1643.<lb/>
He quotes to this effect, M'Kinlay and Lepoix, but an examination of<lb/>
these references shows no sufficient reason for the belief. More than<lb/>
forty years later, in 1686, an epidemic of yellow fever, severe and gen-<lb/>
eral, prevailed in both sections of Pernambuco, Recife and Olinda, and<lb/>
in Bahia, where Mascarhenas had landed his sick (da Rocha Pitta,<lb/>
1730). It was recorded in both places as an absolutely <hi rend="italic">new</hi> disease,<lb/>
and apparently in a community virgin to it. Yellow fever might, of<lb/>
course, have been introduced into Bahia by Mascarhenas (I cannot see<lb/>
how he had any opportunity to do so in Pernambuco), but unless the<lb/>
town was then sufficiently infested with <hi rend="italic">A &euml;des aegypti</hi>, the disease could<lb/>
not have established itself. That no yellow fever showed in Brazil<lb/>
prior to 1686, notwithstanding its long traffic with the Cape Verdes and<lb/>
the west coast of Africa, may well have been due to there having been</p>

far as he knows, however, the only book ascribed to da Rosa is the <hi rend="italic">Trattado<lb/>
Unico da Constitui&ccedil;am Pestilencial de Pernambuco</hi> (Lisbon, 1694). Positively<lb/>
no note of it is in this book. Had da Rosa identified the sickness in the fleet<lb/>
or even compared it with the one treated of in this book, which was yellow<lb/>
fever, we might have had some useful data.</p>

<p>EDITORS' NOTE: The author's notes for this portion of his manuscript include<lb/>
data on two other naval expeditions which suffered fatal epidemics after stopping<lb/>
at the Cape Verde Islands. These are the fleets of Baldwin Hendricksz, sent by<lb/>
the Dutch to Bahia in 1625, and that of Gomez Freyre de Andrada, proceeding, in<lb/>
1685, from Lisbon to Maranham. Concerning Hendricksz' expedition, the refer-<lb/>
ences given (Southey, de Laet, and Brito Freire), with others that have been<lb/>
available, leave in doubt what communication, if any, the fleet had with the Cape<lb/>
Verde Islands. In Andrada's expedition, the history of a stop at these islands and<lb/>
of fatal sickness at sea thereafter is sufficiently definite, but satisfactory details<lb/>
of the nature of the sickness, its time of occurrence, duration, and mortality have<lb/>
not been found. Moreover, the date of this expedition is well beyond the limit<lb/>
(1648) of the author's inquiry. It has, therefore, seemed unnecessary to include<lb/>
the incomplete accounts of these expeditions, as the author considered the data<lb/>
inconclusive.</p>

<head>THE CANARY ISLANDS AND VAN DER DOES' EXPEDITION </head>
<pb n="241" id="Cb000257"/>
<p>DISCOVERY AND SETTLEMENT</p>
<p>The Canaries, believed to be the half-mythological &ldquo;Fortunate Isles&rdquo;<lb/>
of the ancients, are said to have been visited, about 40 B. C., by Juba of<lb/>
Mauretania and, in the twelfth century, by Arab traders, but they re-<lb/>
mained unknown to the Europeans until discovered--or rediscovered--<lb/>
in the fourteenth century. They were then inhabited by a white race<lb/>
known as the Guanches, who were in the Stone-Age period of culture.<lb/>
They seem to have been an exceptionally fine people. They embraced<lb/>
Christianity readily, absorbed the culture of the Spaniards, and a number<lb/>
of them are recorded as being in ecclesiastical and legal positions, and<lb/>
some even as hidalgoes of Spain.</p>
<p>The Spanish occupation of the islands was begun in 1402 by Jean de<lb/>
B&eacute;thencourt, Sieur de Caux, and Gadifer de la Salle, both Normans, and<lb/>
was completed in 1495 by Alonzo de Lugo, who conquered Teneriffe, the<lb/>
last of the islands to be subdued.</p>
<p>There was a very severe epidemic in Teneriffe during its conquest,<lb/>
in 1494-95 (Espinosa; also Nu&ntilde;ez de la Pe&ntilde;a). This &rdquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>&rdquo; is<lb/>
accounted by Finlay (1904) as probably yellow fever, imported from<lb/>
Santo Domingo by the vessels which Columbus sent back with Torres,<lb/>
in March, 1494. Raging among a wild, pastoral people in the moun-<lb/>
tains, and sparing the Spaniards in a fortified camp at a river's mouth, it<lb/>
could not have been yellow fever. It was quite surely some disease<lb/>
imported from Spain, and to which the Spaniards were immune by<lb/>
previous attack, as they paid no attention whatever to this sickness and<lb/>
evidently had no fear of it. Even then, without absolutely accepting<lb/>
the statement of good Father Nu&ntilde;ez de la Pe&ntilde;a (p. 153) that &ldquo;not one<lb/>
Christian nor any citizen of the Kingdom of Guimar, in which dwelt the<lb/>
Most Holy Image" (of Our Lady of Candelaria) &ldquo;was touched by this<lb/>
pestilence,&rdquo; we can be quite sure that the Spaniards at least escaped it<lb/>
and considered themselves immune.</p>
<p>The name, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>,&rdquo; given to the sickness by the-Spaniards, would<lb/>
imply that it was probably typhus, then endemic in Spain, although<lb/>
measles and perhaps influenza are also possibilities. One of these would<lb/>
241<lb/>
<pb n="242" id="Cb000258"/>
242<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
account better than typhus for the rapid spread of the epidemic. Small-<lb/>
pox, one thinks, had been mentioned by name and at least feared by the<lb/>
Spaniards. It was not yellow fever.</p>
<p>TRADE AND COMMUNICATIONS</p>
<p>Before the &ldquo;sixty years' captivity,&rdquo; 1581 to 1640, inclusive, when<lb/>
Portugal was under the Spanish crown, there was no direct legal trade<lb/>
between the Canaries and the Portuguese possessions on the African<lb/>
mainland, hence there was little chance for infections to be brought<lb/>
directly from that coast to the islands. There was, however, some com-<lb/>
munication between the Canaries and the Cape Verdes, and there was<lb/>
importation of African slaves from S&atilde;o Thiago by Spanish vessels into<lb/>
the Canaries. Thus, prior to 1581, the main--perhaps the only--chance<lb/>
of infections coming from the West African coast to the Canaries, was<lb/>
indirectly through S&atilde;o Thiago, that port being liable to infection from<lb/>
Guinea and likely itself to infect the Canaries.</p>
<p>From 1581 to 1640, however, all legal restrictions against Portuguese<lb/>
commerce with the Canaries were removed, so that Portuguese as well<lb/>
as Spanish vessels could then carry slaves to these islands, either from<lb/>
S&atilde;o Thiago or directly from the Guinea coast.</p>
<p>In addition, the Canaries were used as ports of call, especially, but not<lb/>
exclusively, for Spanish vessels between Africa and the Peninsula.<lb/>
Gran Canaria, the principal port, was larger, had a better food supply,<lb/>
and was more healthy than S&atilde;o Thiago, hence was more used by the<lb/>
vessels of both nations.</p>
<p>This communication and the fact that the Canaries had a very consid-<lb/>
erable population susceptible to yellow fever--not only the inhabitants,<lb/>
Guanches and Spaniards, but also the crews of European ships stopping<lb/>
there--would, during this time, have rendered these islands, especially<lb/>
the principal ones, Gran Canaria and Teneriffe, liable to receive the<lb/>
infection of yellow fever if it existed on the African coast and to propa-<lb/>
gate it, for a time at least, when received. There were the same reasons<lb/>
for this during this time as those we have given for the same thing in S&atilde;o<lb/>
Thiago, both for the introduction and the retention of the infection.<lb/>
The Canaries were less close to the Guinea coast than the Cape Verdes<lb/>
and, on account of Spanish law, could not be visited by foreign vessels,<lb/>
but the susceptible population was very much larger than at S&atilde;o<lb/>
Thiago.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>

<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
243</p>
<p>THE EXPEDITION OF VAN DER DOES, 1599</p>
<p>In the summer of 1599 the Dutch Admiral Pieter Van der Does at-<lb/>
tacked and captured the island of Gran Canaria. Thereafter, with one<lb/>
half of his fleet, he sailed south. We have three sources of information<lb/>
on this expedition.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) An Englishman who accompanied the fleet as master of a victualler<lb/>
was interviewed, after his return to England, in the fall of the same<lb/>
year, by Hakluyt, who gives us, in some detail, the proceedings in the<lb/>
Canaries.</item>
<item>(2) Dr. G. F. Pop, getting his data from the Royal Archives of<lb/>
Holland, has given a brief account of the sickness that prevailed in the<lb/>
fleet after leaving the Canaries.</item>
<item>(3) Three visitors to S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, between 1640 and 1725, give some<lb/>
data, derived, one judges, from local records and tradition, on the<lb/>
sickness among the Dutch after they arrived there.</item></list>
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Hakluyt's narrative</hi></p>
<p>According to Hakluyt, (1885-90, vol. vi, pp. 183-204) this fleet of 73<lb/>
vessels of war, with 8,000 soldiers and seamen, anchored off the island<lb/>
of Gran Canaria June 26, 1599. The castle was carried by storm, in<lb/>
which Van der Does received several wounds. The city was entered<lb/>
on June 29 and plundered, the inhabitants having abandoned it the<lb/>
day before. The town was burnt and the castle blown up July 4, and<lb/>
the Dutch went aboard ship the next day, that is after six days ashore<lb/>
and three days additional in the harbor. They went ashore again July<lb/>
9, and stayed until the 15th. This last landing seems to have been at<lb/>
the island of Gomara, on which they plundered a small town. They<lb/>
finally weighed anchor and left July 21, one half sailing back to Holland<lb/>
under Admiral Gebransten, with whom went Hakluyt's informant,<lb/>
reaching the Texel September 10.</p>
<p>tinued (recognizably) in any island longer than the second year. According to<lb/>
B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud, citing for the earlier occurrences Busto y Blanco, whose work<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Topograf&iacute;a M&eacute;dico, de las Islas Canarias</hi>, Seville, 1864) has not been available to<lb/>
us, epidemics of yellow fever occurred in the Canaries in 1701, 1771-72, 1810-11,<lb/>
1862, and 1888. B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud thinks it possible that earlier epidemics, reported<lb/>
as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">peste</hi>&rdquo; in 1512,1531,1582,1599, 1601, and 1606, may have been yellow fever, but<lb/>
no reasons are given for this suspicion. The epidemics of 1701 and later may be<lb/>
accepted as authentic, and their occurrence as <hi rend="italic">epidemics</hi> implies, of course, that<lb/>
during this period yellow fever was <hi rend="italic">not endemic</hi> on the islands. This inference<lb/>
does not necessarily extend, however, to earlier years.</p>

<p>This record is contemporary, and the data were undoubtedly taken 
from the ship's log. Hence, the <hi rend="italic">dates</hi> are reliable.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Pop's account</hi></p>
<p>Pop (1867, p. 126), a physician, writing of the history of the medical<lb/>
service of the Dutch Navy, using records in the Royal Archives from<lb/>
1597,says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first important <hi rend="italic">epidemic sickness</hi> among sailors of which we find<lb/>
mention in these records, is that which occurred in 1599 in Admiral van<lb/>
der Does' fleet. Including the soldiers there were 8,000 men on board<lb/>
the 73 vessels of the fleet. The purpose of this expedition, the destruc-<lb/>
tion of the Spanish naval force at Coru&ntilde;a, miscarried, because the Span-<lb/>
iards received timely warning of its approach. With half of the ships<lb/>
the course was now continued to the Canary Islands and thence to St.<lb/>
Thomas. On the passage across the Tropic of Cancer an unknown,<lb/>
contagious, and pestilential sickness broke out, of which,on the Admiral's<lb/>
ship alone, 15 people died before the passing of the Line" (Equator).<lb/>
"It was a burning and raging fever, called &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">calentura</hi>&rsquo; by the Spaniards,<lb/>
caused by an alteration of the atmosphere, because the latitude was<lb/>
very ill-adapted to the constitutions of the sailors, especially because<lb/>
of the incessant rain which caused great foulness, stink, and worms on the<lb/>
ships. Sailing (on) to St. Thomas there developed again a severe sick-<lb/>
ness which was called scurvy (&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">scheurbuik</hi>&rsquo;).<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> But while the ships were<lb/>
lying at the island, the sickness in the men increased to such extent that<lb/>
1,000 sailors and the Commander-in-chief died there. On the homeward<lb/>
journey, which was undertaken speedily, the sickness and mortality<lb/>
continued; nor were the officers spared, for all but two of the ships'<lb/>
captains died. When we recall that the Spaniards, at St. Domingo, at<lb/>
that time called yellow fever calentura--which name had been adopted<lb/>
by the English who, under Drake, had suffered severely from yellow<lb/>
fever--then we may conclude that yellow fever prevailed in Admiral<lb/>
van der Does' fleet, and was contracted on the Canary islands, where<lb/>
the seamen had been some time ashore. . . . . That the sickness which<lb/>
arose sailing to St. Thomas was scurvy, may well be; but lying off the<lb/>
shore of this island a high mortality from this disease is not to be ex-<lb/>
plained. For on the English ships at St. Thomas the sufferers from scurvy<lb/>
were quickly cured by the use of lemons, as was the case with the crews</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> This is given by Pop as a quotation &ldquo;from a manuscript in the files of the expe-<lb/>
dition (Royal Archives).&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="245" id="Cb000261"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
245</p>
<p>of the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Norwich</hi>.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> There is, then, more ground for the<lb/>
belief that the Dutch fleet was affected on that island with severe malar-<lb/>
ial fever which was then endemic there. Indeed, the malarial infection<lb/>
there was so severe that the resulting fevers had become proverbial and<lb/>
were considered the most malignant in Africa or America, while Lind<lb/>
calls quinine the only remedy for them. We need not be surprised then,<lb/>
to find that even on the homeward journey these seamen, already so<lb/>
reduced in health, continued to suffer from severe illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the destination of that half of the fleet which did not return to<lb/>
Holland, Hakluyt's victualler--who did not go beyond the Canaries,<lb/>
and was hardly in the Admiral's confidence--says they sailed &ldquo;for the<lb/>
West Indians.&rdquo; Pop says merely &ldquo;to St. Thomas,&rdquo; and B&eacute;renger-<lb/>
F&eacute;raud (1890, p. 28), citing Pop, interprets this as meaning &ldquo;St. Thomas<lb/>
of the Antilles.&rdquo; Possibly he was misled by Pop's allusion to the experi-<lb/>
ence of British ships at St. Thomas--which does refer to &ldquo;St. Thomas<lb/>
of the Antilles,&rdquo; but to an occurrence more than 100 years later. What-<lb/>
ever its origin, the inference is wrong, for it is quite certain that the fleet<lb/>
went not to the West Indies but to the island of St. Thomas (S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;)<lb/>
off the coast of Africa.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Accounts of Dapper, Barbot, and Labat</hi></p>
<p>As a third source of information about the sickness in this fleet, we<lb/>
have the reports written by Dapper (1676), Barbot (1732), and Labat<lb/>
(1731), the three travellers whose descriptions of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; have been<lb/>
given in a preceding chapter. All of these mention Van der Does'<lb/>
capture of the island and the great mortality which his forces suffered<lb/>
there. It is a question how much reliance can be placed upon their<lb/>
accounts. They wrote from 50 to 125 years after the event, and we do<lb/>
not know from what sources they drew. They all make a mistake of<lb/>
eleven years in the date of the raid, which they give as 1610 instead of<lb/>
1599, and all give Van der Does' name as &ldquo;Verdoes,&rdquo; obvious errors<lb/>
which do not speak well for their accuracy in other details. The uni-<lb/>
formity of the reports is, we think, evidence not of reliability, but rather<lb/>
of their having used a common source or copied one from the other.</p>

forces when he captured S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; in 1641, has already been given</p>

the <hi rend="italic">Danish</hi> island of <hi rend="italic">St. Thomas</hi>,&rdquo; in the West Indies. The date, not given, is<lb/>
apparently in the first half of the eighteenth century.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>(see p. 229), says: &ldquo;This poisoned air caused a mortality greater yet<lb/>
among those whom Admiral Pieter Verdoes commanded, when, in the<lb/>
month of November, 1610, he took possession of this island with all of his<lb/>
fleet, for there died in less than 15 days more than 1,000 people, all of this<lb/>
sickness, endemic and peculiar to this country, which principally made<lb/>
itself known by pains in the head and of the belly. The Admiral him-<lb/>
self died, and Vice-Admiral Storm, besides 17 Captains of vessels and all<lb/>
of those of the land army save one. The fury of this general and con-<lb/>
tagious sickness went finally so far and made such great ravages that<lb/>
bodies were opened.&rdquo; The only appearance noted seems to have been<lb/>
that the intra-abdominal fat was melted and fluid, and hence the name<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">gras fondu</hi>&rdquo; (melted fat) was given to this illness.</p>
<p>Barbot, speaking of the diseases prevalent on the island, says: &ldquo;Cho-<lb/>
licks are there so terrible as to distract the patient in three or four days.&rdquo;<lb/>
. . . . &ldquo;This sort of cholick has swept away an incredible number of people.<lb/>
. . . . It . . . . with the bloody-flux, killed such a number of <hi rend="italic">Dutch</hi> men<lb/>
the two several times they subdued the island, in the years 1610, and<lb/>
1641 . . . . that the island was then known in <hi rend="italic">Holland</hi> by the name of<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Dutch Churchyard</hi> . . . . The first expedition was under Admiral<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Pieter Verdoes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Vander Does</hi>, in the month of <hi rend="italic">November</hi>, 1610, with<lb/>
seventeen men of war . . . . he stormed the town and carry'd it. . . . .<lb/>
Soon after the country distempers seized them in such manner that above<lb/>
a thousand soldiers died; as did also the admiral <hi rend="italic">Verdoes</hi>, his vice-<lb/>
admiral <hi rend="italic">Storm</hi>, and all the officers of the land-forces, except one only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Labat's account is similar: &ldquo;Fort San Sebastian resisted in 1610 the<lb/>
army of the Hollanders .. . . commanded by the Admiral Pierre Verdoes,<lb/>
who made himself master of the city. . . . . The bravery of the Portuguese<lb/>
Governor and of his garrison was powerfully aided by the maladies of<lb/>
which we have spoken previously, which, in less than fifteen days,<lb/>
carried away the Admiral; Vice-Admiral; 17 captains of vessels and sev-<lb/>
eral other officers and the greater part of the troops which had been put<lb/>
ashore, of which all the Captains perished except one. All the rest would<lb/>
have had the same fate if they had persisted in this enterprise. It was<lb/>
necessary then to abandon it and to return to Holland with the debris of<lb/>
this unhappy fleet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Labat adds this description of the sickness among the Dutch, but<lb/>
whether it refers solely to the epidemic in Jol's forces in 1641, or also to<lb/>
that in Van der Does' fleet, is not altogether clear from the context.<lb/>
&ldquo;The most part died of an ardent, putrid fever, accompanied with a<lb/>
headache so violent that they became foolish and as insane. Some</p>
<pb n="247" id="Cb000263"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
247</p>
<p>others were tormented with pains in the bowels so excessive that the<lb/>
strongest could hardly bear them to the 4th day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The data which we have from the several sources we have quoted are:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) The entire fleet of 73 vessels was in or near the Canary Islands<lb/>
from June 26 to July 21, and at least a part of the men were ashore<lb/>
there for some days.</item>
<item>(2) Leaving the Canaries, one half the fleet returned to Holland, and<lb/>
the other half, under Van der Does, went to S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;. The half that<lb/>
returned to Holland made a slow voyage, but there is no mention of<lb/>
sickness among them.</item>
<item>(3) In the half of the fleet that went to S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; an epidemic broke<lb/>
out while crossing the Tropic of Cancer, of which 15 men on the Com-<lb/>
mander-in-chief's ship died before the Equator was crossed.</item>
<item>(4) Later there was very much more sickness, which caused great mor-<lb/>
tality at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, and--according to Pop--on the homeward voyage.</item></list>
</p>
<p>There are several questions here.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) What was the nature of the epidemic which appeared when the<lb/>
fleet reached the Tropic of Cancer, and of which fifteen men died on the<lb/>
Admiral's ship before the passing of the Equator? Except that it was<lb/>
&ldquo;a burning, raging fever, called by the Spaniards &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">calentura</hi>,&rsquo;&rdquo; there is no<lb/>
description of this disease on the flagship, and extremely little epi-<lb/>
demiological data. As Gran Canaria is, at most, not over 270 miles<lb/>
in a direct line from the Tropic of Cancer, where the sickness &ldquo;broke<lb/>
out,&rdquo; I think we can exclude scurvy; the time after leaving land seems<lb/>
too short. The men, those of the Admiral's ship especially, from the<lb/>
prominent part he bore in the attack, were quite certainly ashore and<lb/>
had a chance of eating green things and fresh meat at Gran Canaria,<lb/>
where they stayed in all at least nine days, besides six or more at Gomara.<lb/>
The low latitude and the fact that the time was midsummer should,<lb/>
one thinks, rule out typhus, which, too, would scarcely have been called<lb/>
an &ldquo;unknown malady,&rdquo; as it was a common disease of the north Euro-<lb/>
pean countries, both ashore and aboard ship. The same reasons hold<lb/>
for rejecting plague as are given for so doing in Drake's expedition.<lb/>
None of the Canaries have ever been regarded as malarious, and it<lb/>
scarcely seems reasonable to suppose that Van der Does would have<lb/>
picked up enough malaria there, in so short a stay ashore, as to have<lb/>
caused 15 deaths aboard a single ship.<lb/>
Whether the sickness at this time was on any other ship than the<lb/>
Admiral's we do not know, nor is the number of her crew given; but<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Revenge</hi>, Drake's flagship in the. fight with the Armada, and hence<lb/>
<pb n="248" id="Cb000264"/>
248<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
clearly a ship of the first class, had 150 men as her full crew in her last<lb/>
fight in the Azores, in 1591. Unless the Dutchman, then, had a very<lb/>
much larger crew, the loss is too heavy to have been caused by malaria,<lb/>
aboard ship on the high seas, from a single short exposure ashore, even<lb/>
in a badly infected port--which Gran Canaria was not.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi><lb/>
Pop accepts this as yellow fever, and such facts as he gives point in this<lb/>
direction--the sudden outbreak at sea of an acute fever, &ldquo;unknown,<lb/>
contagious and pestilential,&rdquo; and with a high mortality. There had<lb/>
been time, too, for the development of secondary cases of this disease<lb/>
from any primary infections contracted at Gran Canaria. We have,<lb/>
however, very little data.</item>
<item>(2) Where and under what conditions occurred the epidemic called<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">scheurbuik</hi>&rdquo; (scurvy); and was this the same as that which had caused<lb/>
the 15 deaths on the Admiral's ship? The manuscript that Pop quotes<lb/>
says the epidemic of &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">scheurbuik</hi>&rdquo; broke out &ldquo;sailing to St. Thomas,&rdquo;<lb/>
which would make it no great time after the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">calentura.</hi>&rdquo; Whether or<lb/>
not Pop is right in thinking that some scurvy might have occurred on<lb/>
this voyage, he is unquestionably right in declining to accept it as<lb/>
causing the great mortality at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;. This had been impossible.</item>
<item>(3) What was the nature of the sickness that caused such mortality<lb/>
at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; and on the homeward voyage? Clearly it was some dis-<lb/>
ease or diseases either brought from the Canaries or contracted at S&atilde;o<lb/>
Thom&eacute;. If brought from the Canaries--an extension of the same<lb/>
epidemic that had caused the 15 deaths on the Admiral's ship--it could<lb/>
only be yellow fever. Nothing else likely to be contracted there would<lb/>
have continued so long aboard ship and grown into such a fatal epi-<lb/>
demic. We have, however, no sufficient ground for believing that the<lb/>
sickness at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; was a continuation of that which had occurred<lb/>
en route from the Canaries, for this is only a possible, not at all a neces-<lb/>
sary, interpretation of Pop's record, while the accounts of Dapper,<lb/>
Barbot, and Labat all clearly imply that the sickness among the Dutch<lb/>
was contracted at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;--or was at least so considered--and that<lb/>
it was thought to be a disease &ldquo;endemic and peculiar to this country.&rdquo;</item></list>
</p>
<p>Of the infections prevalent on the island, we need to consider only<lb/>
those sufficiently acute and fatal to account for the mortality ashore<lb/>
in the time the Dutch were there--apparently not more than a few<lb/>
weeks--and at the same time likely to have continued aboard ship.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Netscher (1853) gives the complement of each ship in several Dutch fleets<lb/>
assembled between 1620 and 1650. The largest number mentioned on any one ship<lb/>
is 262--155 seamen and 107 soldiers.</p>
<pb n="249" id="Cb000265"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
249</p>
<p>It is true, as we have said more than once, that a sickness of high<lb/>
mortality carried a considerable time aboard ship on the high seas in the<lb/>
tropics--if we exclude cholera, of which there is no question in this part<lb/>
of Africa at this time--is apt to be yellow fever or scurvy. Neverthe-<lb/>
less, some of the conditions here are not quite the same as those we have<lb/>
hitherto encountered in ship-borne epidemics, and we must consider as<lb/>
possibilities some other diseases, especially malaria and dysentery.</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) <hi rend="italic">Malaria</hi>, naturally, would not be contracted aboard ship, except<lb/>
when lying close inshore, nor would it generally be apt to last very long<lb/>
once on the high seas, or with heavy mortality. These men, however,<lb/>
were exposed for a considerable time. The accounts from Portuguese<lb/>
sources imply that they were ashore over 15 days, and it probably was<lb/>
considerably over that, and a large number going aboard with a heavy<lb/>
infection might well make much sickness which, by recurrences in the<lb/>
men originally infected, might last for a considerable time and cause a<lb/>
number of deaths. Undoubtedly malaria was highly prevalent at S&atilde;o<lb/>
Thom&eacute;, and we would expect it to have caused a good deal of sickness<lb/>
and some deaths. Whether it would be sufficient to account for such<lb/>
mortality as Pop's account indicates is a question. To judge of this<lb/>
one would need to know more of <hi rend="italic">when</hi> the deaths occurred--how many<lb/>
ashore, how many at sea, and in what part of the voyage.</item>
<item>(2) <hi rend="italic">Dysentery</hi>, of bacillary origin, may well have been an important<lb/>
factor in the epidemic ashore: it is so indicated in Barbot's account. It<lb/>
is not considered a ship-borne disease, yet if a large number of men thus<lb/>
infected were aboard a crowded vessel, there might be propagation of it.<lb/>
One would think, however, that dysentery, well known to the Dutch,<lb/>
would have been called by name, even if this had been a more severe<lb/>
type than that with which the Hollanders were familiar. Amoebic<lb/>
dysentery is slow in evolution and could hardly account for much sick-<lb/>
ness, certainly not for many deaths before the fleet reached Holland,<lb/>
unless this trip was unusually prolonged. The same applies, with even<lb/>
more force, to <hi rend="italic">schistosomiasis mansoni</hi>.</item>
<item>(3) <hi rend="italic">The relapsing fever</hi> of the tropics--a tick-borne spirochetosis--one<lb/>
judges could not have been propagated aboard ship or, if so, for only a<lb/>
very short time and in a minor degree. Certainly the writer has been<lb/>
able to find no instance of a ship-borne epidemic of this disease, and he<lb/>
has looked for it. There are reports from the West African Coast, of<lb/>
a number of spirochetoses, said to be different from relapsing fever<lb/>
and yellow fever, although the writer doubts their certain differ-<lb/>
entiation from the former. There is no evidence that they exist, or<lb/>
<pb n="250" id="Cb000266"/>
250<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
have existed, at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, although this is possible enough. We<lb/>
know little of them except that none of them have ever been reported<lb/>
as ship-borne diseases.</item>
<item>(4) <hi rend="italic">Yellow fever</hi>, if present in S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, would have produced an<lb/>
epidemic. Some of the men would have been infected from the infective<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> already present in the city; but there would be no great epidemic<lb/>
until secondary cases developed from the men thus infected--that is at<lb/>
least three weeks after they had landed. Brought aboard ships, the<lb/>
infection would have spread and continued a long time, until checked by<lb/>
exhaustion of the human material or by cold weather.</item>
<item>(5) <hi rend="italic">Scurvy</hi>. The record which Pop quotes calls the epidemic which<lb/>
prevailed at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; and on the homeward journey &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">scheurbuik</hi>&rdquo;--<lb/>
scurvy; but the use of this name is, we think, without significance as<lb/>
indicating the presence of scurvy aboard. It is given to a sickness said<lb/>
to have prevailed at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, and scurvy had naturally been abso-<lb/>
lutely impossible to men ashore, or with easy access to shore, on a well<lb/>
populated and prosperous tropical island. It might have occurred on the<lb/>
homeward voyage; yet, as unquestionably the fleet reprovisioned at S&atilde;o<lb/>
Thom&eacute;, unless this voyage was unusually and excessively protracted,<lb/>
scurvy could not have caused much sickness and many deaths during it.<lb/>
It is possible, indeed, that what was called &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">scheurbuik</hi>&rdquo; may have been<lb/>
yellow fever. The <hi rend="italic">course of sickness</hi> in yellow fever and scurvy is<lb/>
absolutely different, yet the <hi rend="italic">appearance of those dead or near dying</hi> of<lb/>
these diseases is not dissimilar, so that one who knew scurvy only from<lb/>
description (or even from having seen the dead bodies) might well<lb/>
mistake between them. Indeed, even at much later dates many<lb/>
eminent writers (Bruce, 1759; Pringle, 1810; Arejula, 1806; and others),<lb/>
influenced, it seems, by the appearances of the sick and dead<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> believed<lb/>
that yellow fever and scurvy were at least kindred diseases.</item></list>
</p>
<p>The Dutch ship-surgeons undoubtedly had knowledge of scurvy,<lb/>
but not necessarily at first-hand, for this disease is said to have been less<lb/>
prevalent on the Dutch ships than on those of other nations-due,<lb/>
perhaps, as Lind thought, to their inclusion of pickles in the ships' stores.<lb/>
If the knowledge which the physicians of the fleet had of scurvy was<lb/>
from the descriptions given in lectures and text-books, naturally these</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> The writer himself, not unfamiliar with yellow fever, when he saw the first<lb/>
dead body submitted to autopsy at Ocean Springs, Mississippi, in 1897, remarked:<lb/>
&ldquo;It looks bad, but it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be a jaundiced man with scurvy.&rdquo; He confesses that he<lb/>
was extremely loath to accept the diagnosis of yellow fever if it was honestly<lb/>
possible to reject it, which it was not.</p>
<pb n="251" id="Cb000267"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
251</p>
<p>would stress the appearances of <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> cases, the bleeding gums, the livid<lb/>
spots and ecchymoses under the skin. These are the very appearances<lb/>
most prominent in bad and fatal cases of yellow fever.</p>
<p>It is not utterly improbable, then, that the name &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">scheurbuik</hi>&rdquo; was<lb/>
given this epidemic because the appearances of <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> cases of yellow fever<lb/>
--and especially of the dead--corresponded to the <hi rend="italic">description</hi> given of<lb/>
the same class of cases in scurvy. One can conceive no other reason for<lb/>
its use, as the epidemic was clearly not one of scurvy.</p>
<p>As we have said, one naturally expects a disease of high mortality pre-<lb/>
vailing aboard ship in the tropics to be either scurvy or yellow fever.<lb/>
Scurvy is, we believe, absolutely excluded here, and while in this case,<lb/>
as we have said, other infections are possible, we think we can claim<lb/>
that none that could reasonably be expected to be aboard so well satis-<lb/>
fies all the data that we have as yellow fever.</p>
<p>As in the case of Drake's expedition, that of Van der Does, while not<lb/>
absolutely indicating yellow fever, <hi rend="italic">does</hi> indicate it. Strongly on the way<lb/>
from Gran Canaria, much more strongly at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">6</hi> NOTE BY THE EDITORS : In the discussion which has been presented above,<lb/>
important considerations in judging the nature of the disease or diseases which<lb/>
affected Van der Does' forces are the time of occurrence, duration, and extent of<lb/>
mortality <hi rend="italic">at sea</hi>, before reaching St. Thomas, and again after leaving there; also<lb/>
the length of the stay on the island. Since none of the accounts quoted is suffi-<lb/>
ciently explicit on these points, further particulars of this expedition have been<lb/>
sought from such sources as have been accessible, especially in the hope of finding<lb/>
significant dates. The results, though meagre, indicate that, in certain respects,<lb/>
the circumstances were not quite as indicated by, or naturally inferred from, the<lb/>
reports cited by Dr. Carter, especially as regards the duration of the voyage from<lb/>
the Canaries to St. Thomas and thence to Holland.</p>
<p>The fullest accounts that we have found are those given by Bor (1621-34, book<lb/>
36, fol. 41-44) and Meteren (1614, book 21, fol. 435-436), Dutch historians who<lb/>
were contemporary with Van der Does and whose works are cited by modern his-<lb/>
torians as being authoritative for that period. Except that Bor's account is the<lb/>
more detailed, the two agree very closely. Both confirm Hakluyt's report of pro-<lb/>
ceedings in the Canaries and the dates that he gives, also his statement that on<lb/>
July 21, after the raid on Gomara, the fleet was divided, 35 ships sailing back to<lb/>
Holland under Gebransten, and 36 remaining with Van der Does. No sickness is<lb/>
mentioned in the half of the fleet which returned to Holland, arriving there in<lb/>
September.</p>
<p>The movements of the other half of the fleet are given by Bor in a letter from Van<lb/>
der Does to the States-General, written off Cape &ldquo;Lopez Gonsalves&rdquo; (on the Afri-<lb/>
can mainland, nearly opposite St. Thomas) and dated October 13, 1599. He states<lb/>
that leaving the Canaries July 21, he proceeded to the harbor of Maio, (a barren<lb/>
sparsely populated island in the Cape Verde group), anchored there August 4,<lb/>
and remained some days, taking on water. Leaving there on or before August 15,<lb/>
<pb n="252" id="Cb000268"/>
252<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
he decided to raid the Portuguese possessions on the coast of &ldquo;Guinea and Mani-<lb/>
congo&rdquo; and adjacent islands. There is mention of some Spanish and Portuguese<lb/>
merchant ships captured, but none of any raid carried out ashore up to the date of<lb/>
the letter. No sickness in the fleet is mentioned. On the contrary, he says &ldquo;all<lb/>
the officers of this fleet (except Captain Mota, who has died) are well disposed<lb/>
thank God.&rdquo; If there had indeed been an epidemic causing fifteen deaths on his<lb/>
own ship, as Pop reports, it is strange that he does not report it. The only mention<lb/>
of sickness is in the announcement of his intention to attack St. Thomas &ldquo;notwith-<lb/>
standing the unwholesomeness of the air there and along this coast, which still is<lb/>
not so black as it is painted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presumably, St. Thomas was reached within the next day or two, for the next<lb/>
date given is that of Van der Does' death, on the island, October 24, and this<lb/>
was evidently some days after landing. After his death, his successor, Storm von<lb/>
Wena, considered fortifying the island and holding it for Holland, but gave up<lb/>
the project when the engineers reported that it would take more than ten weeks--<lb/>
probably, too, because of the prevalence of sickness, this being implied by the<lb/>
return to Holland, for it had been Van der Does' intention to make other raids<lb/>
as far as Brazil. The date of leaving the island is not given, nor the length of the<lb/>
stay there. Leaving St. Thomas, the fleet returned direct to Holland, arriving<lb/>
there in February, 1600, with the exception of six or seven ships which were sent<lb/>
from St. Thomas to Brazil, reaching Holland in June, 1600.</p>
<p>Of the sickness which developed on the island, Bor says: &ldquo;And as they had now<lb/>
been long at sea and engaged in these exploits, and because the air in this country<lb/>
is very unwholesome for our people, and because our people in this hot country<lb/>
could not well regulate themselves in eating and drinking, and avoiding the fruits<lb/>
of the land; there arose among the people a sickness which is there called Calen-<lb/>
tura or la Modorra, which overcomes the people coming there from Europe: It<lb/>
melted the fat in their bodies, like melted butter lying in their bellies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There died, he says, fifteen captains of land forces and sea forces, and twelve<lb/>
hundred men, both soldiers and sailors. He does not say <hi rend="italic">when</hi> these deaths oc-<lb/>
curred, though the context refers to events on the island. However, Meteren,<lb/>
who gives the same figures, says that the mortality occurred &ldquo;mostly at sea in the<lb/>
ships, on the way home.&rdquo; Wagenaar (1782, book 33, pp. 55-56), writing later, says<lb/>
a thousand died in fifteen days at sea. He, however, represents the whole fleet as<lb/>
proceeding from St. Thomas to Brazil.</p>
<p>On the homeward journey, Bor says, &ldquo;coming to the height of the 45th and 46th<lb/>
degrees into cold air, the sudden change again caused many sicknesses, especially<lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">Scheurbuyck</hi>, of which and of other sicknesses several hundred died,&rdquo; including<lb/>
General Storm von Wena, the date of whose death is given as February 8. Met-<lb/>
eren does not specifically mention this later sickness, which Bor definitely differ-<lb/>
entiates from that previously mentioned. Both relate that for lack of men to<lb/>
handle the ships there was great difficulty in reaching port, so that one ship had to<lb/>
be abandoned, and others put into English ports, while the rest reached Holland<lb/>
with most of those on board sick.</p>
<p>These accounts, which would seem to be reliable as far as they go, if accepted,<lb/>
would modify Dr. Carter's discussion in several respects, namely:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) If any epidemic occurred between the Canaries and St. Thomas, it must<lb/>
have been of limited extent, and, if yellow fever, must have been confined to one<lb/>
<pb n="253" id="Cb000269"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
253<lb/>
or a few ships. Unless the manuscript which Pop quotes from the Royal Archives<lb/>
is the record of an eye-witness, one is justified in discounting it, in view of Van der<lb/>
Does' failure to mention an epidemic before reaching St. Thomas.</item>
<item>(2) The outbreak of sickness with great debility, on reaching cold latitudes,<lb/>
on the homeward voyage, would indicate malaria, recurring in men previously<lb/>
infected, and, since the voyage may have been of three and a half or four months'<lb/>
duration, scurvy is not excluded.</item>
<item>(3) The statements of Meteren and Wagenaar, that most of the deaths occurred<lb/>
at sea, imply that this was in the earlier part of the voyage. If this is so, and espe-<lb/>
cially if it is true that 1,000 died in fifteen days, as Wagenaar says, the evidence for<lb/>
yellow fever is much strengthened.</item></list>
</p>
<p>Since there is uncertainty about essential facts, there is, of course, no certainty<lb/>
about deductions from them, unless the requisite additional facts are available<lb/>
from other and entirely authentic sources.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX</head>
<head>SICKNESS IN AFRICA CONSIDERED TO BE CERTAINLY YELLOW FEVER</head>
<pb n="254" id="Cb000270"/>
<p>In the accounts that we have presented, we have found records of sick-<lb/>
ness on the mainland of West Africa that <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have been yellow fever,<lb/>
especially in the commercial voyages of the sixteenth century. In the<lb/>
islands off the coast, and in the fleets that visited them, we have found,<lb/>
even before 1600, what we think was very probably yellow fever. But<lb/>
neither in the records that we have quoted, nor in such others as we have<lb/>
examined, have we been able to find, prior to 1648, when yellow fever is<lb/>
identified in America, any sickness in Africa which, from its description,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">must</hi> be accepted as <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> yellow fever. For recognition of this<lb/>
disease in Africa as certainly as it is identified for us in Cogolludo's<lb/>
history of the epidemic of 1648 in Yucatan, we must pass over another<lb/>
hundred years and more, to the reports which Lind and Schotte give of<lb/>
the fevers in Senegal and Gambia. Of these two writers, only Schotte<lb/>
gives a description that is entirely definitive, but as Lind's reports are<lb/>
very commonly quoted in the literature of yellow fever, we will consider<lb/>
them first.</p>
<p>LIND</p>
<p>James Lind, a distinguished authority of his day on tropical diseases,<lb/>
on scurvy, and on naval hygiene, gives, in his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Diseases In-<lb/>
cidental to Europeans in Hot Climates</hi> (1792),<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> descriptions of several<lb/>
outbreaks which have been accepted as yellow fever--some erroneously,<lb/>
and some, we think, without sufficient proof. There is, however, one<lb/>
account in which yellow fever is very strongly, if not quite certainly,<lb/>
indicated.</p>
<p>In August, 1768, the sloop <hi rend="italic">Merlin</hi>, with a complement of about 90<lb/>
men, entered the Gambia river. &ldquo;She continued six days in the river,<lb/>
employed in wooding and watering. While there, all the men were in</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> This is the fifth edition of this treatise. The first edition, published in 1768,<lb/>
naturally does not contain the account of the fevers on the <hi rend="italic">Merlin</hi> in 1768 and<lb/>
on the <hi rend="italic">Weasel</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Hound</hi> in 1769. The writer has not been able to examine<lb/>
the intermediate editions.</p>
<p>254</p>
<pb n="255" id="Cb000271"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
255</p>
<p>perfect health, but in about two days after they put to sea, those who had<lb/>
been employed in wooding were successively taken ill; afterwards those<lb/>
who had been employed in the duty of watering, were seized in the same<lb/>
manner. At first these men alone were seized with the fever, and several<lb/>
of them a day continued to fall sick for six or seven days; at length<lb/>
almost all that had been employed on those services were ill; after them,<lb/>
their attendants were seized with the fever, and in such numbers as to<lb/>
leave no doubt of the disease being infectious&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, pp. 184-5).</p>
<p>This allows an incubation of from two to eight days for the first of<lb/>
the men ashore who fell sick, and of not less than six or seven for the<lb/>
last. Considering that the time during which the cases occurred is<lb/>
given only approximately, as &ldquo;six or seven days,&rdquo; not exactly, the inter-<lb/>
vals correspond reasonably to the known period of incubation of yellow<lb/>
fever in man. The interval of time between the onset of the first cases<lb/>
on the <hi rend="italic">Merlin</hi> and the first cases that occurred in their attendants is<lb/>
not given: it had been to us a valuable datum. We would like to know,<lb/>
too, how many of those that had been ashore sickened, and how many<lb/>
of those who had not been ashore, and how long before the last case<lb/>
occurred on board.</p>
<p>The fact that no one else aboard the <hi rend="italic">Merlin</hi> contracted this fever<lb/>
until after the last case among those who had been ashore, is evidence--<lb/>
not proof--that men staying aboard the vessel did not contract the fever<lb/>
while she was up the river. Its appearance later in such men does give<lb/>
reason for the acceptance of Lind's opinion that the disease contracted<lb/>
ashore and brought aboard, was &ldquo;infectious,&rdquo; that is, communicable.<lb/>
The attendants on the sick in the sick-bay would be most, and first,<lb/>
exposed to <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> infected therein--especially if the vessel were under<lb/>
way at sea, as those insects that left the sick-bay would most likely be<lb/>
blown outboard.</p>
<p>No clinical description of the fever is given, so the evidence for its being<lb/>
yellow fever is entirely epidemiological--its occurrence first in men who<lb/>
had been ashore, and its apparent propagation aboard ship. But while<lb/>
yellow fever is strongly indicated, the evidence is not complete. For<lb/>
one thing, we are not absolutely certain of the facts, since Lind here is<lb/>
not reporting his own observation. He does not give the source of his<lb/>
information, but as he was at that time in England, it is supposed that he<lb/>
is quoting the medical officer of the <hi rend="italic">Merlin</hi>, and presumably from an<lb/>
oral report, since no document is mentioned. Had he followed Hakluyt,<lb/>
in taking his data from the ship's log and giving dates, his report had<lb/>
been more valuable to us. Then, too, there were only four deaths, a<lb/>
<pb n="256" id="Cb000272"/>
256<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
low mortality for yellow fever if the cases were as many as are implied<lb/>
and if all were of that disease. It may be, however, that some were<lb/>
malaria. If so, they would not have been differentiated in the reports,<lb/>
for Lind, familiar with yellow fever at least from the writings of those<lb/>
who had seen it in America, was of the opinion that it was a more malig-<lb/>
nant form of malarial fever.</p>
<p>Coupled with his account of the fever on the <hi rend="italic">Merlin</hi>, Lind reports 
(p. 186) what he evidently considers the same fever on the <hi rend="italic">Weasel</hi><lb/>
and the <hi rend="italic">Hound</hi>, on the same coast the next year, 1769. For these out-<lb/>
breaks he gives no epidemiological data that are helpful, but of the cases<lb/>
on the <hi rend="italic">Weasel</hi> a full clinical report is given, quoted from the journal of<lb/>
the ship's surgeon (pp. 55-60). Of the ten deaths, four occurred on<lb/>
the eighth day, one on the tenth, and five from the eleventh to the<lb/>
fourteenth day. Since most yellow fever cases die on the seventh day,<lb/>
and the great majority not later than the eighth day, a disease in which<lb/>
one half died after ten days is excluded from consideration as such.<lb/>
Moreover, those not dying are, as a rule, out of danger--save from acci-<lb/>
dent--by the end of the fifth day, which also makes against this diag-<lb/>
nosis for the cases on the <hi rend="italic">Weasel</hi>, where very bad cases had their crises<lb/>
on the fifteenth and eighteenth days.</p>
<p>It is in this treatise that Lind makes the valuable observation, made<lb/>
earlier by Pliny and Lancisi, that malarial fevers were practically not<lb/>
contracted during the daytime. For it he quotes the following (pp. 221-<lb/>
225): In 1766 the <hi rend="italic">Phoenix</hi>, with 280 men, lay at S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; twenty-seven<lb/>
days, and the men were almost all ashore at one time or another during<lb/>
the daytime, but only sixteen stayed ashore at night--some for twelve<lb/>
nights and some, apparently, not so long. All of these contracted fever,<lb/>
of which thirteen died, the other three being left in very ill health.<lb/>
None of the others on board had the fever. The next year the same<lb/>
ship, on the coast of Guinea, lost eight out of ten men &ldquo;who had impru-<lb/>
dently remained all night on shore,&rdquo; while the rest of the ship's company,<lb/>
ashore only in the daytime, escaped. On board the <hi rend="italic">Hound</hi>, which<lb/>
accompanied the <hi rend="italic">Phoenix</hi>, there were no deaths (save one, from an ill-<lb/>
ness contracted in England), &ldquo;the officers having been particularly<lb/>
careful not to permit any of the people to continue all night on shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conclusion--for which Lind is in no wise responsible--that these<lb/>
fevers were yellow fever, led to the heresy of the safety of &ldquo;daylight<lb/>
communication&rdquo; with places infected with yellow fever, a belief, as the<lb/>
writer has said before, responsible for a large number of epidemics and<lb/>
deaths aboard ships lying off such places, whose personnel had, indeed,<lb/>
<pb n="257" id="Cb000273"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
257<lb/>
been safer had they come ashore at night than as allowed, and perfectly 
safe only had they stayed aboard.</p>
<p>SCHOTTE</p>
<p>Schotte arrived in Senegal in 1775, and in 1782 published a report<lb/>
which had been presented to the Royal Society in 1780, on the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Synochus<lb/>
Atrabiliosa</hi>&rdquo; as he had observed it there in 1778.</p>
<p>The place of the epidemic was St. Louis de Senegal. The garrison,<lb/>
he says, had been fairly healthy until early in August, when the epidemic<lb/>
began, &ldquo;raging&rdquo; from that time until about the middle of September.<lb/>
Of 92 white inhabitants at St. Louis, 59 died, the deaths occurring from<lb/>
three to five a day during the height of the epidemic, in the latter part<lb/>
of August and the first of September. A similar epidemic was said<lb/>
to have prevailed earlier in the French settlement on the island of Gor&eacute;e,<lb/>
and Schotte thinks the infection was imported thence, though there<lb/>
seems to have been but little communication between the two places.<lb/>
These epidemiological data, though scant, agree with the facts that we<lb/>
know of the fairly numerous epidemics of yellow fever that have since<lb/>
occurred in the same place, and the clinical description that Schotte<lb/>
gives (p. 41 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>) leaves no reasonable doubt as to the nature of the<lb/>
disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A constant and uninterrupted fever attended the disease, from the<lb/>
beginning to the end, in all those who died; and in some who recovered,<lb/>
no apyrexy took place before the seventh day, or later; in others sooner.&rdquo;<lb/>
The fever was . . . . &ldquo;a continued one. . . . . Most of those, who were seized<lb/>
with the disease, felt, just before it made its attack, a <hi rend="italic">languor</hi> and a giddi-<lb/>
ness of the head. This was soon followed by a <hi rend="italic">rigor</hi>, which in some was but<lb/>
slight, and in most patients did not last longer than a quarter of an hour;<lb/>
. . . . While this <hi rend="italic">rigor</hi> lasted, the muscles of the whole body, but particu-<lb/>
larly those of the face, were slightly convulsed, not unlike a trembling<lb/>
or twitching.&rdquo; The premonitory langour was not always felt. &ldquo;They<lb/>
all complained of . . . . <hi rend="italic">nausea</hi> at the stomach, and soon after threw up its<lb/>
contents, sometimes mixed with bile. Now the <hi rend="italic">rigor</hi> subsided; the body<lb/>
became hot, and the face red. The pulse grew full and quick, but rather<lb/>
soft . . . .&rdquo; In some, however, the pulse was hard, with signs of a &ldquo;peri-<lb/>
pneumony.&rdquo; &ldquo;The eyes were red and shining, and seemed to project from<lb/>
their orbits. . . . . Most patients complained of a great headache, and of a<lb/>
pain in their back, particularly about the region of the loins, and some-<lb/>
times in their arms and legs. They felt a most acute pain above and<lb/>
across their eyes. . . . . Notwithstanding the fullness of the pulse, there<lb/>
<pb n="258" id="Cb000274"/>
258<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
appeared in some a dejection and lowness of spirits, with a failure of<lb/>
strength. . . . All complained of a load, pain, and heat about the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Praecordia</hi>, but particularly about the pit of the stomach. The vomit-<lb/>
ing of yellow bile now took place, and was often repeated. This gave no<lb/>
relief to the patient, nor did the retching cease, though the stomach was<lb/>
quite evacuated, but a convulsive motion took place, and continued the<lb/>
retching, though nothing was thrown up. This caused a great thirst,<lb/>
which could not be quenched by any kind of liquid; for whatever was<lb/>
drank, was immediately rejected. . . . . Some few did not vomit, nor had<lb/>
hardly any sickness at the stomach. . . . The vomiting continued, and<lb/>
the bile, which was before thrown up of a yellow colour, and in a liquid<lb/>
state, was now changed both in colour and substance. It became green,<lb/>
brown, and at last black, and was coagulated in small lumps. A limpid<lb/>
fluid, not unlike <hi rend="italic">saliva</hi>, was ejected at the same time, in which the lumps<lb/>
of coagulated bile floated. The bile did not communicate any colour<lb/>
to this liquid, nor did it dissolve in it, but like a greasy matter swam<lb/>
mostly on its surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pulse was now not so full as before, but quicker; most patients<lb/>
complained of a burning heat within the pit of the stomach, attended<lb/>
with an unquenchable thirst. Some patients, in hopes of finding some<lb/>
relief against this internal heat and burning, stole from the beds, and laid<lb/>
down naked on the floor. Some were seized with a pain in their throat<lb/>
and a difficulty of swallowing, commonly attended with a redness on the<lb/>
outside. Those, who were afflicted with this symptom, died suddenly,<lb/>
and sooner than one would have expected from the other symptoms.<lb/>
A continual <hi rend="italic">Diarrhoea</hi>, with gripings, now took place, by which a great<lb/>
quantity of black and putrid <hi rend="italic">faeces</hi> were evacuated . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those, who survived the third or fourth day, were still afflicted with<lb/>
some new symptoms. The skin became now full of <hi rend="italic">petechiae</hi>; they made<lb/>
their first appearance about the eye-lids, and on the wrists, and soon<lb/>
after on all the other parts of the body; but the breast was generally most<lb/>
beset with them. They were mostly of a florid red colour, but some-<lb/>
times purple or livid; they appeared first like small points, and increased<lb/>
gradually into spots of about a line, or a line and a half in diameter, yet<lb/>
they were not circular, but irregular in their circumference.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;Many patients were now seized with a <hi rend="italic">coma</hi> . . . . <hi rend="italic">Vibices</hi> also ap-<lb/>
peared in different parts of the body, but commonly in such, as had been</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The <hi rend="italic">petechiae</hi> were so invariable in appearance that some, he says, had pro-<lb/>
posed to call the disease &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">morbis pulicaris</hi>,&rdquo; because the spots resembled fleabites,<lb/>
which, however, he was sure they were not.</p>
<pb n="259" id="Cb000275"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
259</p>
<p>squeezed or compressed by some means or other, wherefore, they mostly<lb/>
arose on that side or part, on which the sick lay. They appeared just a<lb/>
few minutes before death itself put an end to the horrid scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mentions the spitting of blood from the mouth, which, he says,<lb/>
&ldquo;seemed to proceed from the gums, the root of the tongue, and the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">fauces</hi>.&rdquo; He notes also the suppression of urine, the extreme restless-<lb/>
ness and, in the early stages, the sleeplessness, also the remission of pains<lb/>
as the disease progressed. Yellowness is not mentioned in his formal<lb/>
clinical history, but is noted later in his differential diagnosis.</p>
<p>His description differs from the classical one of yellow fever only in his<lb/>
statement of a prolonged convalescence and the occurrence of &ldquo;relapses.&rdquo;<lb/>
He says: (p. 64) &ldquo;The few who recovered of the disease . . . . were still<lb/>
very weak for a long time, and much subject to relapses of the same<lb/>
disease, of which (when again seized with it) they mostly died. But in<lb/>
this case they were not carried off so suddenly, as those, who died of the<lb/>
first attack. They seldom died before the eleventh day, and some not<lb/>
before the fourteenth. Neither were the symptoms so violent. They<lb/>
generally lay comatose, covered with <hi rend="italic">petechiae</hi>.&rdquo; This, however, was in a<lb/>
country where malarial infection must have been practically universal.<lb/>
A number of his cases seem, too, to have had diarrhea in the latter<lb/>
stages, and we do not know how much debility may have been due to the<lb/>
therapy employed--severe purging, emetics, and bleeding--which, how-<lb/>
ever, he abandoned later.</p>
<p>He bases his differential diagnosis from the &ldquo;bilious&rdquo; fevers of the<lb/>
books on the greater severity of the symptoms, the hemorrhages, the<lb/>
black vomit, and the <hi rend="italic">petechiae</hi>, and derives his name, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Synochus atra-<lb/>
biliosa</hi>,&rdquo; from the black vomit, as did the Spanish earlier in the New<lb/>
World, when they called it &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">v&oacute;mito prieto</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning it is not to be distinguished from the fever, which<lb/>
is called <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi>,&rdquo; (malarial intermittent) &ldquo;or from that one, which goes<lb/>
by the name of <hi rend="italic">yellow fever</hi>,&rdquo; (malarial remittent) &ldquo;but by the severity of<lb/>
its symptoms. For in those the symptoms are the same, but milder,<lb/>
and I am persuaded, that our disease only differs in malignity from those<lb/>
fevers, which I conceive to originate from the same causes, but propor-<lb/>
tionably less deleterious. In its progress it is not so difficult to be dis-<lb/>
tinguished from them; for the bilious fever has generally intermissions,<lb/>
and the yellow one slight remissions; yet sometimes it happens, that<lb/>
the first of those continues in hot countries to the third day, before it<lb/>
intermits, and that the latter has hardly any remissions on the first days.<lb/>
I also believe the bilious fever to be contagious sometimes, but I have<lb/>
<pb n="260" id="Cb000276"/>
260<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
observed the yellow fever to be much more so. The voiding of black bile<lb/>
upwards and downwards is almost the only symptom in which our<lb/>
disease differs from the yellow fever. The <hi rend="italic">petechiae</hi>, hemorrhages, and<lb/>
some other symptoms, which do not attend the bilious, are common in<lb/>
the yellow fever. But it is to be observed, that the <hi rend="italic">petechiae</hi> are less in<lb/>
number in the yellow fever, than in our disease, and in proportion as the<lb/>
skin is more yellow, the <hi rend="italic">petechiae</hi> are fewer. The skin being mostly of a<lb/>
lurid colour in the disease, I am describing, makes it differ also from<lb/>
the yellow fever. Some medical gentlemen have informed me, that the<lb/>
yellow fever was sometimes attended with the vomiting of black bile,&rdquo;<lb/>
(cases of true yellow fever probably) &ldquo;but during a residence of four<lb/>
years at Senegal, I had many opportunities of seeing patients in this<lb/>
disease, and never observed it; yet notwithstanding this I do not in<lb/>
the least doubt it, because I think the greatest affinity exists between our<lb/>
disease and the yellow fever, and I believe, as I have already said, that<lb/>
they only differ in the degree of malignity. The <hi rend="italic">diagnosis</hi> was more<lb/>
easily formed, after the disease had raged for some time. For when<lb/>
healthy and strong people, who either had been waiting on the sick, or<lb/>
visited them, were suddenly taken ill with a similarity of symptoms, it<lb/>
was easily conjectured, that they had received the disease from contagion,<lb/>
and from thence it was probable, that all those, who might be taken in<lb/>
the same manner, would labour under the same disease, and that it was<lb/>
contagious&rdquo; (pp. 65-67).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fevers rage more or less every year, but I have observed, that<lb/>
they are more or less malignant, in proportion as the weather is more or<lb/>
less rainy . . . . but when the rains are heavy and lasting, putrid fevers<lb/>
are the consequence. This remark stands confirmed by twenty years<lb/>
experience of Mr. Bishopp, surgeon to the province of Senegambia . . . .&rdquo;<lb/>
(p. 110).</p>
<p>Schotte, too, mentions (p. 131) what Labat, in Martinique, had<lb/>
stressed for the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">mal de Siam</hi>,&rdquo; and in S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; for the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bitios</hi>.&rdquo;<lb/>
&ldquo;The symptoms become gradually worse. The inflammation of the<lb/>
liver, of the stomach, and perhaps of the intestines, was changed into<lb/>
a gangrene, and this was followed by an incipient putrefaction of the<lb/>
whole body, and death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is interesting as well as rare to find that he discovered no infallible<lb/>
remedy. He is, indeed, quite definite as to the ill effects from bleeding,<lb/>
purgatives, and emetics, which he had tried at first, but speaks guardedly<lb/>
of the efficacy of the treatment which he later adopted, opium to restrain<lb/>
the vomiting, and &ldquo;the bark&rdquo; when it could be retained.</p>

<p>He was a man absolutely honest, a close and critical observer, with a<lb/>
truly scientific mind, learned, indeed, but scarcely abreast of his own<lb/>
times in his learning. His paper is full of quotations from Celsus,<lb/>
Cisalpinus, Galen, and a Latin translation of Hippocrates. If he had<lb/>
only read Towne, Bruce, Griffith Hughes of the Barbados, or Henry<lb/>
Warren of Jamaica, all of whom had published in London before this time,<lb/>
he would have known better and earlier with what he was dealing. Yet<lb/>
it may be that, had he known of these writings, he would not have left<lb/>
us his own so careful and excellent description of what he saw.</p>
<p>YELLOW FEVER, WHEN DESCRIBED IN AFRICA, NOT CONSIDERED A NEW<lb/>
DISEASE</p>
<p>In Africa, as in America, it is, naturally, the occurrence of yellow fever<lb/>
in an <hi rend="italic">epidemic</hi> that furnishes us the earliest description by which we can<lb/>
recognize this disease; but the circumstances and the identifying data<lb/>
are different in the two countries. In Yucatan and the French Antilles,<lb/>
the epidemics of 1648 are definitely recorded as the introduction of a new<lb/>
disease, hitherto unknown in those countries. In Senegal, though<lb/>
Schotte gives a distinctive name, and makes a <hi rend="italic">clinical</hi> differentiation<lb/>
between the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Synochus atrabiliosa</hi>&rdquo; and the usual fevers of the country,<lb/>
there is no indication that he considers it a disease newly introduced.<lb/>
Rather he thinks the epidemic of 1778 is an increase in prevalence and<lb/>
malignancy of fevers already present in the country, especially in 1766<lb/>
and other very wet years. This he gives on the authority of Mr.<lb/>
Bishopp, &ldquo;head of the medical establishment in the Province of Sene-<lb/>
gambia,&rdquo; and with twenty years' experience there.</p>
<p>Note, too, that in Yucatan the indigenes contracted the fever and<lb/>
died of it as readily as the Europeans--or more so--while Schotte re-<lb/>
ports nothing of the kind in Senegal. Unlike the epidemic in Yucatan,<lb/>
which is definitely recorded as the introduction of a new disease into a<lb/>
susceptible community, that in Senegal seems rather the result of intro-<lb/>
ducing a body of susceptible people into a region already infected with<lb/>
yellow fever. It is more like the epidemics in garrisons, which later<lb/>
became so common in tropical America, after yellow fever had become<lb/>
certainly endemic there.</p>
<p>OCCURRENCE OF YELLOW FEVER IN AFRICA AFTER 1778</p>
<p>After the Senegal epidemic of 1778, the next note<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> that we have of<lb/>
yellow fever on the African coast, is of its occurrence in Bulam. This is,</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">3</hi> B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud (1890, pp. 56-57) says that yellow fever was epidemic among<lb/>
the French in Senegal in 1779 as well as 1778. He gives no particulars, except</p>
<pb n="262" id="Cb000278"/>
<p>262<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>indeed, identified for us not by observations in Africa, but by the descrip-<lb/>
tions which Chisolm (1801) and others give of the infection introduced<lb/>
into Grenada, in 1793, by a ship, the <hi rend="italic">Hankey</hi>, from Bulam. In<lb/>
Grenada, and in other places in the Lesser Antilles to which it spread,<lb/>
it was recognized as being not the paludal or &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; fever of the West<lb/>
Indies, but a &ldquo;new disease,&rdquo; which, from its origin--correctly ascribed in<lb/>
this instance--was known as &ldquo;the fever of Bulam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this time to the present the reports of yellow fever in West<lb/>
Africa, from Senegal to Angola, inclusive, are frequent enough to justify<lb/>
the belief that the infection has been constantly present on the continent.<lb/>
This does not mean that the disease has been reported every year within<lb/>
this area. On the contrary, there are sometimes intervals of several<lb/>
years between successive records.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> Nor is it intended to imply that<lb/>
there has been no importation of yellow fever from America to the<lb/>
African coast within this time. This has occurred in a fair number of<lb/>
instances where the facts are known and clear, and doubtless at other<lb/>
times unrecognized. Still, yellow fever has been reported in this part of<lb/>
Africa often enough and under conditions in which importation from<lb/>
places outside this area could not reasonably be accused, to justify,<lb/>
the writer thinks, the statement that it has been <hi rend="italic">constantly</hi> present. It<lb/>
is not meant that any one place has necessarily been infected continuously<lb/>
during the whole of this time, but that there has been no time in<lb/>
which <hi rend="italic">some</hi> place was not infected. That is, the west coast of Africa,<lb/>
between the limits of Senegal and Angola, has been, the writer believes,<lb/>
a permanent regional focus ever since the disease was first recognized<lb/>
there, and, as he thinks, for a much longer time.</p>
<p>The reports of yellow fever in Africa have been of its existence at<lb/>
European settlements or aboard vessels touching at this coast. It seems<lb/>
to have been more often reported from Sierra Leone than from any other</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>that the French in Senegal suffered a heavy mortality in 1779, and gives no refer-<lb/>
ence. That the infection persisted beyond the first year is, of course, altogether<lb/>
probable.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">4</hi> B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud, in his chronological summary, which agrees in general with<lb/>
that of Hirsch (1883, vol. i, p. 334), notes no occurrence of yellow fever on the Afri-<lb/>
can mainland from 1792 until 1815, though his note of an epidemic on the island of<lb/>
Maio, in 1807, supposedly introduced from Guinea, implies a belief in its existence<lb/>
on the coast then. From 1815 to 1889, when his summary ends, he notes the re-<lb/>
corded presence of yellow fever on the mainland of Africa in 35 of the 75 years.<lb/>
His record is a careful one, and, so far as the writer knows, is the best available for<lb/>
this period; but obviously, the absence of a published report for any year does not<lb/>
imply actual freedom from the disease.</p>
<pb n="263" id="Cb000279"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
263</p>
<p>section of its size, doubtless due to the larger number of Europeans there<lb/>
and the considerable number of British merchantmen and men-o'-war<lb/>
that frequented this region and which, receiving infection there, carried<lb/>
it to a number of places in Africa, as to Gambia, Senegal, the Cape<lb/>
Verdes, Ascencion, St. Helena, and also to some ports in Great Britain,<lb/>
forming foci of infection in the African, but not in the British ports. It<lb/>
has been, I think, rarely if ever mentioned in the older records as occur-<lb/>
ing among the natives except--and then only occasionally--when asso-<lb/>
ciated with an epidemic among the whites; the general teaching having<lb/>
been that the native blacks were not susceptible to the disease.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi></p>
<p>This is by no means the same as asserting that the infection did not<lb/>
occur among the blacks in former times when it was not reported at all,<lb/>
or that, in recent times, its occurrence among them has been as rare as its<lb/>
reporting. Indeed, it must be obvious that the number of whites on this<lb/>
coast, in early times especially, has not been sufficient to prevent the<lb/>
elimination of the disease by failure of the human host if continuation<lb/>
of the infection depended upon them alone.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> The reasonable belief is<lb/>
that, during this time, the native blacks were continuously having yellow<lb/>
fever, in first one place of this region and then another, but that it simply<lb/>
was not noticed--or was rarely noticed--among them.</p>
<p>If it seems unreasonable that yellow fever could prevail generation<lb/>
after generation in the negroes of Africa, without being recognized, one<lb/>
need but recall how rare was its recognition in even the white natives of<lb/>
endemic centers in America--this, too, under medical observation<lb/>
closer by far than we have had even in recent years for the great bulk of<lb/>
the blacks of Africa. Take into account with this the racial resistance<lb/>
of the negro to yellow fever, and it is not surprising that in Africa the<lb/>
disease should almost invariably escape recognition in the black race.<lb/>
It would be surprising were it otherwise.</p>
<p>That the negro does possess a resistance to yellow fever not shown by<lb/>
any other race is, we think, among the best established facts in the epi-</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">5</hi> Some, as B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud, holding this insusceptibility dependent upon their<lb/>
remaining in the regions of their birth; others that it is effective independent of<lb/>
locality.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">6</hi> This inference is, of course, dependent upon the epidemiology of yellow fever<lb/>
in the Americas and Africa being the same. If, in Africa, some lower animal<lb/>
serves as a permanent reservoir host, the deduction would not, of necessity, hold.<lb/>
There is strong evidence against the existence of any such lower animal host in<lb/>
America, where, when the supply of susceptible men has been depleted, the disease<lb/>
has disappeared permanently or until reintroduced from without. This evidence<lb/>
against a lower animal reservoir host is lacking in Africa, though we have, indeed,<lb/>
no evidence to indicate the existence there of any host other than man.</p>

YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>demiology of the disease. It is a point on which opinion is all but unani-<lb/>
mous and evidence conclusive. Of course the negro, just as does the<lb/>
white man, acquires a <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> immunity from an attack of the disease,<lb/>
but it is certain that he has also a true racial resistance which is not<lb/>
dependent upon prior infection or exposure. This has been shown in<lb/>
many epidemics in the southern part of the United States where negroes,<lb/>
living in areas that had long been free from yellow fever, suffered much<lb/>
less severely than the whites when epidemics occurred. We have, too,<lb/>
the experience of the Kordofan half-brigade sent to Mexico in the French<lb/>
expedition of 1862, as related by Dutroulau (1868, p. 465), Cornilliac<lb/>
(1886, p. 453), Corre (1882, p. 36), and others. There had been no yellow<lb/>
fever in Kordofan in historic times, yet these troops enjoyed an &ldquo;almost<lb/>
absolute immunity,&rdquo; and suffered no deaths from that disease, while the<lb/>
rest of the expedition, similarly circumstanced, suffered severely.</p>
<p>Note, however, that what we know of the negro's reaction to yellow<lb/>
fever is that he is resistant to its <hi rend="italic">toxins</hi>. We have no knowledge that he<lb/>
is resistant to the <hi rend="italic">infection</hi>. He seems to contract yellow fever, it may<lb/>
be, as readily as do whites,<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> but to have it far less severely and with<lb/>
much less mortality.</p>
<p>Thus, although in times past yellow fever has practically never been<lb/>
reported in West Africa except when it occurred in connection with a<lb/>
white settlement, the current belief--and the one which is shared by the<lb/>
writer--is that the disease was, and is generally, propagated by the<lb/>
negroes, especially by the negro children. As reasons for its non-<lb/>
recognition in the negro we have:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) The mild and unmarked reaction characteristic of the negro.</item>
<item>(2) If it occurs chiefly in black children, the disease in them would<lb/>
be still milder and more difficult to recognize than in negro adults,<lb/>
because yellow fever tends always to be lighter in childhood--and the<lb/>
adults would be largely immunized.</item>
<item>(3) Sickness among the blacks not associated with Europeans, unless<lb/>
of a marked and severe nature, would not come to the notice of skilled<lb/>
European physicians likely to recognize the disease.</item></list>
</p>
<p>The key to the propagation of yellow fever in Africa is, then, we<lb/>
believe, that it is propagated mainly in the natives, especially in native<lb/>
children, but is noted only when susceptible whites are exposed to the<lb/>
infection. The whites, being too few to account for continued propaga-<lb/>
tion of the disease, serve as indicators of its presence among the blacks.</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> The Pasteur Commission, working in Brazil (Marchoux, Salimbeni, and<lb/>
Simond, 1903) found that <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi> fed on negroes less readily than on whites.<lb/>
Two experiments by the writer tend to confirm this, but neither, nor both, are<lb/>
sufficient to establish it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX</head>
<head>THE PLACE OF ORIGIN OF YELLOW FEVER: SUMMARY</head>
<p>The question that has been discussed throughout these pages is: What<lb/>
is the place of origin of yellow fever? This is not necessarily the place<lb/>
where the disease can first be identified by direct and positive evidence.<lb/>
Indeed, when we are first able to recognize yellow fever with certainty<lb/>
from a record of direct observation--in Yucatan in 1648--it is in a place<lb/>
where we are sure it had been introduced recently, certainly after a long<lb/>
period of freedom, and probably for the first time. To trace the origin<lb/>
of yellow fever further back than its actual recognition, we must depend<lb/>
upon evidence which is less direct--inference from what we know of its<lb/>
epidemiology and from historical records which, without necessarily<lb/>
referring directly to the disease, may imply either its presence or its<lb/>
absence. By such evidence, it should be possible to identify the region<lb/>
in which yellow fever existed earliest in the period covered by such<lb/>
historical records and archaeological data as serve to indicate to us<lb/>
approximately the climatic and sociological conditions existing in differ-<lb/>
ent parts of the world. Whether or not the place where yellow fever is<lb/>
first located within these limits of time is the same place where it first<lb/>
evolved as a disease of man, is another question. Our knowledge of the<lb/>
evolution of man and his parasites is too limited for its discussion.</p>
<p>As evidence bearing on the place of origin of yellow fever in the sense<lb/>
that has been indicated, we have given, first, a summary of its epide-<lb/>
miology--the facts that are known of its natural occurrence and its experi-<lb/>
mental production. From these data is derived the postulate: For the<lb/>
naturally continued existence of yellow fever in any place, there<lb/>
are necessary three factors, coexistent at that place: (1) the causa-<lb/>
tive organism of the disease; (2) functionally active <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi>)<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> mosquitoes; and (3) men susceptible to the infection--the<lb/>
mosquitoes having access to both the other two. Subject to the modi-<lb/>
fications that have been indicated elsewhere with respect to the possible<lb/>
agency of other mosquitoes and the possible existence of some lower<lb/>
animal host in Africa, these conditions are definitely established. Note,<lb/>
too, that while yellow fever can occur and propagate for a time wherever<lb/>
265<lb/>
<pb n="266" id="Cb000282"/>
266<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
these three factors exist even temporarily, it can continue only where all<lb/>
three factors are continuously coexistent.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>.</p>
<p>The conditions necessary for the continuous functional activity<lb/>
of the insect vector are known with some exactness; and we know in a<lb/>
general way--though much less exactly--the sociological conditions<lb/>
necessary to provide a continuous supply of susceptible men sufficient to<lb/>
keep up the infection. Hence, we need consider as possible places of<lb/>
origin of yellow fever only those regions where the indicated climatic and<lb/>
sociological conditions have existed in the time with which we are<lb/>
concerned.</p>
<p>Within the part of the world thus delimited, there are areas, comprising<lb/>
parts of East Africa and Southern Asia, where <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> are present in<lb/>
abundance and functionally active throughout the year, and where the<lb/>
supply of susceptible men is sufficient, we think, for the permanent en-<lb/>
demic maintenance of yellow fever, but in which this disease has never<lb/>
been known to be established in historic times. At present, so far as we<lb/>
know, the only factor lacking is the causative organism. In the past the<lb/>
insect vector may also have been absent. Be that as it may, yellow<lb/>
fever has not been established in these regions within historic times; and<lb/>
as our history here goes far back, and is such as would have revealed yel-<lb/>
low fever if it had been present there, we may safely exclude this territory<lb/>
as a place of origin for the disease.</p>
<p>This leaves only two regions in which climatic and sociological condi-<lb/>
tions have been suitable for the maintenance of yellow fever and in which<lb/>
it has been known to be endemic--tropical America and West Africa.<lb/>
In one or both of these regions yellow fever must have existed be-<lb/>
fore--and long before--their discovery by Europeans, and if it can be<lb/>
shown that in either one it did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> exist when the Europeans came, the<lb/>
other becomes the necessary alternative as our place of origin. In<lb/>
either country the positive evidence which we may expect to find of<lb/>
yellow fever is of its occurrence in susceptible people coming into the<lb/>
country; and the chance of recognizing the disease if it occurred will<lb/>
depend upon the conditions under which susceptibles were introduced<lb/>
and the completeness of the records which we have of their experience.<lb/>
Failing, in either country, to find positive evidence, it will be necessary</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The presence of the causative organism must be absolutely continuous: the<lb/>
other factors can be lacking for very brief periods. In the absence of functionally<lb/>
active insect vectors or susceptible men, the limit of time necessary for the elimi-<lb/>
nation of the causative organism is the time it can survive in the host it is occupy-<lb/>
ing, without transference. The maximum time is the life of an infected mosquito.</p>
<pb n="267" id="Cb000283"/>
<p>PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
267</p>
<p>to judge how much weight is to be given to this as negative evidence,<lb/>
showing absence of the disease.</p>
<p>In America, the regions that come into question are: the <hi rend="italic">tierra caliente</hi><lb/>
of Mexico, of which we may take Vera Cruz as the center; the Maya<lb/>
country in Yucatan; and the Carib country, including Hispaniola and<lb/>
other islands, and the mainland along the Isthmus of Panama. For all<lb/>
this country we have excellent European records of its discovery, its<lb/>
occupation by Europeans, and its history subsequent to occupation, and<lb/>
for some of it we have native records of a sort, covering the time both<lb/>
before and after the Conquest. The circumstances of European<lb/>
occupation--the way in which susceptible masses were introduced--<lb/>
were such that if yellow fever were already present in America it should<lb/>
have manifested itself in such way as would enable us to recognize it in<lb/>
historical records which noted epidemics and described them even<lb/>
crudely. The European and Aztec records of epidemics in Mexico, which<lb/>
were certainly not yellow fever, have been examined and discussed at<lb/>
some length, for the purpose of forming an idea of their <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> value,<lb/>
that is, the significance of their <hi rend="italic">failure</hi> to indicate epidemics of yellow<lb/>
fever earlier than we find them recorded. We think these records are<lb/>
such as would have shown the presence of yellow fever during the early<lb/>
days of the Spanish Conquest had the disease then existed in America.</p>
<p>Of the <hi rend="italic">tierra caliente</hi> of Mexico, it is found that in the early years of its<lb/>
settlement by Europeans it was certainly unhealthful, but nothing is<lb/>
found in its history which enables us to identify yellow fever. The<lb/>
tradition of devastating epidemics, requiring periodic repopulation of this<lb/>
country--the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Cocoliztle</hi>&rdquo; of Herrera--is without certain basis; more-<lb/>
over, it ascribes to the traditional disease an effect--depopulation--<lb/>
which is wholly unlike that of endemic yellow fever. As evidence against<lb/>
the existence of yellow fever here before the Conquest, we have the<lb/>
experience of the Europeans during their first invasion, and the absence<lb/>
of any note in the Aztec records. Moreover, the endemic prevalence<lb/>
of yellow fever here would imply its endemicity also in Yucatan, against<lb/>
which there is very strong evidence.</p>
<p>In the Maya country of Yucatan climatic and sociological conditions<lb/>
at the time of the Spanish Conquest, and long before, were undoubtedly<lb/>
suitable for the endemicity of yellow fever. Several Maya inscriptions<lb/>
referring to &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">xekik</hi>&rdquo; (&ldquo;blood-vomit&rdquo;), the name known to have been used<lb/>
later for yellow fever, have been regarded as evidence that the disease<lb/>
had been long familiar to these people. It is not established, however,<lb/>
that the inscriptions actually refer to any event earlier than the epidemic<lb/>
<pb n="268" id="Cb000284"/>
268<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER<lb/>
of 1648, which certainly was yellow fever, or the Mexican epidemic of<lb/>
1545, which was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yellow fever but was characterized by a &ldquo;pushing<lb/>
out&rdquo; of blood. For negative evidence in this country, we have unusu-<lb/>
ally full records of the 120 years from its occupation by the Spaniards to<lb/>
1648, and in them find no indications whatsoever of yellow fever.<lb/>
Finally, in 1648, when yellow fever did occur, recognizable with certainty,<lb/>
it was in an epidemic of a sort which had been impossible in a population<lb/>
where the disease had been endemic within a generation or more. This<lb/>
epidemic is, indeed, strong evidence of the prior freedom from infection<lb/>
not only of Yucatan, but also of the Mexican littoral toward Vera Cruz.</p>
<p>Finlay, B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud, and others have accepted as yellow fever the<lb/>
sickness and mortality which occurred at Hispaniola (Hayti) in the<lb/>
first years of its settlement, following the battle of Vega Real, in 1495.<lb/>
An examination of the contemporary accounts shows no sufficient evi-<lb/>
dence for this belief. Heavy as was the mortality, it is reasonably<lb/>
accounted for by famine and other hardships and by diseases other than<lb/>
yellow fever, especially malaria. Also, the subsequent history of His-<lb/>
paniola, especially the absence of recorded epidemics aboard ship there<lb/>
until much later, is against the early existence of yellow fever. If the<lb/>
infection was not prevalent at Hispaniola, then the claim that Spaniards<lb/>
stopping there acquired immunity and so escaped the disease at Vera<lb/>
Cruz and elsewhere on the mainland is invalid--and this is a necessary<lb/>
part of the argument for American origin.</p>
<p>The losses suffered by the expeditions of Ojeda and Nicuesa to the<lb/>
Isthmus of Panama have been attributed to yellow fever. The history<lb/>
of these expeditions, examined in detail, shows no evidence for this, and<lb/>
much against it.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">modorra</hi>&rdquo; which occurred at Darien among the men who came<lb/>
with Pedrarias Davila in 1514, is, in the circumstances of its occurrence,<lb/>
more like yellow fever than any other epidemic described in the early<lb/>
records. However, there is nothing so to identify it; its duration was<lb/>
longer than would seem consistent with yellow fever; and other causes--<lb/>
famine and malaria especially--would seem sufficient to account for the<lb/>
sickness and mortality.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; which prevailed at Guadeloupe soon after its<lb/>
settlement, in 1635, has been very generally accounted as yellow fever,<lb/>
and as having been long known to the inhabitants of the island. From<lb/>
the descriptions given it does not particularly resemble yellow fever, nor<lb/>
is there sufficient evidence that it was a disease previously known to the<lb/>
natives. That yellow fever, which visited Guadeloupe in 1648, was<lb/>
<pb n="269" id="Cb000285"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
269<lb/>
then looked upon as a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> disease and prevailed as an <hi rend="italic">epidemic</hi>, is evi-<lb/>
dence against the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>&rdquo; having been the same.</p>
<p>In Cuba, yellow fever was epidemic in 1648 or 1649, more probably the<lb/>
latter year, which implies that it was not endemic up to that time, and<lb/>
confirms other evidence of widespread epidemic prevalence in the<lb/>
Caribbean region about the time of the Yucatan epidemic.</p>
<p>Taking into view the whole of the Caribbean country--not any one<lb/>
place alone, but all of it together--considering the circumstances of<lb/>
the European invasion and settlement, and the kind of records that we<lb/>
have of it, the evidence is very strong--we think conclusive--that<lb/>
yellow fever was not endemic anywhere in this region when it was visited<lb/>
by Columbus, or for a long time thereafter. When it is identified here,<lb/>
in 1648, there had already been time enough for the introduction from<lb/>
Africa not only of the causative organism, but of its insect vector as well,<lb/>
and for the permanent implantation and wide dissemination of the lat-<lb/>
ter.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Indeed, unless <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> were lacking at first, one could not account<lb/>
for the long interval between the opening up of communications with the<lb/>
Old World and the first definitive appearance of the disease in America.</p>
<p>If the exclusion of America is certain, this, with what is known of the<lb/>
epidemiology of yellow fever, establishes West Africa as necessarily its<lb/>
place of origin. In support of this is other evidence, both historical and<lb/>
biological.</p>
<p>To say that historical evidence--except by exclusion of America--<lb/>
indicates Africa as the place of origin may be somewhat paradoxical,<lb/>
for, as we have said, the report of an epidemic that can be certainly<lb/>
identified as yellow fever comes to us 130 years earlier from America than<lb/>
a similar one does from Africa. However, conditions for the identifica-<lb/>
tion of yellow fever in early days were less favorable in Africa than in<lb/>
America. The reasons for this are: (1) The European histories of West<lb/>
Africa during the time of its discovery and settlement are far less com-<lb/>
plete than we have for America, and there are no native records whatso-<lb/>
ever. (2) The European settlements, except on the islands, were small,<lb/>
and the expeditions into the country were made by relatively small bodies</p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> It is not intended to imply that 1648 is the date of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> occurrence of yellow<lb/>
fever anywhere in America. In all probability it had occurred before that in var-<lb/>
ious places, its dissemination limited at first by the limited distribution of its<lb/>
vector. Repeated introductions into a place where the area of <hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi> infestation<lb/>
was gradually extending might cause a series of <hi rend="italic">small</hi> epidemics and eventual<lb/>
permanent establishment without any one sweeping epidemic such as occurred in<lb/>
Yucatan and Cuba.</p>
<pb n="270" id="Cb000286"/>
<p>270<lb/>
YELLOW FEVER</p>
<p>of men, so that there are few instances of susceptible people introduced<lb/>
into the country in such numbers at any one time as would probably indi-<lb/>
cate to us the existence of yellow fever, when present. (3) From our earli-<lb/>
est knowledge of West Africa, malaria has been very prevalent and very<lb/>
severe there, so that it is extremely difficult--usually impossible in the<lb/>
circumstances presented to us in early accounts--to distinguish between<lb/>
it and yellow fever. For these reasons, failure to find clear evidence of<lb/>
yellow fever in the early history of Africa has far less significance than<lb/>
a similar negative history in America.</p>
<p>Moreover, the early history of West Africa is not so thoroughly nega-<lb/>
tive as that of America. It is true that not until 1778 do we find certain<lb/>
and direct record of yellow fever in Africa, yet the sickness in Drake's<lb/>
expedition of 1585, in that of Van der Does in 1599, and of Mascarhenas<lb/>
in 1638, although not certainly showing yellow fever, are indicative of it.<lb/>
Similarly, in the history of the settlement of S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, the implications<lb/>
of the existence of a disease producing immunity on the Angola coast,<lb/>
as well as the descriptions of certain diseases occurring in S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;<lb/>
itself, are very suggestive of yellow fever. The same may be said,<lb/>
though it may be in lesser degree, of the high mortality in various com-<lb/>
mercial expeditions to Guinea. All of these occurred before--and some<lb/>
of them long before--1648, the date of the first certain yellow fever<lb/>
noted in America, and while they may not <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> indicate the presence<lb/>
of yellow fever in Africa at this time, yet, taken together, they do indicate<lb/>
it, and we have found nothing in America prior to 1648 which does so at<lb/>
all.</p>
<p>The biological evidence which indicates Africa as the place of origin<lb/>
of yellow fever is:</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>(1) The African negro contracts yellow fever, so far as we know, as<lb/>
readily as other races, but has it more mildly and rarely dies of it. His<lb/>
reaction to yellow fever is just what one would expect to have been<lb/>
evolved in a race for many generations subject to that infection. No<lb/>
other known race shows this reaction--certainly not the American<lb/>
Indian.</item>
<item>(2) Of the insect vector, <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des (Stegomyia) aegypti</hi>, it has been said in<lb/>
an earlier chapter: &ldquo;It would seem that this species, so definitely differ-<lb/>
entiated in its biology as a commensal of man, and not regarded by<lb/>
entomologists as one of the older forms, developed from some similar<lb/>
one with less sharply marked characteristics, and that, in the region<lb/>
where this took place, one would be apt to find a number of forms allied<lb/>
to it, but less completely differentiated; that is, different species of the<lb/>
<pb n="271" id="Cb000287"/>
PLACE OF ORIGIN<lb/>
271<lb/>
same subgenus and with similar, but not quite the same, life history.&rdquo;<lb/>
Now there are many species of <hi rend="italic">Stegomyia</hi> in West Africa and elsewhere<lb/>
in the Old World, some of them of biology fairly similar to that of<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">aegypti</hi>; but of such related species there are none listed in the Americas.<lb/>
That <hi rend="italic">A&euml;des (Stegomyia) aegypti</hi> at present has a wide distribution in the<lb/>
New World, is, of course, no evidence for its having originated there,<lb/>
for wherever it existed originally, it would, with the establishment of<lb/>
maritime communication, be transported eventually to all ports, and<lb/>
would become implanted wherever the requisite conditions of climate and<lb/>
breeding places were found.</item></list>
</p>
<p>The biological evidence, as regards both the insect vector and the<lb/>
human host, is, so far as it goes, altogether in favor of an Old World--<lb/>
hence African--origin of yellow fever, and this, we find, is entirely consist-<lb/>
ent with the historical evidence. If, by itself, neither kind of evidence,<lb/>
biological or historical, is altogether conclusive, we think that together<lb/>
they make a very strong argument.</p>
