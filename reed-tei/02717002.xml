<p>FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>The Outlook</p>
<p>equality with the whites, which would<lb/>
necessitate the killing of at least several<lb/>
thousand of them. It would also be an<lb/>
approval of the social equality doctrines<lb/>
of Roosevelt, whom Vardaman has made<lb/>
a leading issue in the campaign. He<lb/>
has characterized the President as a<lb/>
&ldquo;coon-flavored miscegenationist,&rdquo; and<lb/>
has otherwise abused him in language<lb/>
which for low-down vulgarity and inde-<lb/>
cency exceeds anything that ever fell<lb/>
from the lips of a public man.</p>
<p>During the last year the Whitecap<lb/>
organizations have been active in vari-<lb/>
ous portions of the State, and in the<lb/>
county adjoining this they have forced<lb/>
the merchants who own land to agree<lb/>
to neither sell nor rent to negroes.<lb/>
In the meantime the race problem is<lb/>
being complicated by changes in the<lb/>
labor situation. The negroes who do<lb/>
not own land are leaving the farms and<lb/>
flocking to the towns, where a large per<lb/>
cent. of the men live by gambling and<lb/>
stealing, or from the income of their<lb/>
wives who are employed as house serv-<lb/>
ants. In many of the towns not one-<lb/>
tenth of the negro men have regular<lb/>
employment, nor do they want it. They<lb/>
subsist in the manner mentioned above,<lb/>
or from the income of an occasional<lb/>
day's labor. It is truly a discouraging<lb/>
task to undertake to hire one for any<lb/>
purpose or for any reasonable compen-<lb/>
sation. This is especially true of the<lb/>
young generation that has grown up<lb/>
since the Civil War. Many of the<lb/>
farmers have been compelled to let their<lb/>
farms go to waste on this account.</p>
<p>JAMES WILFORD GARNER.</p>
<p>Topisaw, Pike County, Mississippi.</p>
<p>[Mr. Garner, as many of our readers<lb/>
may know, is the author of the book<lb/>
entitled &ldquo;Reconstruction in Mississippi.&rdquo;<lb/>
He is also a professor of history in<lb/>
Columbia University (New York City).--<lb/>
THE EDITORS.]</p>
<p>Serendipity Again</p>
<p>To the Editors of The Outlook:</p>
<p>Your correspondent is all wrong about<lb/>
serendipity. Why, &ldquo;seren,&rdquo; in Welsh,<lb/>
means star, and &ldquo;dip,&rdquo; in its root, means<lb/>
little, like the &ldquo;tip&rdquo; of a tail; and &ldquo;ty&rdquo;<lb/>
means house. Therefore serendipity<lb/>
means &ldquo;the star of the little house.&rdquo;<lb/>
See! If serendip has an Indian deriva-<lb/>
tion, that, of course, only goes to prove<lb/>
a family relation, that is all. R.</p>
<p>A Memorial to Major Reed</p>
<p>On August 15 a meeting was held in<lb/>
Bar Harbor of friends of the late Major<lb/>
Reed, M.D., U.S.A., to whom in a large<lb/>
degree is due the discovery of the mode<lb/>
by which yellow fever has been spread<lb/>
and the consequent suppression of that<lb/>
dire disease. Representative men were<lb/>
present from different parts of the<lb/>
country, and letters were received from<lb/>
various members of committees already<lb/>
appointed to promote the collection of<lb/>
a memorial fund in grateful commemora-<lb/>
tion of Dr. Reed's services. Important<lb/>
suggestions were presented from Presi-<lb/>
dent Eliot, Dr. W. W. Keen, Professor<lb/>
J. W. Mallet, and others. Dr. Daniel<lb/>
C. Gilman, chairman of a committee<lb/>
appointed by the American Association<lb/>
for the Advancement of Science, pre-<lb/>
sided, and Dr. Stuart Paten acted as<lb/>
Secretary. Among those who took part<lb/>
in the conference were Dr. W. H. Welch,<lb/>
of Baltimore, Dr. Janeway, of New York,<lb/>
Dr. Abbott, of Philadelphia, Dr. Herter,<lb/>
of New York, Dr. Barker, of Chicago,<lb/>
Dr. Putnam, of Buffalo, Dr. Fremont<lb/>
Smith, of Bar Harbor, and Dr. Sajous, of<lb/>
Philadelphia; and besides these medical<lb/>
gentlemen, Bishop Lawrence, of Massa-<lb/>
chusetts, and Messrs. Morris K. Jesup,<lb/>
President of the New York Chamber of<lb/>
Commerce, John S. Kennedy, President<lb/>
of the Presbyterian Hospital of New<lb/>
York, and William J. Schieffelin, of New<lb/>
York. The following conclusions were<lb/>
reached: that an effort should be made<lb/>
to raise a memorial fund of $25,000 or<lb/>
more, the income to be given to the<lb/>
widow and daughter of Dr. Reed, and<lb/>
after their decease the principal to be<lb/>
appropriated either to the promotion of<lb/>
researches in Dr. Reed's special field,<lb/>
or to the erection of a memorial in his<lb/>
honor at Washington.</p>
<p>Arrangements were made for the<lb/>
publication of circulars explaining this<lb/>
movement, and asking co-operation not<lb/>
only from the medical profession, but<lb/>
from all liberally disposed individuals<lb/>
who appreciate the value of Dr. Reed's<lb/>
services to mankind.</p>
