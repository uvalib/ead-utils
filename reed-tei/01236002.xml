<salute>Dear Doctor Fishbein:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of February 18th. reached me a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>I am so glad that you were able to work up the article on<lb/>
Father in your office and am looking forward to reading it with many<lb/>
pleasant anticipations.</p>
<p>In regard to the pictures which you desire: I have just called<lb/>
up the Library of the Public Health Service and the Librarian says<lb/>
that all pictures on Ship Island in the Library will at once be sent<lb/>
me from which to make a selection for you. I shall, of course, for-<lb/>
ward them to you the day I receive them.</p>
<p>As to a picture of myself: I am enclosing (as most appropriate)<lb/>
the only picute of Father and myself in existence. It is from a snap-<lb/>
shot, taking during the International Sanitary Conference in Jamaica<lb/>
summer before last. It has both the advantages and disadvantages of<lb/>
being an absolutely unposed picture (indeed we didn't even know the<lb/>
photograph had been taken until it appeared the next moring in &ldquo;The Gleaner.&rdquo;<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01236003"/>
The Gleaner."<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
As you can see, I had come up behind him and put my hand on his shoulder<lb/>
in order to remind him that it was time to take his digitalis etc. (see<lb/>
bottles in left hand), as I always had to &ldquo;pursue&rdquo; him after meals for this<lb/>
purpose <add>otherwise</add> <del>since</del>, with his intense interest in the work of the Conference, he<lb/>
would never have remembered it <del>himself.</del> I recall the incident well: his<lb/>
smile as he realized my presence and a whimsical remark concerning &ldquo;dutiful<lb/>
parents&rdquo; as he rose and accompanied me to take the medicine.</p>
<p>His holding his hand to his left side is not due to cardiac pain, al-<lb/>
though he had been suffering from attacks of angina pectoris since the pre-<lb/>
vious summer. It had been a characteric pose ever since he had had a coupl<lb/>
of ribs broken during the World War. He had his side strapped at once and<lb/>
continued his work without losing a day, He suffered a good deal from it,<lb/>
however.</p>
<p>By the way, <add>in addition to The History of Yellow Fever</add> I also collaborated with Father in his "Malaria Catechism<lb/>
(Pub. 1914)--see Introduction thereto--and worked with him, at $1.00 a year<lb/>
in malaria control, for the two years of the War and in the reorganization<lb/>
thereafter, up to the time of his departure for Peru. Also, of course, we<lb/>
worked together from the time of his return to the States until <del>his death.</del><lb/>
within a few hours of the beginning of his last illness. It was a glorious<lb/>
and inspiring association! Some day I hope to have the pleasure of meeting<lb/>
you and telling you more about it.</p>
<p>With very best wishes, and rest assured I shall send on the Ship Is-<lb/>
land pictures as soon as I receive them.</p>

<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
<signed>Laura Armistead Carter</signed>.
