<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your good letter of August 9th. was read with much interest.</p>
<p>I am extremely sorry about the fever at Rio. As you say, it is<lb/>
&ldquo;Another unfortunate incident to arouse interest in yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work on the bibliography of Father's book is being pushed<lb/>
harder than ever, if that be possible:--Miss Brown and I getting to<lb/>
the Library of the Surgeon General between 7 and 8 A. M. and the former<lb/>
frequently staying until 10 P. M. This latter is beyond me, although I<lb/>
frequently work at home at night. Thanks to the very welcome change <del>o</del> in<lb/>
temperature of last Saturday, one can stand these long hours with much less<lb/>
distress than heretofore. Unfortunately long hours are needed at this<lb/>
stage of the work, if you are to get the MSS according to our tentative<lb/>
schedule: This because it takes so much time to find the place of publi-<lb/>
cation of some of Father's medical references--especially those appearing<lb/>
in periodicals. Of course, its perfectly &ldquo;plain sailing&rdquo; once the right<lb/>
publication has been found. In this connection, both Mr. Neumann and Mr.<lb/>
Toepper have been most kind and helpful, while Miss Brown has been indefa-<lb/>
tigable and most ingenious in tracing obscure references to their proper<lb/>
&ldquo;locale.&rdquo; By <add>&ldquo;</add>obscure,<add>&rdquo;</add> I mean those on which we have insufficient data.</p>
<p>In the above connection, I should be very grateful if some member<lb/>
of your staff could give me more specific data on the enclosed list of<lb/>
references from Father's MSS. This would save much time, the more so as<lb/>
I believe that some of these references come from unpublished (and possi-<lb/>
bly confidential) reports, so that we might <del>lose</del> waste <add>considerable</add> time in looking<lb/>
for them in the Index Medicus etc. I have long since written personally<lb/>
to Dr. Connor and several other people, in order to get exact bibliographic<lb/>
data on references to articles, not only by themselves, but concerning other<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0322036"/>
-2-<lb/>
authors of whose publications they should be cognizant. No replies as yet,<lb/>
although I had hoped to hear long since. Is Connor in Brazil? That, of<lb/>
course, would account for my not having yet heard from him.</p>
<p>I am still expecting to go over to Baltimore in September to work<lb/>
with Dr. Frost. Hope to be able to sub-let this apartment before I leave as<lb/>
it would be a calamity to have it on my hands while working in Baltimore.<lb/>
However, the completion of the work on the book is my one and only consid-<lb/>
eration and just as soon as the bibliographic material is ready I shall<lb/>
take it to Baltimore.</p>
<p>I need not tell you under what delightful auspices Miss Brown and<lb/>
I are working at the Library of the Surgeon General of the Army nor how<lb/>
much the courtesies and facilities extended us by Colonel Ashburn and his<lb/>
staff are appreciated. The heat has been the only drawback and I hope and<lb/>
trust that it is now too late in the summer for any more such weather as<lb/>
we have suffered from in the past.</p>
<closer>
<salute>With best wishes to yourself and the work,<lb/>
Most truly yours,</salute>
