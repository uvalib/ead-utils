Dr. M. E. Connor,<lb/>
Director for Central America,<lb/>
Guatemala City.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Connor:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters from San<lb/>
Salvador dated December 22, enclosing copy of letter from Dr. Noguchi.<lb/>
I note re. obtaining sera from the convalescents and sending same to<lb/>
Dr. Muller in San Salvador. Of the two convalescents only one is<lb/>
here now - the child Adolfo Mena. The other, Luciano Gamboa, an employee<lb/>
of the lumber camp has not returned to duty as yet and no one seems to know<lb/>
where he is. As the camp will not be running to its full capacity until<lb/>
about January 12 I will check up the employees in the camp to see if he<lb/>
is there. The camp opened on January 5 (yesterday) but Gamboa did not<lb/>
report for duty. In the meantime I am going to Punta Gorda where I shall<lb/>
remain a few days and on my return try to find Gamboa again. Did you<lb/>
receive my cable to you sent to Elmendorf (there is no telegraph service)<lb/>
in code reading more or less as follows: &ldquo;Nothing new has occurred -<lb/>
of the three cases yellow fever reported one not yellow fever - other two<lb/>
considered doubtful.&rdquo; This cable was addressed to &ldquo;Intercom-Guatemala&rdquo;<lb/>
and sent on December 29. If the cable office does not have it try the<lb/>
wireless.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson received on, or about, December 26 from the I. H. B.<lb/>
the following cable - &ldquo;Examine autopsy tissues does not confirm diagnosis<lb/>
yellow fever - in fact makes it extremely doubtful - hope for additional<lb/>
information from examination sera convalescents.&rdquo; This rather confirms<lb/>
my cable to you of the 29th. I am leaving no stone unturned to prove<lb/>
clinically and epidemiologically that these cases were or were not<lb/>
yellow fever. At present all of the evidence is strongly in favor of<lb/>
their <hi>not</hi> being yellow fever. I am enclosing you another section of my<lb/>
<xref id="f01216002">report</xref> by which you will see that there is a possibility if this man<lb/>
Ricketts is at all suspicious attention will have to be directed to the<lb/>
northern part of the colony - especially around Corozal the port of entry<lb/>
from all adjacent Mexican territory to the north. You might be interested<lb/>
to know that upon my arrival here I found that Dr. Harwood still retained<lb/>
the viscera of the fatal case of yellow fever (?) and I had him send<lb/>
sections of same to Belize from which place they were sent to New York so<lb/>
that there will be a second set of tissues to examine. These last tissues<lb/>
were in formalin and not in alcohol as the first lot sent to New York. I<lb/>
have an idea that Ricketts trail may lead to a man named Ramirez from Payo<lb/>
Obispo who left here on December 13 and has not returned. It has taken<lb/>
days to find some of the men and one time it took five police over five<lb/>
days to find a man here in Stann Creek for me. As I stand at present the<lb/>
only thing that will convince me that Menas case was yellow fever is a<lb/>
positive diagnosis from New York. If I had been fortunate enough to have<lb/>
seen these cases during their illness the diagnosis might have been<lb/>
settled long ago - I say &ldquo;might&rdquo; for one can never be certain in these<lb/>
things.</p>
