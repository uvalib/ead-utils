<salute>My dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your Air Mail letter of<lb/>
Sept. 10 reached me on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>
but my letter returning your most inter-<lb/>
esting article with my comments on<lb/>
it had been mailed to you on<lb/>
the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and must have reached<lb/>
you almost immediately after<lb/>
you got off your letter- I think<lb/>
all your letter of the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> was an-<lb/>
swered in my letter and my<lb/>
comments so I have not felt that<lb/>
an answer was necessary- But<lb/>
it should have been acknowledged<lb/>
any way and has been leaning<lb/>
against my big <unclear>inkstand</unclear> ever since<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06284076"/>
C2<lb/>
B5<lb/>
2<lb/>
reminding me that I should do<lb/>
so- My reply to Dr. Hench's ques-<lb/>
tionnaire was in the form of<lb/>
a very long letter and was in<lb/>
long hand as I have no conve-<lb/>
nient way of getting hold of a<lb/>
steno-Tho. Dr. Hench has sev-<lb/>
eral times asked me to hire<lb/>
one and let him pay the bill-<lb/>
He was very Keen to see again<lb/>
my diary for the autumn of 1900<lb/>
and so I, against Cornelia's<lb/>
protest at risking it loss,<lb/>
sent him that volume by express<lb/>
with the M. S.S and my address<lb/>
at the dedication of Read's birth-<lb/>
place at Belroi in Gloucester Co. Va<lb/>
Oct. 15, 1927 which you may recollect<lb/>
contained mainly remeniscences of the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06284077"/>
3<lb/>
of the yellow fever episode-</p>
<p>I feel with you that Dr. Hench is<lb/>
so earnest and has gone to so much<lb/>
work and expense to get at all the<lb/>
facts and is besides so entirely<lb/>
disinterested in the matter- That<lb/>
we should give him all the<lb/>
help we can- I have written to<lb/>
him that your memory for details<lb/>
was better than mine and your<lb/>
contacts with the work of the board<lb/>
so much closer, so I felt that,<lb/>
where there was any difference<lb/>
in our, statements, he should take<lb/>
yours- My diary is lamentable<lb/>
scanty as I was much on the<lb/>
go with inspections and fussing<lb/>
our old <unclear>Clara Bartons</unclear> 16 orphan<lb/>
asylums that she left on my door-<lb/>
step<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06284078"/>
without any means of support or even<lb/>
any records or lists of inmates or<lb/>
employes- Also the chief Q. M. Hum-<lb/>
phies was giving us lots of trouble<lb/>
by going a head to build hospitals<lb/>
and make sanitary arrangements<lb/>
not only, without consulting the<lb/>
Medical Department, <del>and</del><add>but</add> in<lb/>
some cases against my strongest<lb/>
protests in which I was in all<lb/>
cases backed up by the chief<lb/>
Surgeon (O Reilly &amp; Havard) we acquired<lb/>
a modus vivendi with him after he<lb/>
became Q. M.General but as Chief Q<lb/>
M. of Cuba he was a pest-</p>
<p>Things move at such a pace now here<lb/>
that they take one's breath away even<lb/>
a by stander like myself- Ireland<lb/>
&amp; I were rejoicing this morning that<lb/>
AG. <unclear>Love</unclear>&amp; Wallace Dewitt should<lb/>
have been made Brig. Generals in the<lb/>
big list-</p>
<p>Affectionate regards to you and your dear wife</p>
