Mr. Frederick L. Rath, Jr., Director<lb/>
National Council for Historic Sites and Buildings<lb/>
712 Jackson Place, N.W.<lb/>
Washington 6, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Rath:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I enclose a letter and a translation thereof which I have just re-<lb/>
ceived from my friend, Senora Maria Rojas of the Finca San Jose,<lb/>
Calzada Real y Gomez Redencion, Quemados de Marianao, Havana. You<lb/>
will see that the recent revolution has disturbed her greatly and<lb/>
no wonder, as people in her situation have nothing to gain and every-<lb/>
thing to lose by national instability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tina&rdquo; Rojas has always been so modest. She speaks English quite well<lb/>
but because her companion, Lydia, speaks English practically like an<lb/>
American, Tina has always had an inferiority complex about it. There-<lb/>
fore I am not surprised that she is asking me to convey to you her in-<lb/>
vitation to visit them. Please, therefore, if you can do so, plan to<lb/>
visit them as you and I discussed. May I suggest that you keep the<lb/>
matter of the financial arrangement between you and me confidential.<lb/>
Because I think that you would be getting off to a very fine start with<lb/>
them if you were under no obligation to them. If it is necessary for<lb/>
you to visit them again (and it may well be) then perhaps we can diplo-<lb/>
matically suggest that your budget does not allow a trip at that particu-<lb/>
lar time, etc., etc., but that if they saw fit etc., etc. Keep a list of<lb/>
your expenses from Florida to Havana and I shall be glad to send you a<lb/>
check for it and shall be pleased to be allowed to consider it as a<lb/>
charitable contribution to your organization. I think that now, even<lb/>
more than before the revolution, they are anxious to have some advice.</p>
<p>Would you kindly write them at your earliest convenience so that they will<lb/>
know you are coming as they will wish to give you their full time while<lb/>
you are there and will not want to make other social engagements which<lb/>
they might have to break.</p>
<p>I think I left with you enough reprints giving you the background so that<lb/>
you will know why their finca and Camp Lazear bear such an important re-<lb/>
lationship with each other and bring in Finlay as well as Reed and the<lb/>
Americans.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
