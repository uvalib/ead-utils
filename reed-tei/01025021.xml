Mr. Lindsley Arthur,<lb/>
Malaria Field Agent,<lb/>
Georgetown County Malarial Control,<lb/>
P. O. Box 358, Georgetown, S. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am engaged on a work at present, which rarely leaves me an extra<lb/>
half hour even that I can devote to anything else and if your questions<lb/>
were not about malaria I would simply express inability to answer your<lb/>
letter.</p>
<p>1/ In the only edition of the primer I have, that revised April /18,<lb/>
I see no mention made of plants which attack the life of the adult mos-<lb/>
quito, nor do I recollect any that do so efficiently. Castor oil beans<lb/>
were supposed to have this effect, but I think it doubtful.</p>
<p>Quite a number of water plants affect the breeding of Anopheles.<lb/>
Most of them unfortunately increase breeding by the protection they give<lb/>
larvae against fish. My recollection is that I said something about<lb/>
this at the last meeting of the National Malaria Committee. If I did,<lb/>
and it is published, I will let you know how to get it.</p>
<p>Of these plants that lessen breeding the common &ldquo;duck weed,&rdquo; where<lb/>
thick enough to cover the water does this mechanically and is exten-<lb/>
sively used for this purpose in Southern Europe. There is reason to be-<lb/>
lieve that some others prevent breeding by the chemicals they exhude to<lb/>
the water: among them the &ldquo;water pepper,&rdquo; and possibly the white-flowered<lb/>
&ldquo;arrow leaf.&rdquo; I have not time to go into this. You might try the &ldquo;duck<lb/>
weed&rdquo; and note whether you find any breeding among the &ldquo;arrow leaf.&rdquo; Both<lb/>
grow in your section.</p>
<p>The latest candidates for this function are the different species of<lb/>
<hi>Chara</hi>--especially <hi>Chara foetida</hi>, which Howard, Chief of the Bureau of<lb/>
Entomology, is now investigating. I will send you in this some notes from<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01025022"/>
from<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
a foreign journal which should be of interest, and may be of use to you.<lb/>
If you can, I wish you would pass them on to Fisher.</p>
<p>You have seen Coogle's use of creosote, or rather cresol, as a re-<lb/>
pellent of adult mosquitoes. It is in a late number of the U. S. Pub-<lb/>
lic Health Reports, which I have no doubt you get. It promises to be<lb/>
valuable, especially among the negro cabins in the South.</p>
<p>2/ I profoundly doubt if there be &ldquo;numbers of people&rdquo; in the County,<lb/>
who cannot take quinine. Of something over 150,000 people in Panama, only<lb/>
three were found with idiosyncrasies to quinine, though probably over 1/2<lb/>
said they had it. Quinine immunization is a make-shift at best, only to<lb/>
be used until more efficient methods can be instituted. Quinine is best<lb/>
given in one dose per day after supper or on going to bed.</p>
<p>3/ The males of all mosquitoes feed on honey and other juices and,<lb/>
some of them at least, on pollen of flowers.</p>
<p>4/ Do not know why the Culex and Stegomyia are not carriers of the<lb/>
malaria parasites. Some species of Anopheles, as you know, do not carry<lb/>
them.</p>
<p>5/ I cannot discuss haemoglobinuric fever. It would take too much<lb/>
time: Only the same measures that control all malarial fever have, in<lb/>
other places, eliminated it also.</p>
<p>I am glad you like the malarial catechism. It is the joint product<lb/>
of my daughter and myself.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
