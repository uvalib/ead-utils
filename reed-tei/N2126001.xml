<p>THE QUESTIONS<lb/>
OF THE DAY</p>
<p>The death of Major Cart-<lb/>
wright on Sunday, of yellow<lb/>
fever, has caused a perceptible<lb/>
increase in the panicky feeling<lb/>
already apparent here and there,<lb/>
as is perfectly natural, among<lb/>
the American clerks and officers.<lb/>
It is a constant fear, accent-<lb/>
uated by reading a report, every<lb/>
day or two, of the death of one<lb/>
more American.</p>
<p>There have not been very<lb/>
many cases, proportionately,<lb/>
among Americans, but the mort-<lb/>
ality has been high. No start-<lb/>
ling, sudden spread of the fever<lb/>
has occurred, simply a steady,<lb/>
determined seeking out of at-<lb/>
tract<unclear>ive</unclear> material, an attack, and<lb/>
a funeral, or one more immune.</p>
<p>The percentage of deaths is<lb/>
very small as calculated from<lb/>
the total number of cases, but,<lb/>
of the Americans seized fully<lb/>
forty-five per cent do not re-<lb/>
cover.</p>
<p>Their companions, therefore,<lb/>
become somewhat anxious about<lb/>
there own chances, for which they<lb/>
can hardly be blamed.</p>
<p>But the fact which they must<lb/>
bear in mind, and act in ac-<lb/>
cordance with, is that the man<lb/>
who broods over the risk he is<lb/>
running, who sees danger lurk-<lb/>
ing in every glass of water or<lb/>
cup of coffee, is almost certain<lb/>
to be attacked and, in the maj-<lb/>
ority of instances, such men die.</p>
<p>Stamina, determination, cour-<lb/>
age and steady nerves mean<lb/>
much in a fight with yellow<lb/>
fever, but all of these qualities<lb/>
will be found badly impaired by<lb/>
the microbe of fear, if it is once<lb/>
allowed to enter into the thoughts.</p>
<p>Living in a constant state of<lb/>
uneasiness and terrified appre-<lb/>
hension will reduce the nervous<lb/>
system to a condition in which it<lb/>
cannot be controlled, and the<lb/>
mental agony caused wears on<lb/>
the physical organization so sev-<lb/>
erely that yellow fever is in-<lb/>
duced, and finds an easy mark.</p>
<p>Certainly, ordinary precautions<lb/>
are advisable. Chief among these<lb/>
is to turn a deaf ear to the advice<lb/>
so freely offered on every hand,<lb/>
by nearly every youngster who<lb/>
has been here two hours. They<lb/>
all land primed with instructions<lb/>
and suggestions, from people<lb/>
who, in one hundred cases out of<lb/>
ninety-five, are totally ignorant<lb/>
regarding the subject under dis-<lb/>
cussion, and who base their ad-<lb/>
vice on hearsay from equally un-<lb/>
knowing persons, or on the<lb/>
weird results evolved from their<lb/>
own imaginations.</p>
<p>Disregard all of this; throw it<lb/>
aside-and forget it; pay no atten-<lb/>
tion to the well-meaning but<lb/>
harmful rot contained in letters<lb/>
from relatives who are thousands<lb/>
of miles away and have not the<lb/>
faintest idea of what the disease<lb/>
is; forget everything that has<lb/>
ever been said by people who do<lb/>
incalculable harm when they<lb/>
assume to know all about it;<lb/>
don't sit around and discuss the<lb/>
possibility of catching the disease;<lb/>
don't listen to the stories which<lb/>
some idiots find such pleasure in<lb/>
repeating, and become morbid<lb/>
over; don't go to your room and<lb/>
imagine that you have eveey<lb/>
sympton ever discovered. Above<lb/>
all, don't adopt the measures<lb/>
which will be recommended, as<lb/>
every man has different sug-<lb/>
gestions to make, and most of<lb/>
<unclear>them</unclear> are asinine.</p>
<p>If advice is essential, consult<lb/>
a reputable physician. Don't go<lb/>
to any of the quacks or cheap<lb/>
men who are attempting to build<lb/>
a practice here on the strength of<lb/>
being American. Ascertain, first,<lb/>
before being prescribed for, if the<lb/>
Doctor has compelled with local<lb/>
laws; compel him to produce his<lb/>
documents; if he cannot do so,<lb/>
let him severely alone, as men<lb/>
who come here with diplomas<lb/>
from reliable American colleges,<lb/>
and with inquestionable evidence<lb/>
of ability and integrity, have no<lb/>
difficulty in complying with<lb/>
requirements.</p>
<p>However, consultation with a<lb/>
physician is not necessary unless<lb/>
one is really ill. Ordinary pre-<lb/>
cautions afford as thorough<lb/>
protection as can be obtained.</p>
<p>Live decently and about as<lb/>
you would at home; make no<lb/>
medical changes in your habits;<lb/>
drink all of the water you want<lb/>
-- no city has a purer supply<lb/>
than has this--don't just because<lb/>
you are away from home and<lb/>
<unclear>its influences</unclear> try to convince the<lb/>
world of your <unclear>manhood</unclear> by<lb/>
drinking as much whiskey as<lb/>
your little skin will hold, and<lb/>
keep away from Havana's house,<lb/>
of prostitution. They are dan<lb/>
gerous, and men who frequent them<lb/>
are running far greater <lb/>
risks than that of yellow fever<lb/>
alone, as any Havana physician <lb/>
can affirm.</p>
