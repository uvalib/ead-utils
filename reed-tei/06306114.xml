<salute>My dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just finished your fine memoir<lb/>
and am going to get it off in express this aft.<lb/>
I considered the suggestive of asking the S.G.O<lb/>
to get it off in a frank and by air, but it is<lb/>
difficult for me to contact them and get the<lb/>
package to them. My colored boy has gone off<lb/>
and I have no one to send it by. But they tell<lb/>
me that you will get it in 4 days. I put up to<lb/>
Ireland your suggestion to let Mrs Stark read it<lb/>
first but he turned thumbs down on that proposal<lb/>
with great emphasis, in which I agree with him.<lb/>
I do not think she can shed any light on the subject<lb/>
and if she made suggestions they might be embar-<lb/>
rassing to reject, if not useful. My diary shows that<lb/>
they left Cuba on Sept. 3, 1900 on the Rollius<lb/>
with Gen. Lee and did not return until Oct. 27<lb/>
Reed was amused by Stark but I do not think<lb/>
he could have confided in him to any extent, as<lb/>
Alex was a great talker and often an indiscrete<lb/>
one and as you see he was not there during the<lb/>
critical period and I cannot recall any<lb/>
contribution that he made. Mrs Stark shone in<lb/>
the Epidemic in June, when Major Edwards died<lb/>
She took his two children into her family and<lb/>
cared for them with her own until Mrs. Edwards re<lb/>
covered.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06306115"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
2<lb/>
my suggestions are, as you will see, all in<lb/>
small matters. Sternberg was never a Major General<lb/>
The Bureau chief in his day were Brigadiers.<lb/>
Gen O'Reilly was always proud of the fact that he<lb/>
was the first Medical Officer to become a Major<lb/>
General. Also O'Reilly did not immediately follow<lb/>
him. Old man Forward who had a fine Civil<lb/>
War record was about to retire as a Colonel and<lb/>
they made him Surgeon General for 3 months &amp; 10<lb/>
days so that he could retire as a Brigadier.<lb/>
I would suggest that you do not speak of the<lb/>
Cubans as the &ldquo;natives&rdquo;. They are a proud and<lb/>
sensitive people and there is a sort-of off-color<lb/>
suggestion about the term. I note you say the<lb/>
Post Hospital was at the south <hi>western</hi> corner of<lb/>
Columbia Bks. Should it not be south-<hi>eastern</hi>?<lb/>
Quemados was certainly <add>so-</add>east of it. I wish I<lb/>
could remember Dr. Wertenbakers given name<lb/>
If I can find it I will pass it on. I will be<lb/>
glad to see what Pinto has to say. I have<lb/>
asked Dr Hench to pass in to you several<lb/>
papers of interest that I came across in<lb/>
looking over my files for him. One bears on<lb/>
the question when Gorgas began his mosquito<lb/>
work. I do not think he began until March.<lb/>
He did not get a city ordinance imposing fines for<lb/>
breeding mosquitoes until some time in April.<lb/>
And Dr. L.O. Howard letter quotes one of Reeds<lb/>
in which he speaks of G.O. no. 6 Div. of Cuba<lb/>
I think that Ireland has written you that the S.G.O. has agreed<lb/>
to publish your Memoir as a bulletin in book form. That was a fine<lb/>
catch, your 27 pound salmon - Love to Mrs Truby if she is with<lb/>
you.</p>
