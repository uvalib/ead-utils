<salute>Dear Ma:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The most important thing to me is the <hi>date</hi>. Quaran-<lb/>
tine is passing &amp; as it was unmercifully hot in September. I<lb/>
hope that we may have a cold Oct. (especially the latter part) &amp;<lb/>
let up early. I am not so anxious for it to end as I<lb/>
was last year because I am more used to it I suppose<lb/>
&amp; because I am further from shore &amp; will be seldom<lb/>
ashore even in the winter &amp; I do hope the winter will<lb/>
be better than last winter. Certainly Laura is in<lb/>
much better health &amp; the baby is bigger. Also we have a good<lb/>
house &amp; more room: the living in two rooms was not plea-<lb/>
sant last winter.</p>
<p>The work of the summer is nearly done. I have<lb/>
about three days work for the men, &amp; then will<lb/>
be ready to go into the winter. All the windows<lb/>
have to be furnished with weights, but I hardly ex-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00713002"/>
bected that to be done before the winter.<lb/>
We were all on the island this morning<lb/>
&amp; there are many pretty places on it<lb/>
when the wind blows hard enough to<lb/>
keep the insects away &amp; quite a<lb/>
number of peculiar plants. These vines<lb/>
I have found no where else &amp; a wild pea that is very<lb/>
nearly as large as our corn-field pea.</p>
<p>We had quite a ship wreck this week. Two men were on the<lb/>
wrecked ship. Prince Lucien, ashore about 14 miles south of<lb/>
us getting off her spars, &amp; during a most tremendous wind<lb/>
she turned over. Now &ldquo;<hi>ashore</hi>&rdquo; is about a mile or 3/4 of a<lb/>
mile from the beach &amp; in 22 feet of water &amp; they were<lb/>
washed off: we had a raft &amp; on the cover of a hatch.<lb/>
They came up Friday morning &amp; we brought them<lb/>
in &amp; took care of them. One had had nothing to eat since<lb/>
<del>more</del> Monday &amp; one who washed 10 to 12 miles<lb/>
lower down the island found a green water<lb/>
melon which he ate. The children were profoundly in-<lb/>
terested &amp; looked on them as veritable heroes - although uninten-<lb/>
tional ones.</p>
<p>Besides the men on the Sloop I will have probably but one<lb/>
man ashore this winter - Barbara's husband. I had rather<lb/>
have two but however it is not a matter of great impor-<lb/>
tance. I</p>
<p>I presume that there will be pretty fair hunting here<lb/>
this winter &amp; although I have no gun I can borrow one I presume. There certainly were no<lb/>
end of ducks - although very wild last winter when I used to come out here<lb/>
I am certainly glad that the house is fixed &amp; wish it could have been done<lb/>
years ago,</p>
<p>Give my love to all at<lb/>
home &amp; in Ashland</p>

Mosquitoes to speak of<lb/>
