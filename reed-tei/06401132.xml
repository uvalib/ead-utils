<salute>My dear Truby</salute>
</opener>
<p>Love has been out of town &amp;<lb/>
I have just now got in touch with<lb/>
him, He says he will be pleased to<lb/>
review your book. I told him I<lb/>
would lend him my copy (which<lb/>
I value much on account of your<lb/>
inscription in it) but he said he<lb/>
would get a copy from <unclear>Phalsu</unclear>-<lb/>
Mrs. Walter Reed's address is Blue<lb/>
Ridge Summit- <hi>Penna</hi>- <hi>not</hi> Md. tho. it<lb/>
is only about 100 yards from the Md<lb/>
line- which by the way is the famous Mason<lb/>
and Dixon live- I feel much as you<lb/>
do about Lawrence Reed- How a man<lb/>
who makes it a rule not to answer<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06401133"/>
2<lb/>
letters got to be a Major Gen- &amp; Insp.<lb/>
Gen - is a mystery to me- I wrote<lb/>
him an important letter once &amp;<lb/>
didnt get any answer and I<lb/>
spoke to Mrs Reed, his mother,<lb/>
about it. <unclear>Ok</unclear> you must'nt <unclear>need</unclear> that<lb/>
in Lawrence she said &ldquo;he does <add>not</add> answer<lb/>
my letters either&rdquo;-</p>
<p>My Cornelia is now half through it &amp; says it is charming and<lb/>
so clear that it does not demand great learning to under<lb/>
stand it.</p>
<p>I am so pleased to get the picture<lb/>
of the two Barbaras. What a lovely<lb/>
face the mother has! The little girl<lb/>
looks as if she had been interrupted<lb/>
in some important and interesting<lb/>
preoccupation and didn't want her<lb/>
picture taken anyway-<lb/>
I am glad that you feel better about<lb/>
laura Wood and her book. She dug<lb/>
up a lot that I didnt know about-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06401134"/>
3<lb/>
Reed's early life and was very con-<lb/>
scientious to get things accurate-<lb/>
One thing I remember was the point-<lb/>
whether the confederate women had<lb/>
the use of a sewing machine, which<lb/>
I questioned. After a somewhat care-<lb/>
ful investigation in which I helped<lb/>
her we found that a few were in<lb/>
use in the towns, but that the wife of<lb/>
a methodist preacher in the country<lb/>
would have one was very doubtful-<lb/>
So she left it out- I hope you will<lb/>
give her a good word when you<lb/>
write. I sat down last week and<lb/>
devoted a day to re-reading your book<lb/>
and I am more delighted with it<lb/>
than ever- Col. Hench in a long telegram<lb/>
to me says that he and I might feel like<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06401135"/>
C2<lb/>
B5<lb/>
4<lb/>
God-fathers to it- and I am sure<lb/>
that I am proud to feel in that or<lb/>
any other relation to it- Just what<lb/>
the God-father of a book does for it,<lb/>
beyond drinking to its success<lb/>
and bragging about it, I dont know<lb/>
but I have certainly done that-<lb/>
I haven't had anything except the telegraphic<lb/>
night-letter from Hench since he got<lb/>
his copy but that was a mouthful-<lb/>
It <hi>was</hi> a pity that they left out the<lb/>
key to the frontispiece &amp; the inscription<lb/>
I think that the only thing they could do<lb/>
would be to put these on a separate<lb/>
sheet and paste it in on the copies not<lb/>
yet sent out. They could be furnished<lb/>
separately for the copies already mailed<lb/>
in any quantity as 40 for the 40 copies<lb/>
that you have ordered. I am sure that<lb/>
I would like one for my copy. It is the<lb/>
least they could do to make amends for their<lb/>
negligence. With many thanks for my copy</p>
