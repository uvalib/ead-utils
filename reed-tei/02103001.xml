</dateline><lb/>
To The<lb/>
Chief Surgeon Dept Western Cuba<lb/>
Quemados, Cuba.<lb/>
<salute>Sir;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have the honor to state in connection with enclosed report<lb/>
of cases of yellow fever that the following precautions were taken to<lb/>
prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Immediately after the appearence of the first case, that of Pvt. Walke<add>r</add><lb/>
&ldquo;I&rdquo; company, 1st U.S. Infty., the quarters occupied by &ldquo;I&rdquo; company were<lb/>
cleared of all company and individual property, including box lockers bed-<lb/>
ding, funniture, etc. and the floors were scrubbed with a solution of Bi-<lb/>
chloride of mercury and the ceilings were white washed.</p>
<p>The personal property of Pvt. Walker was removed from his company<lb/>
quarters to the Post Hospital where all clothing was soaked in a strong<lb/>
solution of bichloride of mercury and was finally returned to his compan<add>y</add><lb/>
quarters.</p>
<p>Pvt. Walker was taken sick about One o'clock in the afternoon of July<lb/>
4th. and did not go to his company quarters after he was taken ill, nor was<lb/>
he in any of the buildings of the Post Hospital during his illness.</p>
<p>About July 8th a request for a Bichloride of mercury pump was made<lb/>
to the Chief Surgeon of the Dept of Havana and Pinar del Rio and upon its<lb/>
arrival, about July 21st, it was put into immediate use.</p>
<p>The barracks occupied by &ldquo;I&rdquo; company, 1st U.S. Infty. were again cleared<lb/>
of all property and was sprayed with a solution of bichlerido of mercury<lb/>
one to five hundred (1 to 500) The wards of the Hospital and the quart<lb/>
ers occupied by these men of the Hospital Corps who had developed the<lb/>
disease were also sprayed with large quantities of bichloride solution<lb/>
one to five hundred (1 to 500) and the bed clothes, mosquito bars and the men<lb/>
clothing were placed in tubs and barrels containing a strong bichloride<lb/>
solution. As the men developed temperature they were removed<lb/>
from the hospital and placed in tents some distance from the hospital and<lb/>
as far from the other buildings as practicable.</p>
<p>The Hospital wards were finally cleared of all patients on July 24th,<lb/>
those that could be safely returned to quarters were placed in tents in<lb/>
front of and some distance from the hospital and kept there under obser-<lb/>
vation some days before they were returned to their respective company<lb/>
quarters.</p>
<p>Patients who were being treated for other than febrile diseases were<lb/>
placed in tents in the same place. The hospital office was also<lb/>
moved to one of the tents and these members of the Hospital Corps whose<lb/>
duties did not cause their coming into contact with the fever patients<lb/>
were quartered along the same line of tents.</p>
<p>The hospital wards and quarters previously refered to and all other<lb/>
portions of the Hospital proper, including kitchen and Corps squad room<lb/>
were sprayed with large quantities of bichloride of mercury solution one<lb/>
to five hundred (1 to 500).</p>
<p>The Hospital was quarentined against the Post and the Post was quar-<lb/>
entined against the town of Guanajay on the afternoon of July 22nd.</p>
<p>During the time that non-febrile patients were in quarters near the<lb/>
Hospital all communication with the hospital was practically cut off.</p>

<p>--2--</p>
<p>About July 28th. Act. Hosp. Steward Claude M Cook who occupied one of<lb/>
the tents previously refered to complained of being ill and was isolated.<lb/>
also Pvt. John E Courtney, Hosp. Corps and Pvt. Harry Vance<unclear>w</unclear> Company &ldquo;M&rdquo; 1st<lb/>
U.S. Infty. who occupied tents on this part of the field were isolated as<lb/>
soon as they developed temperature.</p>
<p>On July the Office was moved to the opposite end of the post; the<lb/>
kitchen and kitchen store room were also moved to the opposite end of<lb/>
the post.</p>
<p>On July the row of tents above refered to was knocked down and<lb/>
burned to prevent furthur spread of the disease and all propeerty contain<lb/>
in said tents was disinfected.</p>
<p>Since date of last case recorded above there has been no new case<lb/>
of the disease at this Post.</p>
