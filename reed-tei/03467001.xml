FROM GUST LAMBERT<lb/>
Mr. John J. Moran,<lb/>
Avenida Menocal 102-A,<lb/>
Havana Cuba.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Friend Moran:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Heard a brief radio preview of Yellow Jack and found that the<lb/>
authors had subordinated historical facts in favor of a cloy-<lb/>
ing - and entirely imiginary - &ldquo;love interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Mother, Son and Daughter-in-law saw the picture and their<lb/>
reaction was that the &ldquo;drahma&rdquo; seemed forced.</p>
<p>Do you remember Dr. Ames' man Friday - Gust. Lambert?<lb/>
He was the Corps man assigned, with Dr. Ames, to the yellow<lb/>
fever hospital at Columbia Barracks.</p>
<p>If Lambert meant anywhere near as much to you, when you were<lb/>
sick with yellow fever, as he did to me when I was sick, you<lb/>
will not have forgotten him. Of course I remember that<lb/>
there were two female, <unclear>immune,</unclear> practical <unclear>nurses</unclear> at the hos-<lb/>
pital but I also remember that Lambert was the REAL nurse and<lb/>
was so recognized by Dr. Ames.</p>
<p>You and I know that the success of Major Reed's experiments<lb/>
was due, in large measure, to his ability to get a sufficient<lb/>
number of volunteers to conclusively prove his theories.</p>
<p>We likewise know that, had there been two or three deaths<lb/>
among the volunteers, there would have been no more willing<lb/>
to risk their lives and Major Reed's work would have been<lb/>
halted.</p>
<p>For this reason I have fe<del>a</del>lt that there was grave injustice<lb/>
in not recognizing the work of Dr. Ames and Lambert.</p>
<p>For the last several years there have been bills in Congress<lb/>
to honor Dr. Ames and Lambert for their work. Each time<lb/>
the bills have passed the <unclear>Seante</unclear> but have been held up in the<lb/>
House.</p>
<p>Dr. Ames is dead but his widow is living. Lambert is liv-<lb/>
ing in Chicago. If you feel as I do about this will you<lb/>
make affidavit that, during your illness with experimental<lb/>
yellow fever, you were under the care of Dr. Roger Post Ames<lb/>
and that your nurse, under Dr. Ames' direction was Gust. E.<lb/>
Lambert?</p>
<pb n="2" id="f03467002"/>
<p>J. J. M. - 2.</p>
<p>FROM GUST LAMBERT</p>
<p>A few days ago a gentleman <unclear>called</unclear> me on the 'phone from Phil-<lb/>
adelphia, told me the Philadelphia Council od Spanish War<lb/>
Veterans were to present a placque to Walter Reed Hospital,<lb/>
in honor of Major Reed and asking if they could come and see me.</p>
<p>In response to my &ldquo;yes&rdquo; they appeared. Four veterans, two<lb/>
reporters from the Evening Ledger and a camerman.</p>
<p>The garbled result is the enclosure. (Parts marked out<lb/>
did not come from me.)</p>
<p>I have never sought publicity and never become involved (as in<lb/>
this instance) that I do not regret it.</p>
<p>Bye the way - I refused to let the photographer do his stuff.</p>
<p>A friend sent me a newspaper clipping:<lb/>
&ldquo;John R. Kissinger, an outstanding Spanish War<lb/>
Veteran, who won renown by submitting himself<lb/>
as a human guinea pig for yellow fever exper-<lb/>
iments would be appointed a major on the retired<lb/>
list of the Army if Congress had acted favorably<lb/>
on a bill introduced by Representative Glenn<lb/>
Griswold, of Indiana. Kissinger . . spent<lb/>
several days in Washington recently as the guest<lb/>
of Senator Frederick Van <unclear>Muye</unclear> and was feted by<lb/>
the management of Loew's Theaters in connection<lb/>
with the showing of Yellow Jack a . . Two other<lb/>
known survivors of the yellow fever experiments<lb/>
are <del><unclear>are</unclear></del> John J. Moran, now associated with the<lb/>
Sun Oil Co., in Havana and Dr. Robert Cook of<lb/>
Lexington, Va.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope that the fates are treating you kindly and that, some<lb/>
day in the not too distant future, you may be able to stop in<lb/>
and see me.</p>
<p>With kindest regards and best wishes.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>Andrus</signed>
