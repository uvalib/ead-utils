<p>THE GRAND RAPIDS HERALD.<lb/>
SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1928</p>
<p>BODIES OF DEAN AND<lb/>
COMRADES MAY REST<lb/>
IN ARLINGTON PLOT</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Gen. Pershing in Letter to Ed-<lb/>
win F. Sweet Pays Tribute<lb/>
to Hero</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>A. E. F. CHIEF CALLS HIM<lb/>
&ldquo;FIRST OF NOBLE BAND&rdquo;</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Announcement that congress is to<lb/>
act upon a proposal providing for a<lb/>
plot in Arlington National cemetery<lb/>
for the burial of Maj. Walter Reed<lb/>
and the soldier heroes of the yellow<lb/>
fever experiment in Cuba following<lb/>
the Spanish-American war, includ-<lb/>
ing Pvt. William H. Dean of Grand<lb/>
Rapids, is contained in a letter<lb/>
from Gen. John J. Pershing to Ed-<lb/>
win F. Sweet.</p>
<p>Mr. Sweet is a member of the<lb/>
committee in charge of plans for<lb/>
dedication of the Dean memorial<lb/>
bridge across the Grand river at<lb/>
Fulton st., next Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Pvt. Dean is referred to by Gen.<lb/>
Pershing as &ldquo;that simple cavalry-<lb/>
man, who was the first of the noble<lb/>
band of volunteers from the ranks<lb/>
of the American army in Cuba to<lb/>
suffer an attack of experimental<lb/>
yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of Noble Band&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am gratified to have the oppor-<lb/>
tunity to pay my tribute of respect<lb/>
to that simple cavalryman. Pvt.<lb/>
William H. Dean, Troop B, 7th<lb/>
Cavalry, who was the first of the<lb/>
noble band of volunteers from the<lb/>
ranks of the American army in<lb/>
Cuba to suffer an attack of ex-<lb/>
perimental yellow fever,&rdquo; Gen.<lb/>
Pershing writes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the XY of Maj. Walter<lb/>
Reed's Prelimniary Notes on the<lb/>
transmission of yellow fever and,<lb/>
although Dr. Carroll's attack pre-<lb/>
ceded his, it was his case that car-<lb/>
ried conviction to the minds of<lb/>
Reed and the other members of the<lb/>
yellow fever board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bill was introduced at the last<lb/>
session of congress providnig for<lb/>
a plot in the Arlington &lsquo;national<lb/>
cemetery for the burial of the sol-<lb/>
dier heroes of the fight against yel-<lb/>
low fever, and the erection of a<lb/>
fitting monument to them. The<lb/>
surgeon-general of the army has<lb/>
indorsed this proposal as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The episode of the demonstra-<lb/>
tion by the board, of which Maj.<lb/>
Walter Reed was the head, of the<lb/>
method of transmission of yellow<lb/>
fever was one of the most dramatic,<lb/>
as well as one of the most import-<lb/>
ant achievements in the history of<lb/>
medicine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The success of the investigation<lb/>
depended upon experiments upon<lb/>
human beings, as at that time no<lb/>
animal had been found which was<lb/>
susceptible to this disease, and the<lb/>
willingness with which, when these<lb/>
experiments were authorized by the<lb/>
military governor. Gen. Leonard<lb/>
Wood, American soldiers came for-<lb/>
ward and volunteered to undergo<lb/>
them, gives an unusual and striking<lb/>
character to the story of the<lb/>
achievement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benefits Inestimable&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The benefits which have flowed<lb/>
from the work of this board are<lb/>
inestimable. This continent is now<lb/>
free from a fatal and dreaded dis-<lb/>
ease which had periodically invaded<lb/>
our country for two hundred years<lb/>
before, wasting the lives and wreck-<lb/>
ing the prosperity of our southern<lb/>
states.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Trade has been released from<lb/>
costly quarantines by land and sea<lb/>
which before had tied up our com-<lb/>
merce. Cuba and our West Indian<lb/>
possessions have become safe. The<lb/>
construction of the Panama canal<lb/>
has been made possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In view of these facts, a monu-<lb/>
ment in our national cemetery to<lb/>
the man who conceived this great<lb/>
work, and to the men who aided<lb/>
in its accomplishment, seems most<lb/>
appropriate and desirable. The<lb/>
erection of this monument seems<lb/>
the more necessary because Walter<lb/>
Reed died before there had been<lb/>
sufficient demonstration of the<lb/>
magnitude of his service to the<lb/>
country for him to receive from the<lb/>
government any reward whatever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to be hoped,&rdquo; Gen. Persh-<lb/>
ing continues, &ldquo;that this monument<lb/>
will be erected, and that the mortal<lb/>
remains of William H. Dean may<lb/>
find their final resting place beneath<lb/>
it. He, also, like Walter Reid, did<lb/>
not receive any reward from his<lb/>
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PERSHING'S TRIBUTE TO MARTYR</p>
<p>JOHN J. PERSHING<lb/>
ASHINGTON</p>
<p>September 6, 1928.</p>
<p>Mr. Edwin F. Sweet,<lb/>
Kent Hills,<lb/>
Grand Rapids, Mich.</p>
<p>My dear Mr. Sweet:</p>
<p>I am gratified to have the opportunity to<lb/>
pay my tribute of respect to that simple Cavalry man,<lb/>
Private William H. Dean, Troop B, 7th Cavalry, who was<lb/>
the first of the noble band of volunteers from the ranks<lb/>
of the American Army in Cuba to suffer an attack of ex-<lb/>
perimental yellow fever. He was the XY of Major Walter<lb/>
Reed's Preliminary Note on the transmission of yellow<lb/>
fever, and, although Dr. Carroll's attack preceded his,<lb/>
it was <del>the</del><add>his</add> case that carried conviction to the minds of<lb/>
Reed and the other members of the Yellow Fever Board.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that this monument will be<lb/>
erected, and that the mortal remains of William H. Dean<lb/>
may find their final resting place beneath it. He, al-<lb/>
so, like Walter Reed, did not receive any reward from<lb/>
his country.</p>
<p>Very sincerely yours.<lb/>
John J Pershing.</p>
<p>Incl.</p>
<p>Reproduction of a portion of Gen. John J. Pershing's letter to Edwin F. Sweet, paying high tribute to <unclear>th</unclear><lb/>
courage and sacrifice of Pvt. William H. Dean.</p>
