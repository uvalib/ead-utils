Mr. Thomas J. Michie<lb/>
Koppers Building<lb/>
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Michie:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I will be glad to send you what information I have on Major Michie.<lb/>
He only had an indirect connection with Walter Reed. He was the officer in<lb/>
charge of the soldiers at Pinar del Rio in the summer of 1900 when yellow fever<lb/>
broke out there. It was not recognized as yellow fever but the doctors stupidly<lb/>
called it severe malaria. Doctor Agramonte was sent to investigate matters and<lb/>
found it was indeed yellow fever. The medical officer in charge was Captain<lb/>
Godfrey. Because of his mistake he was severely censured and some years later<lb/>
commited suicide. No blame was attached to Major Michie as this was not within<lb/>
his province. He was considered a very able officer, received continual pro-<lb/>
motions and I believe in the first world war became a general. That is about<lb/>
all I know of him.</p>
<p>May I suggest that you write further inquiries to General Jefferson<lb/>
R. Kean, 2804 <unclear>No Street</unclear> N. W., Washington, D. C. He was Walter Reed's closest<lb/>
friend in Cuba and knew Major Michie well. Ever since he told me about Major<lb/>
Michie he and I have suspected that he was a relative of the Virginia Michies.<lb/>
I shall be interested to know if this is true. If this is true and should you<lb/>
want a formal outline of his military career, I believe you can get this <unclear>merely</unclear><lb/>
by writing to the War Department and in due time they will send you an abstract<lb/>
of it. If they are too busy to do this, either one of us could find it without<lb/>
much trouble the next time we are in Washington by going to the Old Records<lb/>
Division of the Adjutant General's office in the National Archives <unclear>Building</unclear> and<lb/>
asking to see the personal file on Major Michie. Meanwhile I will look over<lb/>
the voluminous notes which I have from General Kean and see if I can find any<lb/>
more for you.</p>
<p>I am sending a carbon copy of this letter to General Kean. He has<lb/>
not been well the last month but expects to be up and around shortly and I know<lb/>
will be delighted to correspond with you. Incidentally, Mrs. Kean owns the<lb/>
<unclear>house</unclear> in which Virginia's married sister lives in Washington, just a few doors<lb/>
from where General and Mrs. Kean live.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
