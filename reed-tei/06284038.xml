Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Kean<unclear>':</unclear></salute>
</opener>
<p>At last I have been able to write down in orderly sequence<lb/>
the data I collected in Havana and since then. Permit me to send you a copy. I have<lb/>
only had <del>three</del><add>four</add> or <del>four</del><add>five</add> made, one to send to Moran, one to General Truby, one to Mrs.<lb/>
Rojas, and one to Miss Agramonte, asking each to correct any mistakes that they may<lb/>
find. I would certainly appreciate it if you will go over this and advise me of any<lb/>
corrections you wish. Please remember that I do not want you to take the troulbe to<lb/>
write your answers in long hand but if you will get the sergices of a secretary or<lb/>
public stenographer and dictate to her whatever comes to your mind, in as much detail<lb/>
as you can, I will be delighted to pay for her services. I am selfish about this as I<lb/>
know that if you do it that way, I will get more information, so please do not hesitate<lb/>
to do it.</p>
<p>The more I remember your diary, the more I am impressed by the<lb/>
fact that quoted remarks from it would make one of the best possible introductions to<lb/>
a paper, on the yellow fever work. I remember where day after day your diary spoke of<lb/>
the new yellow fever cases. I wish I had had the opportunity of spending more time on<lb/>
it, and of copying it more accurately. Would you be willing to do one or two more<lb/>
things--either mail me your diary by registered, insured mail, or express, so that I<lb/>
might spend several days on it, copy out of it only that which is sufficiently impersonal<lb/>
and yet useful to the story, submit to you what I have copied for your approval, when I<lb/>
return the diary; or would you prefer, that is if you are willing, to dictate to the<lb/>
secretary under the respective dates given in your diary, everything pertaining to your<lb/>
experience with yellow fever, including the dates and statements you made about the new<lb/>
cases coming down day after day.</p>
<p>May I ask you certain specific questions which concern the numbered<lb/>
paragraphs in my memorandum?</p>
<p>Paragraph 6: Do you know when the tent Camp Columbia was erected,<lb/>
and replaced by the wooden Columbia Barracks? What was Camp Columbia used for before<lb/>
hand? Can you tell me when Columbia Barracks was torn down in favor of the Military City?</p>
<p>Par. 8: What was the relationship and rank of Doctor Cooke, Captain<lb/>
Godfrey, and Major Michie, at Pinar? When was the exact date when Reed joined Agramonte<lb/>
at Pinar? Do you have any idea where I can obtain photographs of the post hospital at<lb/>
Columbia Barracks, in particular the officers' quarters there? The Army Museum has none.</p>
<p>Par. 10: Do you know exactly when in August, 1900, the members of<lb/>
the board called on Finlay for his larvae? I understand it was the first week. Do you<lb/>
know who visited Finlay? with Reed?</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06284039"/>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>Par. 11: Do you know on what date of the first week of August<lb/>
that Reed left Havana, and on what boat?</p>
<p>Par. 12: Between August 11 and 25, 1900, Lazear applied the<lb/>
infected mosquitos to 9 U.S. soldiers, among the Lazear himself, Carroll, and Pinto.<lb/>
The other 6 remained unidentified. Do you have any idea who they were?</p>
<p>Par. 13: I believe I told you Kissinger's version of the inoculation<lb/>
of Dean. He told me that Dean, having scoffed at the yellow fever work, had the habit of<lb/>
taking an after lunch nap in the hospital where he was a patient. Carroll, having come<lb/>
down with yellow fever that morning, Lazear and Agramonte decided to pick a volunteer at<lb/>
once. Lazear found Dean asleep, and according to Kissinger, put the mosquito on him while<lb/>
he was asleep. Later, when Dean heard why he had gotten yellow fever, presumably he was<lb/>
very angry at first, later enjoyed the experience of being a hero. This version differs<lb/>
entirely with Agramonte's version (see Scientific Monthly, Dec. 1915). Agramonte says<lb/>
Dean was passing the hospital and Lazear asked him if he would volunteer, to which Dean<lb/>
jokingly replied, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Did you ever hear the Kissinger version when you were in Cuba?<lb/>
What do you think of it? Moran knew nothing of it.</p>
<p>Par. 14: Do you know whether Lazear and Carroll made a formal<lb/>
pact not to be infected, and was it authorized by Reed? Where did Carroll do his con-<lb/>
valescing? Was he cared for in the post hospital at Columbia Barracks during his illness?</p>
<p>Par. 15 and 16: I am particularly anxious to have any information<lb/>
which you would give me as to the real story of Lazear's illness, and I <unclear>am</unclear> glad you agree<lb/>
with me that it is time to give Dr. Lazear this belated recognition. I am sure that if I<lb/>
have your approval and that of Miss Agramonte, I can also get that of Moran and Gen. Truby<lb/>
to mention this version. I will so appreciate as detailed a statement as you can give me.</p>
<p>Par. 16: Did Dr. Lazear die in the post hospital at Columbia<lb/>
Barracks? Where was he buried and when and where was the body re-interred? Where is he<lb/>
now buried?</p>
<p>Par. 17: Can you give me any information on the correspondence between<lb/>
Reed in Washington, and Carroll of Agramonte in Havana regarding Lazear's death? My<lb/>
statement in this paragraph &ldquo;much to the later annoyance of Reed&rdquo; was inserted on the<lb/>
basis of something you told me, but I forgot to find out how and when this annoyance was<lb/>
expressed.</p>
<p>Par. 19: You have been entirely too modest. General Truby tells<lb/>
me that you and Gen. Wood did more to help Reed than anybody else. Presuming that you<lb/>
do not wish to write on your help to Reed in the first person, I would appreciate it<lb/>
greatly if you would dictate as much as you can as just what your contribution to Reed<lb/>
was, and I shall be delighted to put this into my story. You will, of course, and others<lb/>
concerned, have a chance to see my story for your final corrections long before its pub-<lb/>
lication. In particular, can you give me more details on your conversation with Reed on<lb/>
your way to see Gen. Wood, and of the conference with Wood? Reed left Havana to go to<lb/>
Washington &ldquo;about the middle of October, 1900&rdquo; to tell the surgeon general about his plans<lb/>
and to give his preliminary report before the American Public Health Association in<lb/>
Indianapolis. Do you know exactly what this date was?</p>
<p>Par. 21: Reed returned to Havana &ldquo; early in November, 1900&rdquo;. Do<lb/>
you know on what date?</p>
<pb n="3" id="f06284040"/>
<p>- 3 -</p>
<p>Par. 22: Just who were the eleven soldiers who went into residence<lb/>
at Camp Lazear on Nov. 20, 1900? Who were the personnel of the camp? The official<lb/>
records do not make this clear. Do you personally know anything about the circumstances<lb/>
of the volunteering of Moran and Kissinger? Did Reed tell you anything about it? Did<lb/>
they go to Re<add>e</add>d together or separately? How was the call for volunteers put out? by<lb/>
Reed or by Dr. Ames, and in what form, by written notice or by word of mouth?</p>
<p>Par. 23: What was the exact method by which Kissinger, Moran,<lb/>
Benigno and Presedo were bitten by mosquitos between Nov. 20 and 30, 1900? Where at<lb/>
Camp Lazear did the inoculations take place, in Reed's office tent, or in the tent of<lb/>
the volunteers themselves? Who officiated and carried out these inoculations. Did<lb/>
Reed always do this? When was the building of the Infected Clothing Building begun?<lb/>
It was ready for occupancy Nov. 20.</p>
<p>Par. 27: When was the Infected Mosquito Building begun? It was<lb/>
ready for occupancy, Dec. 21. Who were the two volunteers who slept 18 nights in the<lb/>
mosquito-free side of the Infected Mosquito Building between Dec. 21, 1900 and Jan. 8, 1901</p>
<p>Par. 29: Do you know anything about the disbanding of Camp Lazear,<lb/>
and what happened to the wooden buildings? Did you yourself ever visit Camp Lazear?<lb/>
Could you see any rather hilly country from the Camp, and do you remember the relation<lb/>
of the Camp to the Rojas farmhouse, its distance and direction? When did Carroll leave<lb/>
Cuba for the U.S.? Was it in Feb. 1900 or later?</p>
<p>Par. 49: I am anxious to have your reaction to this paragraph.<lb/>
Pars. 101</p>
<p>Pars. 101-104: I am also anxious to have your reactions to these<lb/>
paragraphs.</p>
<p>Par. 109: What was the relation of Quemados to Marianao--separate<lb/>
towns or what?</p>
<p>Par. 112: You remember Reed spoke of the people who got sick in<lb/>
#102 Real St. and in #20 Gen. Lee Street. Do you know who they were? I thought you<lb/>
said that some of your friends lived in one of those houses.</p>
<p>Par. 115 and 116: I am anxious to have your opinion of this.</p>
<p>Par. 118 and 119: Please give me your opinion of these.</p>
<p>Par. 122: Please check this paragraph.</p>
<p>Par. 123: Is Major Michie alive? Would he have any information<lb/>
regarding the yellow fever work?</p>
<p>Pars. 125-126: Please check.</p>
<p>Is Dr. Ames living? Reed's letter to Carroll, Feb. 26, 1900 says<lb/>
Ames had a map of the Quemados epidemic. I would certainly like to see a map of Quemados<lb/>
of 1900. Could you send me a copy of the circular you issued October 15, 1900 and of your<lb/>
Gen. Order, No. 6, issued Dec. 21, 1900? Do you have many letters from Walter Reed? If<lb/>
there are not too many, would you let the stenographer copy them, the direct quotations fr<lb/>
letters of Survivors will do much to increase the interest of any story written on this<lb/>
work.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your magnificent help in this<lb/>
matter, and I only hope that I can do justice to those concerned.</p>
