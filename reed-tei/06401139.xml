<p>Notes and Memoranda</p>
<p>Cornelia Kean has been much interest-<lb/>
ed in reading Gen. Albert E. Truby's book<lb/>
just published by Paul B. Hoeber Inc-<lb/>
the Med. Book Dept of Harper &amp; Brothers. N. Y.<lb/>
entitled Memoir of Walter Reed- The Yellow<lb/>
Fever Episode- In talking about it and<lb/>
the courage shown by various people during<lb/>
the epidemic at Marianao in the Spring<lb/>
of 1900 I mentioned the following incident<lb/>
Major Edmunds of the Infantry who was<lb/>
then on Gen. Fitzhugh Lee's staff, he being<lb/>
the <unclear>Comd'g</unclear> Gen- Dept of Western Cuba,<lb/>
was living at 27 Gen. Lee Street (formerly<lb/>
27 Carvajal St.) where I had lived the<lb/>
year before- Mrs Edmunds and two<lb/>
young children were with him- He was<lb/>
taken sick with Yellow Fever on June 12,<lb/>
1900 and Mrs Edmunds became ill with it the<lb/>
next day- Capt. Alex. N. Stark was then the<lb/>
Post Surgeon and was living with his wife<lb/>
and two small boys Alex and Newton at<lb/>
quarters at the Post Hospital less than half a<lb/>
mile away. When he heard of the illness of<lb/>
both the Edmunds he took their two children<lb/>
into his family and cared for them until the<lb/>
recovery of Mrs Edmunds- The Major died about<lb/>
noon on June 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and we buried him at 6 p. m.<lb/>
the same day- Nothing was known of the mosqui-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06401141"/>
2<lb/>
to theory and yellow fever was believed to be<lb/>
intensely contagious and liable to be brought<lb/>
into their family by this act, the generosity<lb/>
and courage shown by the Starks is worthy of<lb/>
being placed on record- I now regret much<lb/>
that I did not call General Truby's attention<lb/>
to it when we were in correspondence about<lb/>
this fine book- But I failed to note it in<lb/>
my own diary in those hectic days- It was<lb/>
from a visit to Edmunds that undoubted-<lb/>
ly I contracted the disease. I was taken<lb/>
ill on June 21, 1900-</p>
<p>2. The conditions for the Yellow Fever Roll of Honor<lb/>
on Feb. 28, 1929 the Act of Congress creating this<lb/>
Roll on which were to be placed the men<lb/>
who volunteered to undergo the experiments<lb/>
necessary to demonstrate the conveyance of the<lb/>
disease by a certain variety of mosquito was<lb/>
approved by the President- The members of the<lb/>
Reed Yellow Fever Board were also placed<lb/>
on this Roll- To determine what men were<lb/>
entitled to be named in the Act the Committees<lb/>
of the Senate and H. R. needed reliable infor-<lb/>
mation which was furnished by the Sur-<lb/>
geon General of the Army, then Major Gen-<lb/>
eral M. W. Ireland- He called certain<lb/>
officers in conference in his office<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06401142"/>
to determine what conditions should be<lb/>
imposed to limit the member of those<lb/>
who had taken part in this work to the<lb/>
men whose act definitely contributed to<lb/>
the discovery- <add>or demonstration-</add> If those who cared for the<lb/>
sick yellow fever cases were included it<lb/>
was evident that it would be imposible<lb/>
to draw any line and this spendid<lb/>
reward would be given to doctors nurses<lb/>
and men of the Hospital Corps who had<lb/>
simply performed their duty, for which<lb/>
they were engaged- Also there were a<lb/>
number who in the earlier experiments<lb/>
offered themselves and were bitten but<lb/>
without any infection- There was no<lb/>
official list of these men, as the whole<lb/>
matter was secret on account of the<lb/>
military quarantine at Columbia<lb/>
Barracks, and few of these volunteers<lb/>
believed that they incurred any danger-<lb/>
So it was required that only experiments<lb/>
<hi>in which infection with the disease follow-<lb/>
ed</hi> should be counted<unclear>,</unclear> as these definitely<lb/>
contributed to the discovery or demonstration<lb/>
A man or woman who while nursing the<lb/>
sick became infected did not prove<lb/>
anything, that had not been known<lb/>
for many years. The men who slept in infec<lb/>
ted bedding were in quite a different<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06401143"/>
category- Not only did they take chances<lb/>
which every doctor in America would<lb/>
have told them were certain to lead to<lb/>
infection, but the repulsive conditions<lb/>
of their experiment which lasted three<lb/>
weeks instead of 3 minutes, tried<lb/>
their endurance as well as their cou-<lb/>
rage to the utmost- The contribution<lb/>
which they made to the experiment<lb/>
was the fact that they <hi>did not</hi><lb/>
become infected- I have never<lb/>
understood why Gen. Gorgas paid<lb/>
so little attention to the vast im-<lb/>
portance of these experiments-<lb/>
Altho. Circular no. 5 Hdqrs Dept of Cuba<lb/>
April 27/1901 eliminating disinfecting<lb/>
had been issued after approval by the<lb/>
Surgeon General of the Army Major<lb/>
Gorgas paid no attention to it until<lb/>
he had become converted to the<lb/>
mosquito theory, as the only way, in<lb/>
August 1901- He then wrote to Reed<lb/>
telling him that he Gorgas had as Health<lb/>
officer of Havana discontinued the<lb/>
disinfection of the personal effects of<lb/>
persons coming from a locality believe<lb/>
to be infected- The Public Health &amp; Quaran-<lb/>
tine Service were slow to accept the<lb/>
logical conclusions of Reed's demonstra-<lb/>
tions-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06401144"/>
In order to answer questions of Col<lb/>
Philip S. Hench as to the occurrences<lb/>
and movements of the persons con-<lb/>
cerned in the Y. F. Episode of 1900<lb/>
in Cuba I have looked over my<lb/>
diary to see their movements during<lb/>
the latter half of the year-</p>
<p>I was taken ill with y. f. June 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1900<lb/>
I woke in the early morning with headache<lb/>
backache &amp; fever &amp; went over to the<lb/>
hospital for examination after letting<lb/>
Gen. Lee that I was going into the hospital<lb/>
my attack was well marked with <unclear>hemorrhage</unclear><lb/>
from the gums but no albuminuria-<lb/>
I was treated in one of the Small one<lb/>
room huts south of the Playa R R-<lb/>
Captain Hepburn who was taken sick<lb/>
about the same time was in the room<lb/>
with me and was discharged at the<lb/>
same time- He had also a mild attack<lb/>
He also went north to New York on the Ward<lb/>
Line <unclear>Str</unclear> Vigilancia with me on July 3-<lb/>
We arrived N. Y. on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and having <hi>white</hi><lb/>
certificates from the P. H. &amp; M. H. Service were<lb/>
passed thru quarantine without delay<unclear>,</unclear><lb/>
The other non-immune passengers had to<lb/>
go to Hoffman's Island for 5 days<lb/>
observation in quarantine- I joined my<lb/>
family at Morristown N. J. and saw my<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06401145"/>
little son, two days old, on the afternoon<lb/>
of July 7- I was still feeling weak<lb/>
and had a conjunctivitis of my right<lb/>
eye which came on during the fever-<lb/>
A disastrous outbreak of yellow fever <unclear>occurred</unclear><lb/>
at Pinar del Rio some after I was taken<lb/>
sick and it was not promptly diag-<lb/>
nosed due to neglect of the Post Surgeon<lb/>
to follow instructions as to the clinical<lb/>
examination of blood &amp; urine in fever<lb/>
cases- It was promptly terminated<lb/>
by the old and well established pro-<lb/>
cedure of moving the troops into Camp<lb/>
only one case occurred after the move.<lb/>
I sailed from N. Y. to Havana Aug- 9<lb/>
arriving there Aug 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> at 6 P. M.<lb/>
