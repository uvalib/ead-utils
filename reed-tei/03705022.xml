<salute>My dear Hutch:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am in the last throes of finishing our Rheumatism Review. <unclear>This</unclear><lb/>
<unclear>will</unclear> take me two or three more weeks, at the end of which time I will get<lb/>
at your brief article for the Red and Black, which can be reprinted or perhaps<lb/>
used elsewhere. The movies came and are grand. I am delighted to have them.<lb/>
I also got a set of small photographs with three additional smaller copies of<lb/>
a few of them, but not of the complete set. Since I have the name of the<lb/>
local photographer who handled the matter, I will write to him directly. Not<lb/>
as a matter of pride but for personal reasons, I am sorry that he did not<lb/>
happen to take a snapshot of your giving me the degree. They sent me one of<lb/>
Doctor Clark receiving his degree. Do you happen to know whether they took<lb/>
one of us? That incident is in the movie but I must confess is rather dark<lb/>
and I do not believe any very clear still prints could be made from it. I<lb/>
think the group photograph of us is excellent and a wonderful souvenir of a<lb/>
most happy event.</p>
<p>Did <unclear>Harriet</unclear> ever receive the record of &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo; which I sent her?<lb/>
I finally got a copy of the music and I am sending it to Mary. It is really<lb/>
a lovely piece and not very difficult.</p>
<p>One thing disturbs me. I have not yet had returned to me the two<lb/>
photographs, one of Kissinger and one of Moran, which your publicity depart-<lb/>
ment used. These were personal photographs autographed to me, and I hope<lb/>
they have not been misplaced. I mentioned the matter to Miss Hough and she<lb/>
said they were probably all together in a file. I would appreciate their<lb/>
return at your convenience.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Always yours,</salute>

President of Washington and Jefferson College<lb/>
