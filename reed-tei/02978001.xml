<p>How quickly the people of the tropics drop back into<lb/>
conditions of apathy in matters of sanitation is shown<lb/>
in the case of Cuba, which supplies a striking illustration<lb/>
of the fact that the military system of sanitation em-<lb/>
ployed by the American Army in the first and second<lb/>
occupations of the island was the only thing that would<lb/>
have rid Cuba of the yellow fever and other diseases.<lb/>
As we contemplate Cuba to-day, and note its falling<lb/>
away from the high sanitary standards of the American<lb/>
Army, we may well doubt whether civil sanitary control,<lb/>
however energetic, could ever have succeeded in cleaning<lb/>
up the island, even temporarily. It was the bayonet<lb/>
behind the sanitary regulations of the military governors<lb/>
that alone did that. The ease with which a tropical<lb/>
community slips back into sloth and dirtiness is shown<lb/>
by a letter in the Boston Transcript, which says: &ldquo;When<lb/>
the American soldiery was withdrawn from the island a<lb/>
year or more ago Cuba was as clean as a whistle.<lb/>
Yellow fever had been wiped out and cholera was a<lb/>
thing of the past. Two years ago one could sit out in<lb/>
the parks or loll in the chairs in front of the hotels in<lb/>
comfort. To-day the mosquitos would eat one up. When<lb/>
the United States was in control, Cuba could give lessons<lb/>
in cleanliness to most American cities. To-day, it is<lb/>
said, one needs be guided only by the nostrils to find the<lb/>
great market in Havana.&rdquo; This relapse has come, too,<lb/>
in spite of the splendid system of national sanitation<lb/>
which was worked out in 1906 through the efforts of<lb/>
Lieut. Col. J. R. Kean, Med. Corps, U.S.A., who went<lb/>
to Cuba then at the suggestion of Mr. Taft, Secretary<lb/>
of War, under instructions to nationalize the sanitary<lb/>
service. This nationalization was effected by means of<lb/>
a decree published Aug. 27, 1907. This nationalized<lb/>
service supplied the machinery for the exercise of the<lb/>
broad powers conferred upon the old National Board of<lb/>
Health by the order of Gen. Leonard Wood. So Colonel<lb/>
Kean and his assistants succeeded in giving to Cuba a<lb/>
set of model sanitary laws, probably the best in the<lb/>
world. But neither he nor the influence of many months<lb/>
of successful operation of these laws during the second<lb/>
American intervention could give the Cubans the will<lb/>
or the ability to live up to those high standards of sani-<lb/>
tation and cleanliness. One can form an idea from this<lb/>
sanitary retrogression of the Cubans of the gigantic<lb/>
nature of the task to which the American Army set its<lb/>
hand immediately after the Spanish War.</p>
