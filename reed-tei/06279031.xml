<salute>My dear Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your recent letter gave me great<lb/>
pleasure, as it always does to hear<lb/>
from you.</p>
<p>We have had great doings here in<lb/>
the past week. In the first place there<lb/>
was a great and degrified celebration<lb/>
of the 100<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year of the Army Medical<lb/>
Library - dating it from Lovell's<lb/>
time. There were a number of dis-<lb/>
tinguished representatives from<lb/>
Governments and Medical Institutions<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06279032"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
at home and abroad. The formal oration by<lb/>
Sir Humphry Davy Rolleston, Bart.<lb/>
A fine old Chap who said many fine<lb/>
things about the Library in a <unclear>rather</unclear> in-<lb/>
distinct tone. The audience of about<lb/>
600 were distributed upstairs and down<lb/>
and most of them heard it through loud<lb/>
speakers much better than we who were<lb/>
addressed in person by Sir Humphry.<lb/>
There were very nice refreshments and<lb/>
many gallons of punch.</p>
<p>There were the usual dinners, etc.<lb/>
to which we were fortunate enough to<lb/>
be invited.</p>
<p>The other was my Decoration <unclear>with</unclear><lb/>
the Grand Cruz de la <unclear>Ordence</unclear> <add>Nacional de</add> <unclear>Mexico</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06279033"/>
Carlos Finlay. This was presented at a<lb/>
ceremony yesterday afternoon at the Cuban<lb/>
Embassy by the Secretary of Sanidad y<lb/>
Beneficenia a Cabinet Officer and likewise<lb/>
Grand Chancellor of the Order. It was a very<lb/>
pretty little ceremony and a number of our<lb/>
friends were present. The reason for my<lb/>
being so honored was that I re-organized<lb/>
the health service of Cuba in 190<del>8</del>7<lb/>
and later was able to get it consolidated<lb/>
with Beneficencia and given a place in the<lb/>
Cabinet The citation also mentioned <del>by</del> my<lb/>
friendship <unclear>for</unclear> Dr. Finlay and the fact<lb/>
that I was one of the early ones to<lb/>
recognize the value of his work.</p>
<p>I am very much gratified at this recognition<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06279034"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
by the Cuban Government and in my opinion<lb/>
the fact that the services were rendered<lb/>
so long ago increases instead of dimin-<lb/>
ishing the value of a recognition.<lb/>
I think that my correspondence with<lb/>
Dr Ramos Director de Sanidad last<lb/>
spring and our correspondence about<lb/>
it may have stirred up old memories<lb/>
in Cuba. When I got the notice of<lb/>
the Decoration <unclear>Cornelia</unclear> said at once<lb/>
&ldquo;I'll bet that General Truby's beauti<lb/>
ful letter <del>filed</del> which as you know<lb/>
was filed in the Surgeon<del>s</del> General's<lb/>
office had something to do with this.&rdquo;<lb/>
I have recently heard that they are<lb/>
going to put up a monument<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06279035"/>
5<lb/>
at Camp Lazear.</p>
<p>I haven't seen those fine girls of<lb/>
yours for a long time It would<lb/>
be a great pleasure to us if<lb/>
they would drop in on us some<lb/>
day.</p>
<p>We are happy to know that you are so<lb/>
happily and beautifully located. Our<lb/>
only regret is that you are not<lb/>
nearer us.</p>
<p>Affectionate regards from both<lb/>
of us to Mrs. Truby</p>
