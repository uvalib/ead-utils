<p>Yellow Fever in Porto Rico</p>
<p>The following briefly summarizes the history of yellow fever prior<lb/>
to the American occupation. The source (1) does not indicate from whence the<lb/>
disease came nor its mortality when here. In 1813 a report on yellow fever for<lb/>
the education of the people was made by the city council of San Juan. In 1816<lb/>
there was a severe epidemic of a disease which was thought probably to be yellow<lb/>
fever, and which affected mainly Ponce. Nothing further is found until 1865<lb/>
when it is merely mentioned that an epidemic of yellow fever existed. In 1877<lb/>
there was an epidemic affecting among other places San Juan. This lasted on into the year<lb/>
of 1878. The following table gives a summary of the deaths due to yellow fever<lb/>
from 1890-1899 with the per cent of total deaths due to that cause. Most of the<lb/>
cases are reported from San Juan, Mayaguez, and other seaport towns.</p>

<p>Dr. Pedro del Valle (2) states<lb/>
that in 1895 while he was in charge of the<lb/>
military hospital in San Juan there was a<lb/>
severe epidemic in which approximately<lb/>
out of 600 soldiers attacked 400 died.<lb/>
The cases were introduced from Cuba by<lb/>
ships sailing between Cuba and Spain. The<lb/>
disease spread gradually throughout the<lb/>
island running its course until all<lb/>
susceptibles had been attacked. It was<lb/>
gradually found that people in the coast towns were much less susceptible to<lb/>
the disease than those in the inland towns, probably because they had had an<lb/>
attack of the disease previously. It was his opinion as well as that of Drs.<lb/>
Gutierrez and Ashford that yellow fever has never been endemic here but has been<lb/>
brought in chiefly from Cuba. Dr. Juan Guiteras (3) states that yellow fever<lb/>
ceased to exist in Porto Rico after strict quarantine was enforced and ships<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0302067"/>
- 2 -<lb/>
coming from Cuba with sick soldiers aboard were prohibited from stopping at<lb/>
San Juan. Dr. Del Valle confirms this and states that previously practically<lb/>
the only steamship communication was with Cuba, Santo Domingo, and indirectly<lb/>
with Mexico. In former times the Spanish Transatlantic Steamship Co. was a<lb/>
powerful organization and when a ship of that company was quarantined at San Juan<lb/>
for yellow fever a complaint was made to the Governor. Offering the excuse that<lb/>
yellow fever was endemic here anyway the Governor would release the ship from<lb/>
quarantine and the cases would be brought ashore to introduce an epidemic. Since<lb/>
strict quarantine has been established shortly before and since the American<lb/>
occupation there have been no authentic cases of yellow fever in the island. In<lb/>
1901 (4) one case was reported from Arecibo but did not result fatally nor were<lb/>
there any further cases. (5) It was thought by the doctor who investigated the<lb/>
case that a wrong diagnosis had been made. In October and November of 1915 a<lb/>
number of cases with fever of short duration and a slight eruption appeared in<lb/>
San Juan and were diagnosed as yellow fever by the doctor in the military hospital.<lb/>
The diagnosis could not be confirmed by his associates but since he persisted in<lb/>
calling the cases yellow fever, Drs. Gorgas, Carter, and Mariano Lebredo were<lb/>
called in to investigate. They did not believe that the cases were yellow fever<lb/>
and thought that dengue was a more likely diagnosis. Other doctors reported<lb/>
numerous similar cases at that time as yellow fever but in none of them could<lb/>
the diagnosis be confirmed. Not even a suspicious case has been reported since<lb/>
then.</p>
