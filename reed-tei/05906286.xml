Mr. Frank F. Law<lb/>
John Wyeth and Brother<lb/>

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Law:</salute>
</opener>
<p>As I believe I told you, I have a yellow fever exhibit in the Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Library. The two oil sketchez of Cornwell, the final colored painting, Cornwell's<lb/>
crayon sketch of Walter Reed and many other items are exhibited. Unfortunately,<lb/>
the walls of the main room of the library are of a decorative type of plaster which<lb/>
will not permit hanging photographs. Therefore, much of the material was put in<lb/>
a display cabinet, as you will <unclear>see</unclear> by the enclosed photograph, right underneath<lb/>
the portrait of Dr. <unclear>Nill</unclear>. In this cabinet we have autographed pictures of Moran,<lb/>
and Gorgas, actual letters of Walter Reed, Carroll and others and my yellow fever<lb/>
reprint displayed in full, also three enlargements of Mr. Cornwell's--one of him on a<lb/>
ladder taking a photograph of the Finlay statue, one of a courtyard in Havana which<lb/>
served as a basis for his &ldquo;Cuban version&rdquo; and one other which he sent, also a picture<lb/>
taken at the Cleveland unveiling. I thought you would like to see these. I am<lb/>
sending a set also to Mr. Cornwell and to Mr. Kellogg. Would you mind showing yours<lb/>
to Mr. Withington? Should he wish a set I shall be glad to send it.</p>
<p>Because of the difficulty in the matter of the walls, the oil sketches<lb/>
had to be hung in a corridor in the library but this is in a very prominent place,<lb/>
as it is the corridor connecting the main room and the study rooms, through which<lb/>
all the doctors go. We have had many nice comments on the exhibit.</p>
<p>Mr. Kellogg pleased me greatly by suggesting that I might be asked to go<lb/>
as the guest of your company to the unveiling of the painting held in connection<lb/>
with some medical meeting there this Fall. I am certainly glad to accept and unless<lb/>
the war interferes will certainly <unclear>hold</unclear> this tentative date open. I will send you<lb/>
shortly a few more reprints of our article on yellow fever as it appeared in the<lb/>
Proceedings of the Staff Meetings of the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>I am taking the liberty of sending Mr. Kellogg and Mr. Cornwell each a<lb/>
copy of this letter and also a set of the snapshots.</p>
<p>My article in the Proceedings will of course be bound in all the bound<lb/>
volumes of the Clinic Proceedings but will not appear in the annual Mayo Clinic<lb/>
Volume. That Volume is a great condensation of the material which appears here<lb/>
yearly. Many excellent articles do not appear except by title. My paper on yellow<lb/>
fever will appear by title but not otherwise as Saunders likes to include only<lb/>

Mr. Frank F. Law<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>

material relating to new discoveries or to treatment. You will be interested<lb/>
to know that the circulation of the Proceedings of the Mayo Clinic Staff Meetings<lb/>
is the highest in America of the bonafide medical publications next to the Journal<lb/>
of the A.M.A. The A.M.A. circulation is <unclear>99,000</unclear>; that of our Proceedings is 20,000;<lb/>
the Medical Clinics of North America 13,000; American Journal of Obstetrics and<lb/>
Gynecology 5,200; Annals of Internal Medicine 5,000. These figures of course do not<lb/>
include the throw away or free journals. So you will see that my article will<lb/>
reach a pretty good class of medical readers.</p>

P. S. Thanks for sending me the address of Mr. Lambert. I hope to see<lb/>
him in Chicago on my way back from New York and Washington next month. You sent<lb/>
me addresses of two of Major Reed's granddaughters. I thought there was only one.<lb/>
Does Mrs. Monro live in Singapore, Malay, Straits Settlement? That is the one<lb/>
now being attacked. If so she may be in for a hell of a time.<lb/>
