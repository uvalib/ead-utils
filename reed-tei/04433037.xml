<title>Letter from A.J. Warren to Philip Showalter Hench, November 24, 1952</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Warren, of the Rockefeller Foundation, replies to Hench's inquiry about Reed's formula for the development of yellow fever. He states that Reed's fundamental conclusions are still accepted, but he does think it possible that some of Finlay's yellow fever cases may have been produced as a result of his experiments.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of November 20 to Dr. Strode is hereby acknowl-<lb/>
edged. Since Dr. Strode retired from the direction of the Inter-<lb/>
national Health Division in May, 1951 I am replying to your com-<lb/>
munication on his behalf.</p>
<p>My belief is that research work in recent years has not<lb/>
revealed any information which would tend to weaken in any way the<lb/>
fundamental conclusions of Walter Reed and his colleagues. <hi>In<lb/>
general, virus appears to circulate in the blood of humans infected<lb/>
with yellow fever for a period of about three days.</hi> In a few<lb/>
instances small amounts of virus have been encountered on the fourth<lb/>
day and I believe very occasionally on the fifth day. Probably<lb/>
there is little likelihood of mosquitoes becoming infected by biting<lb/>
a patient as late as the fifth day.</p>
<p>As far as the length of incubation in the mosquito is con-<lb/>
cerned, it appears to be directly related to the temperature at<lb/>
which the insect is maintained. If you will consult pages 240-241<lb/>
of Dr. Strode's volume on yellow fever you will find a discussion<lb/>
of this point. Under laboratory conditions incubation periods<lb/>
may be as short as four days at 37&deg;C. and be prolonged to eighteen<lb/>
days at 21&deg;C. <hi>Probably in nature eight to fourteen days would<lb/>
cover most situations</hi>.</p>
<p>I have not studied the records of Dr. Finlay's experiments<lb/>
with care but I should think it quite possible that <hi>some of the<lb/>
cases of yellow fever which he is said to have produced in volunteers<lb/>
may have been transmitted by the bite of his mosquitoes</hi>. The crux<lb/>
of the matter as I see it is that these demonstrations were not<lb/>
conclusive.</p>
