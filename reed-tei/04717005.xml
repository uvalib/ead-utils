<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The box of material came today, and the word<lb/>
surprised would not have been adequate when I saw the<lb/>
contents!</p>
<p>But don't think I'm scared. As long as I don't<lb/>
have to rush I will tackle it with interest and give all<lb/>
the time I can to it.</p>
<p>I notice that Mrs. Bruce charged an extortinate<lb/>
price for her work. My idea would be for me to type all<lb/>
the answers to your questions in carbon duplicate, num-<lb/>
bering each answer with the question number. Then, with<lb/>
my duplicate and the question sheet you said I may keep,<lb/>
there would be no necessity of an further copy for me.<lb/>
You could then have it put in corrective form in Rochester<lb/>
much cheaper than here. Of course, I will do it any way<lb/>
you wish, with the exception of tape recorder, having had<lb/>
no experience with them.</p>
<p>The only thing I regret is I see by my first<lb/>
quick reading there are going to be many blanks on these<lb/>
questions. You know that <hi>no one</hi> person concerned in the<lb/>
experiment could possibly give an answer to <hi>all</hi> those<lb/>
questions about so many people in so many places at many<lb/>
different times, but be assured I'll tell you all I know<lb/>
of my own knowledge and what I have heard directly.</p>
<p>I notice in some questions, you say, &ldquo;make a guess.&rdquo;<lb/>
In some instances, say, such as number of sick civilians<lb/>
in Pinar del Rio, I have no factual basis to make an intel-<lb/>
ligent guess. I have thought of something else, so I may as<lb/>
well make this a sort of preliminary statement so that you<lb/>
may know how I will try to answer the questions. It is in<lb/>
relation to memory. Many people besides old Samuel Johnson<lb/>
have found that human evidence is very untrustworthy.</p>
<p>As an example in my own case in relation to Y. F.<lb/>
subject: I took the phone message from Havana to tell Capt.<lb/>
Godfrey there was to be an inquiry into the suspicious num-<lb/>
ber of deaths at his hospital. As I remembered it, the voice<lb/>
said: &ldquo;This is Major Gorgas' headquarters.&rdquo; Sometime after-<lb/>
ward I knew that such a message should not have originated<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f04717006"/>
(2)<lb/>
in that office, and further learned that Capt. Stark was<lb/>
then acting in place of Surg. Gen. Western Cuba at that<lb/>
time. So I knew that my &ldquo;distinct remembrance&rdquo; was wrong,<lb/>
yet that is the way I <hi>still</hi> remember the incident!</p>
<p>Again: I wrote you once about how easy it was to<lb/>
get to Camp Lazear. At that time I was writing of Camp<lb/>
Lazear, a place I had been to but once, and rode there in<lb/>
an ambulance, but was really thinking and describing how<lb/>
to walk to the fever section across the track, and even<lb/>
then made the distance too long.</p>
<p>So, anything I say, especially on a controversial<lb/>
subject, check carefully, for while I will do my best I re-<lb/>
alize these twists of memory may still play tricks on me.<lb/>
Especially is this so, as I have to try to eliminate from<lb/>
my mind all the things I have heard and read on the same<lb/>
subject.</p>
<p>I am still not convinced that my evidence can be<lb/>
of much real value, but as you have honored me with the<lb/>
task I will carry through as if it were, and begin on it<lb/>
tomorrow. As I get batches sufficient to mail I will send<lb/>
then on to you. With best wishes,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
