<salute>My dear Doctor <unclear>Carter</unclear>:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I thank you very much for your kind letter of<lb/>
Apr. 15. I shall get together all the information I can<lb/>
in regard to the seasonal incidence of malaria types and<lb/>
see what the figures look like. Dr. Bass has promised me his records<lb/>
and Dr. Henry Thibault his. Thibault's records go back to 1907<lb/>
and ought to be of assistance in getting the curve for that region.<lb/>
Mayne, who will collaborate on the paper, will get the Memphis records<lb/>
and whatever he himself has done. I found Wenyon's explanation<lb/>
of the change in parasite types in Jl, R.A.M.C. xxxvii, 264.<lb/>
Oct. 1921. His explanation seems good, but if true why does the<lb/>
proportion of S.T. run up as usual in years when total malaria<lb/>
is much reduced? It was so in a drouthy and cinchonized year in<lb/>
Mitchell County, Ga. and Thibault has a record of a year of lessened<lb/>
malaria at Scott, when the proportion of S.T. went far above the average<lb/>
as did the resistent quartan. I acknowledge that the alternate<lb/>
theory (if there <del><unclear>is</unclear></del> are only two of them) is not without<lb/>
difficulties. If the summer heat brings out latent S.T.<lb/>
you ask the warm winds to blow tertian in spring and subtertian<lb/>
in the summer, all with the same breath! The question can be solved, I <del><unclear></unclear></del><lb/>
think, although we may not have the data sufficient to do it for<lb/>
this part of the world. <del><unclear>xxxxxxxxxxx</unclear></del> If Str&aacute;naky (Mediz. Klinik, 1918,<lb/>
xiv, 311) is correct in his figures, we have something to the point.<lb/>
1700 cases infected 1916, fall of 1916 about 90% tropica.<lb/>
Brought to malaria-free hospital May and following months, 1917.<lb/>
In June, 1917, tropica 4.5% and tert. 95.4%. In NOv. tropica, 49.8%,<lb/>
tert. 50.1%</p>
<p>I have looked up van Ezdorf's figures and we can get some data there.<lb/>
I would not accept figures from doctors, some of which he quotes.<lb/>
Percentage of <unclear>quartan</unclear> so high that you wonder whether the doctor saw<lb/>
the parasites on the slide or on the temperature chart.</p>
<p>I shall be much interested in your notes on Chara. As I told you my<lb/>
rather few observations in the field indicate that our species of Characeae<lb/>
do not inhibit larvae much. We are looking for early spring Nitella now.<lb/>
I wrote Dr. B.L. Robinson, Gray Herbarium, Cambridge, Mass. last fall about<lb/>
species of Chara, and he referred me to Charles Budd Robinson's &ldquo;Chareae<lb/>
of North America&rdquo; Bull. N.Y. Botan. Garden, iv pp 244-308. I shall try to get<lb/>
this, but perhaps would save time by having any species identified at<lb/>
some herbarium.</p>
<p>Kindly give my regards to Miss Carter. I would have called last winter,<lb/>
but, as you told me in the library, Miss Carter was then absent from the city.<lb/>
Yes, I knew Captain Butler in the P.I. and have seen him again in Washington.</p>
<p>All success to your History of Yellow Fever. This is certainly a<lb/>
great undertaking for any man at any age.</p>
<p>You will remember my asking you about cinchona cultivation,<lb/>
Christophers' and Harvey give an excellent summary of cinchona<lb/>
production in Java. Ind. Jl, Med, Res, x, 1923, p, 768. It seems that the<lb/>
plantations require high elevation (about 6,000) and prefer volcanic soil<lb/>
with heavy rainfall. After a careful examination of the map of Florida<lb/>
I conclude that these conditions are rarely round in the tropical U.S.!</p>
