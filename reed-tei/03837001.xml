FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
General A. E. Truby, U.S.A., Ret.,<lb/>
145 Laurel Street,<lb/>
San Francisco, Calif.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have your very interesting letter of November 30th and<lb/>
should have answered it two or three days ago but I have been busy<lb/>

and did not have an opportunity until yesterday morning to get<lb/>
over and talk to Kean.</p>
<p>You had better believe the little baby was at the wedding<lb/>
and I held her in my arms. She is a little dear. Ben and Barbara<lb/>
were there. The wedding was beautiful in every respect and I miss<lb/>
my guess if Lilla did not get a fine up-standing man. He looks the<lb/>
part.</p>
<p>I was very much interested in what you said about the Lazear<lb/>
book in the New York Academy of Medicine library. It is just what you<lb/>
said--the laboratory notebook about mosquitoes which Neate gave Reed.<lb/>
When Hench gets down there, I have no doubt he will dig a lot of very<lb/>
valuable information out of it. He is some boy to dig up information.</p>
<p>Now about your own manuscript: I never knew and neither did<lb/>
Kean know that the New York Academy of Medicine published books of<lb/>
any size. Of course, their circulation could be made just as big as<lb/>
they wanted to make it. Kean and I agree that, if we were in your<lb/>
place, we would not send the manuscript on to Mahlon Ashford but<lb/>
would write to him and tell him what you are doing and about the size<lb/>
of the book and ask him if his proposition of 1938 is still good in<lb/>
regard to a manuscript of the size of the one you have prepared. In<lb/>
the meantime, I am going to talk to the Surgeon General's Office and<lb/>
find out how wide a distribution they would make of the Medical Bulle-<lb/>
tin if you use that as a method of publication. I think they could make<lb/>
the distribution just as wide as they wanted to. I will let you know<lb/>
about that just as soon as I can find out. I don't see any reason why<lb/>
there should be a great hurry in getting the book published although<lb/>
as Straub used to say &ldquo;the sooner, the quicker&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, everything is in a hurry around here now and I pre-<lb/>
sume you are wearing a tin hat out in San Francisco for fear you will<lb/>
be hit by something from the air if you go out of the house.</p>
<p>With all sorts of good wishes for you and Mrs. Truby and with<lb/>
the Season's Greetings,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Faithfully yours,</salute>
