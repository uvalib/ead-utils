<p>ON CUBAN SANITATION.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Washington Government Officials<lb/>
Paying Attention to Cuban<lb/>
Board of Health.</p>
<p>(Special Correspondence.)</p>
<p>Washington, August 30.--While<lb/>
there is now less talk about the yel-<lb/>
low fever in Cuba, than existed a<lb/>
week ago, the consideration of the<lb/>
problem is receiving much atention<lb/>
and the Washington authorities feel<lb/>
almost as active an interest in it,<lb/>
perhaps as does Governor Magoon<lb/>
himself.</p>
<p>While the mosquito theory is re-<lb/>
ally no longer a theory but an ac-<lb/>
cepted <unclear>fact,</unclear> yet <unclear>where</unclear> appears to ex-<lb/>
ist in the minds of some, who are<lb/>
men of great learning in medicine,<lb/>
that the mosquito is not all there is<lb/>
responsible for the disease. While<lb/>
no other solution is presented, the<lb/>
belief appears to be strong that the<lb/>
first cause of the disease has not<lb/>
yet been discovered.</p>
<p>With the nationalizing of the<lb/>
Board of Health of Cuba, it is likely<lb/>
that a closed study will be made of<lb/>
the disease, and the causes of the re-<lb/>
cent outbreak of the disease may be<lb/>
explained. If the mosquito is res-<lb/>
ponsible, how is it then, that the<lb/>
Island could have been so free of it<lb/>
and then have it break out as it did.<lb/>
Surely the mosquito cannot be blam-<lb/>
ed for the transmission of the disease<lb/>
after so long a time had elapsed since<lb/>
the prvious cases, unless they can<lb/>
transmit the germs to their poster-<lb/>
ity unto the third and fourth genera-<lb/>
tion, or even to more remote<lb/>
branches.</p>
<p>If it is not proven that during the<lb/>
interval there was yellow fever, per-<lb/>
haps of a milder type, at these places<lb/>
where it developed after more than<lb/>
six months had elapsed since the pre-<lb/>
viously known case, then it will be<lb/>
plain that there are other influences<lb/>
than the mosquito which tend to con-<lb/>
tinue the disease. The explanation<lb/>
given that there undoubtedly existed<lb/>
cases in those small towns in Ma-<lb/>
tanzas province which were never re-<lb/>
ported as such, is quite likely to be<lb/>
true. The known objection of any<lb/>
people not used to sanitation, or to<lb/>
the exercise of the more advanced<lb/>
hygienic precautions, an objection<lb/>
which the Cubans have exhibited to<lb/>
a marked degree, not only in this in-<lb/>
tervention, but in the first interven-<lb/>
tion. On both occasions they have<lb/>
scornfully shown their condemna-<lb/>
tion of sanitation both in their re-<lb/>
signed manner of submitting to it,<lb/>
and their indifference to the work;<lb/>
and there have been some who have<lb/>
been frank enough to say that it<lb/>
was all foolishness and did not<lb/>
amount to anything. Some of them<lb/>
have taken the matter very sorely,<lb/>
but those who are said to have been<lb/>
sorest, are the Spanish element of<lb/>
the population.</p>
<p>This easily explained, because the<lb/>
Cubans have always been under the<lb/>
Spanish regime and have had to sub-<lb/>
mit to their dictates. They have<lb/>
learned, through successive genera-<lb/>
tions, the lesson of bowing or at<lb/>
least appearing to bow to the gov-<lb/>
ernment of the island. The Span-<lb/>
iard, on the other hand, after so<lb/>
long a reign do not relish having to<lb/>
take orders, particularly when they<lb/>
regard them as a useless display of<lb/>
authority.</p>
<p>It is thought that with the ques-<lb/>
tion of health in the hands of Major<lb/>
Kean yellow fever will have a closer<lb/>
scrutiny than it has ever had before<lb/>
because he will have first hand data<lb/>
from all of the Cuban towns, can or-<lb/>
der any investigation he chooses,<lb/>
and can have the power to do just a<lb/>
he pleases in carrying on his studies.<lb/>
It is a splendid opportunity for a<lb/>
comparatively young physician, <unclear>and</unclear><lb/>
there is no doubt that he will avail<lb/>
himself of it. What is of great in-<lb/>
terest is the exact origin of the <unclear>dis-<lb/>
ease</unclear>. What gives it its first <unclear>start?</unclear><lb/>
Surely not the mosquito, and if he<lb/>
does, where does he get it?</p>
<p>It is plain to many that we <unclear>either</unclear><lb/>
do not know the habits of the mos-<lb/>
quito, or a great injustice is being<lb/>
done that insect by imposing upon it<lb/>
the full culpablity of propagating<lb/>
the disease. The cause is believed<lb/>
to <unclear>lie</unclear> in certain bad sanitary <unclear>condi-</unclear><lb/>
tions, which reduce the water in<lb/>
which the mosquitoes are hatched to<lb/>
a peculiar condition, which start<lb/>
them out charged with serum, some<lb/>
having it probably in a greater or<lb/>
lesser degree.</p>
<p>Let us take, for instance the good<lb/>
work being done on the Isthmus of<lb/>
Panama, by the American sanitary<lb/>
officers in that zone. They have<lb/>
relegated yellow fever to the rear<lb/>
at least they have that accomplish-<lb/>
ment to their credit just now. It<lb/>
is true that the work they have done<lb/>
there has been phenomenal and has<lb/>
cost an immense amount of money,<lb/>
but they have made the place healthy<lb/>
and wonderfully so, if one goes<lb/>
back to the days <unclear>when</unclear> the French<lb/>
were working on the canal.</p>
<p>Not counting any of the native<lb/>
population, simply those <unclear>Americans</unclear><lb/>
and natives employed by the Amer-<lb/>
ican government in the work on the<lb/>
canal, there are <unclear>38,000 souls</unclear>. During<lb/>
the month of last July, there were<lb/>
only 1,097 cases of sickness, while<lb/>
during the month of July, 1906, with<lb/>
28,000 workmen there were 1,107,<lb/>
cases of sickness. For July, 1907,<lb/>
the percentage of deaths among the<lb/>
white employees, was 16, while<lb/>
among the colored employees it was<lb/>
42. For the month of July, 1906,<lb/>
however, the death rate for the<lb/>
whites was 30, and for the colored<lb/>
72.</p>
<p>This data is interesting, because<lb/>
recent figures in this city give the<lb/>
death rate of the whites at 16.9 and<lb/>
the colored death rate at 23.8. The<lb/>
death rate at Havana is probably a<lb/>
little greater than that of this city.</p>
<p>For more than twenty months<lb/>
there has not been a case of yellow<lb/>
fever at Panama, the last occurring<lb/>
there in November, 1905. The last<lb/>
case of yellow fever on the Isth-<lb/>
mus was in May, 1906, fifteen<lb/>
months ago. During July, only four<lb/>
Americans, white, employed by the<lb/>
Canal Commission, died and two of<lb/>
them were accidentally drowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;NOTE FOR THE PRESS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Taft Denies He Said Last Cabinet<lb/>
Was Dishonest--Nobody Says<lb/>
That He Said It.</p>
<p>The following statement for the<lb/>
press was issued from the Palace<lb/>
this morning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washington dispatches recently<lb/>
published in Havana asserted that<lb/>
the American government had proof<lb/>
that the members of the late cabinet<lb/>
of President Palma were defaulters<lb/>
and guilty of dishonest practices dur-<lb/>
ing the revolution of 1906. These<lb/>
statements came to the attention of<lb/>
Secretary Taft, and, thereupon, he<lb/>
cabled Governor Magoon as fol-<lb/>
lows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The statement that the Ameri-<lb/>
can government has proof that cab-<lb/>
inet officers and President Palma<lb/>
were defaulters or dishonest during<lb/>
the revolution of 1906 is entirely un-<lb/>
founded. No evidence of this kind<lb/>
has ever been brought to my at-<lb/>
<unclear>tention</unclear>, nor have I any reason to<lb/>
suppose that the members of Presi-<lb/>
dent Palma's cabinet were <unclear>defaultors</unclear><lb/>
or dishonest. You can make this<lb/>
statement <unclear>wthout</unclear> qualification, <unclear>and</unclear><lb/>
give it publication.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above statement was no <unclear>doubt</unclear><lb/>
called forth by correspondence which<lb/>
recently appeared in The <unclear>Lucna,</unclear><lb/>
from its Washington correspondence.<lb/>
In this correspondence there was no<lb/>
charge made against the honesty or<lb/>
square dealings of any member of<lb/>
President Palma's cabinet during<lb/>
the revolution of 1906. No direct<lb/>
charge was made that President Pal-<lb/>
ma was dishonest. But it will be<lb/>
noticed that Secretary Taft does not<lb/>
follow the correspondent's statement<lb/>
that &ldquo;a late official&rdquo; of the Cuban<lb/>
government was charged with queer<lb/>
practices, and that it was put up to<lb/>
him in pretty strong terms. The<lb/>
Lucha is afraid that Secretary Taft<lb/>
was not first shown the correspon-<lb/>
dence he was called upon to de-<lb/>
nounce.</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>YELLOW FEVER SITUATION</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>Reports from Cienfuegos state that<lb/>
only two cases of yellow fever are<lb/>
now under treatment there. No<lb/>
deaths have occurred.</p>
<p>There are two cases in Havana.</p>
<p>------------------</p>
<p>WANTS HIS MONEY.</p>
<p>Eugenio Lopez, who lives at Ar-<lb/>
senal 34, has received three very<lb/>
threatening anonymous letters. They<lb/>
were written by &ldquo;El Silencio,&rdquo; and<lb/>
demanded money from him, which<lb/>
they declared, if not forthcoming<lb/>
would be to the peril of the recip-<lb/>
ient of the letters.</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Lopez has delivered the let-<lb/>
ters to the judge who has ordered an<lb/>
investigation.</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>CUBA COMPANY MEETING</p>
<p>It is announced that the annual<lb/>
meetng of the stockholders of the<lb/>
Cuba Railroad Company will be held<lb/>
in Jersey City on the 18th inst.</p>
<p>Sir William Van Horne. Herbert<lb/>
C. Lakin, Theodore C. Hall and<lb/>
Franklin B. Lord are requesting<lb/>
proxies to be sent them.</p>
<p>At the meeting in question a full<lb/>
board of directors is to be elected,<lb/>
and will attend to such other busi-<lb/>
ness as may come before the meet-<lb/>
ing.</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>Arrived in New York.</p>
<p>New York, Sept. 3.--Vessels ar-<lb/>
riving in this port from Cuba were:<lb/>
The Saratoga and Antilla from Ha-<lb/>
vana, the Camaguey from Guan-<lb/>
tanamo.</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>RANDOM NOTES.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>It makes a great deal of difference<lb/>
to some &ldquo;persons&rdquo; whether they are<lb/>
jostled by other &ldquo;persons&rdquo; who work<lb/>
for a salary, or simply by ones who<lb/>
work for wages.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The members of the late cabinet<lb/>
did not specially need the endorse-<lb/>
ment from Secretary Taft that they<lb/>
were <unclear>honest</unclear></p>
