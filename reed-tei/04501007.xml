<salute>Dear Doctor Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciate very much your letter of December 12.</p>
<p>Frankly, I would like to take your second suggestion--<lb/>
that is, that you write up the affair as if you were our<lb/>
Havana correspondent. I think that we can safely wait until<lb/>
after the end of the year before we publish something in<lb/>
THE JOURNAL. It will be just as interesting then as it<lb/>
would be this week or next.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I have been trying for two or three years<lb/>
to get a correspondent in Havana to give us a letter once a<lb/>
month for publication in THE JOURNAL. It does not have to<lb/>
be long, but I feel that it would be good for the medical<lb/>
profession in both countries if we could develop such a<lb/>
liaison. To be perfectly frank, I have found that &ldquo;ma&ntilde;ana&rdquo;<lb/>
is just as important in Cuba as in some other Latin areas<lb/>
and so far have not got a satisfactory response. I wonder<lb/>
if you know anyone who has had a transfusion from the northern<lb/>
climate and is sufficiently pepped up to do something like<lb/>
that regularly.</p>
<p>I am sorry that the A.M.A. representative arrived so<lb/>
late, but the whole affair was arranged hurriedly, as I was<lb/>
going to be out of town, Doctor Lull would be out of town and<lb/>
Dr. Louis Bauer would not be here. Knowing Doctor Chrisman,<lb/>
I suggested him as a representative, but the arrangements were<lb/>
still being completed at the last minute.</p>
<p>I feel that you should not be asked to bear the expense<lb/>
of purchasing a wreath and therefore ask you to let me know<lb/>
at your earliest convenience how much it cost you. We cer-<lb/>
tainly want to reimburse you.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
