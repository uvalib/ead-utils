<p>He got the money.</p>
<p>Before a visitor has been long on the<lb/>
Zone he is sure to discover that there is<lb/>
a conflict of ideals between Gorgas and<lb/>
Goethals. The whole controversy--for<lb/>
that is what it amounts to--is, I think,<lb/>
one of temperament. Goethals, the prac-<lb/>
tical, scrupulous administrator, makes a<lb/>
fetish of economy. &ldquo;Low costs&rdquo; are his<lb/>
hobby. Gorgas is imaginative and en-<lb/>
thusiastic. He would like to kill every<lb/>
mosquito on the Isthmus, and then begin<lb/>
on the rest of the world. He does not<lb/>
know, unless some one tells him, and<lb/>
even then does not care, whether each<lb/>
mosquito costs five cents or five dollars.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Delendum est.</hi> Goethals does not want<lb/>
to grant a single cent to the Sanitary De-<lb/>
partment which cannot be traced to added<lb/>
labor efficiency. One of the Goethals<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fN0127054"/>
1911 FOREST COUPLETS 969<lb/>
faction summed it up: &ldquo;Why, if you let<lb/>
Gorgas have his way, he'd spend the whole<lb/>
appropriation in six months!&rdquo; Very likely<lb/>
he would. In a moment of enthusiasm<lb/>
he might offer a ten-dollar reward for<lb/>
every mosquito scalp brought to his office;<lb/>
but no one suggests that he would put<lb/>
any of it in his pocket.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Gorgas faction<lb/>
portrays Goethals as endangering the life of<lb/>
our men by withholding necessary appro-<lb/>
priations. Their own statistics, showing<lb/>
that the Zone is at least as healthy a place<lb/>
as New York City, proves that this por-<lb/>
trayal is an exaggeration.</p>
<p>This conflict of ideals, distressing as it at<lb/>
first seems, is very probably a good thing<lb/>
for our Canal. The Sanitary Department<lb/>
has been run with less strict economy than<lb/>
any other. If there had not been a strong<lb/>
hand in check, there might have been<lb/>
gross extravagance. And as long as the<lb/>
sanitary crowd is looking for a chance to<lb/>
yell &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; there is little probability<lb/>
that any dangerous economy will be risked<lb/>
in the department of health.</p>
<p>The whole affair would not be worth<lb/>
mentioning--it has had no result down<lb/>
here beyond generating some personal<lb/>
ill feeling--if it were not for the fact that<lb/>
some steam has been blown off in the<lb/>
papers at home. And those who have<lb/>
rushed into print, as is generally the case<lb/>
in such affairs, are not responsible heads<lb/>
of departments, but underling partisans,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">plus royalist que le roi,</hi> very much more<lb/>
bitter and extreme in their statements<lb/>
than their chiefs would dream of being.<lb/>
Neither the efficiency of the Sanitary<lb/>
Department nor the health of the men on<lb/>
the jobs has been disturbed.</p>
<p>A man with all Colonel Gorgas's re-<lb/>
markable fitnesses--his knowledge of sani-<lb/>
tation, his familiarity with Latin people,<lb/>
his consummate diplomacy, his personal<lb/>
charm and magnetism, which inspire the<lb/>
men under him to their best efforts--<lb/>
who had also a cool, calculating, book-<lb/>
keeping head, might have accomplished<lb/>
the same results somewhat more econom-<lb/>
ically. Very likely cheaper tile drains would<lb/>
have served in some places where concrete<lb/>
drains were laid. But, in spite of our<lb/>
recent ardor for economy and &ldquo;business<lb/>
efficiency,&rdquo; if there is any one thing for<lb/>
which we, as a nation, are willing to stand<lb/>
a little extravagance, it is health. In this<lb/>
department we are more interested in<lb/>
results than methods. And of all the<lb/>
marvels of this immense Canal job of<lb/>
ours--the great engineering triumphs, the<lb/>
high ideal of financial honesty, the spirit<lb/>
of united, collective action--there is noth-<lb/>
ing which stands out more wonderful than<lb/>
the results accomplished by the men and<lb/>
ash-cans under Colonel Gorgas.</p>
