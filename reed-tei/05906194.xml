Mr. George A. Kellogg<lb/>
257 Cornelison Avenue<lb/>
Jersey City, N. J.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mr. Kellogg:</salute>
</opener>
<p>By now you have the various suggestions of myself, General Truby and<lb/>
General Kean regarding the naming of the anonymous figures in the painting and<lb/>
I assume that you will yourself be sending a copy to Fishbein. I am waiting to<lb/>
hear about your final decision because I am not sending my final manuscript of<lb/>
my talk until I hear from you as I will want to put in the extra name in the<lb/>
last paragraph of my talk where I mention the other men.</p>
<p>My talk is divided into two parts--the first couple of pages are to go,<lb/>
I believe, with a news description of the painting; the rest of it is to be used<lb/>
as my paper. It has been edited slightly and is ready for Fishbein as soon as<lb/>
I hear from you.</p>
<p>I am sending you a copy of a very nice letter I just got from Fred<lb/>
Rankin. He really sounds enthusiastic and I am sure you will be able to call<lb/>
on him for whatever help you want. To interest him further, you might send him<lb/>
copies of the three paintings already made.</p>
<p>Just yesterday I received the two engraver's proofs and they are really<lb/>
splendid. To say that I am greatly flattered to receive the proofs numbers 1<lb/>
and 2 is to put it mildly. I am very proud but do think you should have sent<lb/>
the first ones to others who deserve them more. I am selfish enough not to want<lb/>
to give one away. I am going to put one in my office at the Clinic and one in my<lb/>
library at home. I most sincerely thank you for them, also for the very generous<lb/>
supply of colored prints from the newspaper. Did you send one of these to Moran?<lb/>
If not, I should like to do so. I will send the others to people whom I know<lb/>
are not on your list but who have been much interested in the yellow fever story.</p>
<p>I appreciate greatly your offer to pay for a thousand reprints of my<lb/>
Hygeia article with the news article and colored insert. You really embarrass<lb/>
me by your kindness and I don't think I ought to accept that offer, but I will<lb/>
send these out to various men in institutions in connection with my campaign to<lb/>
try to raise money for the memorialization of Camp Lazear, and if you don't think<lb/>
you <unclear>can</unclear> spare that many I will take advantage of buying a thousand reprints at<lb/>
the rate for the last thousand rather than that for the first thousand.</p>
<p>By the way, I want to correct the slight error in one of my previous<lb/>
letters when I was visualizing your McDowell painting. I said that I could just<lb/>
see him operating on his patient, and then by a misprint it indicated that I thought<lb/>
his patient was a man. I know my medical history better than that--I know that<lb/>
it was a woman and don't want you to catch me up on that:</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>

P. S. I have checked up on Moran's rank. Kissinger was a private<lb/>
before the episode but was later promoted to acting hospital steward with<lb/>
a rank of sergeant. Moran had already been acting hospital steward with a<lb/>
rank of sergeant but had been dropped on July 2, 1900 to become a civilian<lb/>
clerk in the headquarters of General Fitzhugh Lee. It was while he was<lb/>
in this capacity that he volunteered to Reed and was kept on as a civilian<lb/>
clerk until February, 1901, all through the time he was at Camp Lazear.<lb/>
Strictly speaking, therefore, he was not a soldier when he volunteered but<lb/>
as he had been just a few weeks before, it seems entirely justified to have<lb/>
him in uniform and to consider him one of the two first &ldquo;soldiers&rdquo; who<lb/>
volunteered.<lb/>
P.S.H.<lb/>
