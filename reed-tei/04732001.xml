<p>DOCTOR ROGER POST AMES</p>
<p>In all the books and articles on the Yellow Fever Experi-<lb/>
ment that I have read, the part Doctor Ames took has never<lb/>
been fully recognized.</p>
<p>The mental picture one gets of Doctor Ames' work is that of<lb/>
the doctor only. It causes one to think of a group of scien-<lb/>
tific men applying the infected mosquitoes and blood drawn<lb/>
from yellow fever patients to the volunteers. Then a number<lb/>
of yellow fever experts make their diagnosis the next day and<lb/>
transfer the patient to the yellow fever section, where Doc-<lb/>
toe Ames takes over.</p>
<p>True, he did take over--and cured them. But from my experience<lb/>
from what I heard first-hand from many of those concerned,<lb/>
this picture isn't exactly right.</p>
<p>As I see the real picture, Major Reed had appointed Doctor<lb/>
&check; Ames to <hi>complete charge of Camp Lazear</hi> as both Medical and<lb/>
Military Officer. Every performance there except when Major<lb/>
Reed was present, was his sole authority. He was the one who<lb/>
was in complete charge of both Camp Lazear and the yellow<lb/>
fever section.</p>
<p>He applied many of the infected mosquitoes used in the tests,<lb/>
and most, probably all, of the blood transfusions. He was the<lb/>
one who called in doctors Finlay, Guiteras, Albertini and<lb/>
Gorgas for their diagnosis. Then, he was the one who, when<lb/>
each of these &ldquo;experts&rdquo; feared to make the ticklish diagnosis<lb/>
so early, made it himself, and transferred the patient to the<lb/>
yellow fever section.</p>
<p>Next day he called these doctors in again, and his diagnosis<lb/>
was invariably verified by all, thereby saving a very, very<lb/>
precious day of treatment for the patient.</p>
<p>I understand that his medical treatment differed but slightly<lb/>
from the standard technique used by other doctors at that<lb/>
time. But his more than 67 patients, including those of Camp<lb/>
Lazear, recovered. A record no other doctor has ever been<lb/>
near to, as several such doctors have told me.</p>
<p>He was a doctor who used psychology in his treatment. He held<lb/>
on to his nurse, Lambert, whom he had used in all his Cuba<lb/>
cases.--A powerful young man who could handle the largest man<lb/>
as gently as if he were a baby, and talked away the strange<lb/>
fear that always haunt these patients, while gently restraining<lb/>
them. Weaker nurses dragged and struggled with their patients<lb/>
thereby inducing black vomit.</p>
<p>&check; Ames was the man who, with his fluent Spanish persuaded those<lb/>
Spaniard patients to stay and undergo the treatment: Who visi-<lb/>
ted the Corpsmen in their quarters, and talked many of them<lb/>
to take the test. None of the first one knew if they would<lb/>
contract yellow fever or not, but the rest of them knew damn<lb/>
well they would, but Ames persuaded them nevertheless. I once<lb/>
heard him say to a group on the barrack steps, &ldquo;No doctor<lb/>
should ask a man to submit to a disease unless he knows he can<lb/>
cure him.&rdquo; They all had confidence in Ames.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f04732002"/>
<p>(2-Ames)</p>
<p>His psychology was illustrated in the case of a Spaniard<lb/>
who was making a slow recovery. He kept this man's close<lb/>
friend, though he had recovered from yellow fever, go to<lb/>
his friend's bedside daily and jingle his bag of gold coins<lb/>
and pour it from hand to hand and tell him that he would<lb/>
have the same when he recovered. His friend got well.</p>
<p>He was the one who, himself recovering from yellow fever<lb/>
when Lambert broke quararentine and came to him and told<lb/>
of the trouble of Andrus, had Lambert and another man move<lb/>
him on his bed to see what was wrong. He corrected the<lb/>
trouble, and perhaps saved Major Reed's favorite case.</p>
<p>That is the Doctor Ames I see. Not simply a physician,<lb/>
important as that is, but next to Reed and Lazear, the<lb/>
most valuable man in the entire experiment. The one who<lb/>
saved its demonstration from failure.</p>
