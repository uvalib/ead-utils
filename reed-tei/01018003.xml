<salute>My dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>The talk which I have been asked to give on the<lb/>
yellow fever campaign in Peru will probably come off on the 22nd of this<lb/>
month, as that is the date suggested by the Secretary of the Johns Hopkins<lb/>
Hospital Medical Society, in the Medical Amphitheatre, the regular meeting<lb/>
place of the society.</p>
<p>Now the object of this preamble is to ask if you wish to make any<lb/>
suggestion in regard to the nature of the talk, or indicate any special<lb/>
feature which you think ought to be especially brought out. In a way the<lb/>
subject is so big that I scarcely know what to include or exclude. I have<lb/>
been working on a sort of an outline draft for the general report which I<lb/>
hope some day to finish and probably publish in its entirety. It would have<lb/>
to be in a phamphlet if published in full on the plans of my present rough<lb/>
draft, which is a sort of preleiminary of ideas and recollections of the<lb/>
work. What I have consists of forty-two pages, eleven of which are single<lb/>
space, and much of what I have jotted down is more on the order of a memo<lb/>
which ought to be elaborated to some extent. Other parts no doubt<del>s</del> ought to<lb/>
be cut out. If I did this Dr. Alva's report ought to be translated and in-<lb/>
cluded as a part of the general report. I have just read it carefully and<lb/>
I think it very good.</p>
<p>I shall probably give a talk of a different nature before Dr. Freeman's<lb/>
class, as he has asked me to do so. Dr. Rose sent me the big map which I believe<lb/>
will help considerably in that it will be a graphic presentation of the geogra-<lb/>
phy of the coast and enable the listeners to follow the sequence of events.</p>
<p>Would you, before the Medical Society, touch on the diagnosis, medical<lb/>
aspects and pathology as we found it in the Peruvian work?</p>
<p>In regard to my work here I am still working on the diphtheria problem<lb/>
which I started, and it is big enough to take up all my time, but I must put in<lb/>
as much time as possible on the surgical pathology and clinical laboratory diag-<lb/>
nosis during the few remaining weeks.</p>
<p>I saw Malley (who was in Nic<del>u</del>aragua) today but have not had much chance to<lb/>
talk to him yet. I knew him some years ago before I went to Panama.</p>
<p>I trust that you are progressing satisfactorily with your Y.F. history.</p>
<p>With best wishes from us all to &ldquo;you all&rdquo;</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely,</salute>
<signed>Henry Hanson</signed>
