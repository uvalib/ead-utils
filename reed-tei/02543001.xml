<salute>My dear Major</salute>
</opener>
<p>I returned yesterday<lb/>
from an inspection trip to<lb/>
various towns in Santa Cla-<lb/>
ra province with Gen. Wood<lb/>
and quite a large party-<lb/>
I got a chance to have<lb/>
a heart-to-heart talk<lb/>
with him &amp; lost no time<lb/>
in broaching the subject<lb/>
which I had at heart-<lb/>
the &ldquo;vitalization&rdquo; of the Med.<lb/>
Corps by the appointment<lb/>
of a certain Distinguished<lb/>
Scientist to be S. G. He at<lb/>
once said in his quick<lb/>
straightforward way that<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02543002"/>
2/<lb/>
he would do every thing<lb/>
in his power to secure<lb/>
you the appointment- that<lb/>
he would talk to the<lb/>
President about it when<lb/>
he went north in Nov, &amp;<lb/>
would urge it - &amp; that he<lb/>
thought you deserved it<lb/>
far more than any other<lb/>
candidate- He also said<lb/>
that he had already told<lb/>
the President that he<lb/>
thought that your dis-<lb/>
covery was worth the<lb/>
entire cost of the Spanish<lb/>
war- He also said<lb/>
that he was sorry to see<lb/>
that you were worried<lb/>
about Gen. S's attitude<lb/>
in the matter <add>of your discovery</add> and that<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02543003"/>
3/<lb/>
you were perfectly safe from all attempts<lb/>
to rob you of any part of your credit.<lb/>
He further said that he was going to<lb/>
mention the matter in a report which<lb/>
he was going to make in a way that<lb/>
would make it perfectly clear that<lb/>
the S. G. had nothing in the world to<lb/>
do with it- So dont waste another thought on that.<lb/>
So there - amigo mio - what more do you<lb/>
wish?- I think OReilly's <unclear>Havana</unclear> pull<lb/>
isnt in it with the lead-pipe <unclear>which</unclear><lb/>
that you have in things- It is not<lb/>
necessary to say how happy I am and<lb/>
how heartily I congratulate you-</p>
<p>Of course many things may happen<lb/>
in nine months but as far as we can<lb/>
see at present I think you have your<lb/>
calling &amp; election sure-</p>
<p>The General seemed to think that we<lb/>
had better enter you for the race in due<lb/>
time, so if you will authorize me to do<lb/>
so, I will about the time that the General<lb/>
goes north put a neat little paragraph<lb/>
in the Times &amp; the Army-<unclear>navy</unclear> Journal<lb/>
So as to set people thinking- And dont do any<lb/>
thing meanwhile to arouse unnecessary antagonism<lb/>
either of uncle George Miller or the Marine Hospital service-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02543004"/>
4/<lb/>
Just follow the tactics<lb/>
of Bre'r Rabbit and<lb/>
keep on saying nothing<lb/>
for the present-<lb/>
Your time has not yet<lb/>
come- After July 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1902<lb/>
you can get out your<lb/>
<unclear>snickersull</unclear> &amp; do what<lb/>
you want to the U. S. <unclear>clen</unclear><lb/>
Horse Marines -- but for<lb/>
the present be wise as<lb/>
a serpent &amp; harmless as<lb/>
a dove &amp; let them work<lb/>
their fake investigations<lb/>
for all they are worth.<lb/>
I hope Gr<hi>al</hi> mio that<lb/>
you will pardon my pre-<lb/>
suming to advise an E. S.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02543005"/>
5/<lb/>
in this way -- but as I<lb/>
have constituted myself<lb/>
your general manager<lb/>
at this end of the line,<lb/>
I cant help doing the<lb/>
duties of my office-</p>
<p>Gorgas gave me a very<lb/>
interesting account of the<lb/>
meeting of the P. H. Assn<lb/>
at Buffalo &amp; how you<lb/>
laid out that fakir Wasdin-<lb/>
By the way is it really true<lb/>
that Sanarelli has given<lb/>
up the claims of his ba-<lb/>
cillus? He has an article<lb/>
I hear in a recent Medical<lb/>
Journal sustaining them-<lb/>
Goodbye &amp; congratulations</p>
