<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of August 28 to the Chief of the Forestry Department<lb/>
in Washington and a copy of Dr. Haig's reply of September 12 have been<lb/>
forwarded to this office.</p>
<p>Your problem is extremely interesting and although such questions<lb/>
are always hard to answer, I like to feel that there is some possibility<lb/>
of working out a proper solution. First, it should be easier for someone<lb/>
in Cuba to estimate the ages of these trees than we in Puerto Rico. This,<lb/>
of course, you <unclear>tried</unclear> to do by looking for a tree expert in Havana. At any<lb/>
rate, I am listing the following names of men, there in Cuba, who might be<lb/>
able to help you in the event that you wish to try farther along that<lb/>
line. They are as follows:<lb/>
<list type="simple">

Encargado de Viveros Forestales<lb/>
<hi>Habana, Cuba</hi></item>
<item>Mr. Juan Tom&aacute;s Roig, Jefe<lb/>
Departamento de Qu&iacute;mica<lb/>
Estaci&oacute;n Experimental Agron&oacute;mica<lb/>

<item>Mr. Juli&aacute;n Acu&ntilde;a, Jefe<lb/>

</list></p>
<p>Now, as for what we might do here from the photographs, brings up<lb/>
the following considerations. We have in Puerto Rico a great many<lb/>
Flamboyant trees growing under a wide range of climatic conditions and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03634002"/>
- 2 -<lb/>
it is possible that we can find trees whose planting date may be<lb/>
definitely determined for comparison with the Cuban trees which you<lb/>
photographed. In that event, it is necessary for us to know as far<lb/>
as possible the conditions of the site where these grew.</p>
<p>Let me then write a bit about the growth of the Flamboyant tree.<lb/>
This species grows rapidly and soon attains its maximum height. The<lb/>
height of the tree, whether in a photograph or seen in the field, will<lb/>
not be an indication of its age, but will be an indication of the<lb/>
conditions of the site, since the species on poor sites will not attain<lb/>
as great a height for any given age as another tree of the same species<lb/>
on a more fertile or more protected site. Thus, both the question of<lb/>
soil depth and soil fe<add>r</add>tility as well as protection from winds come into<lb/>
the picture. If we had the photographs alone, we will have to use the<lb/>
heights of the trees as an indication of the quality of the site, as it<lb/>
is supposed that both camp sites are within the same general climatic<lb/>
section of rainfall and temperature. However, if you can give us any<lb/>
further information as to the exposure of these trees to the wind and<lb/>
as to the conditions of the soil, whether apparently worn out and rocky<lb/>
or deep and fertile, this will be of considerable assistance.</p>
<p>This site factor is extremely important since it would very well<lb/>
be possible for a tree of greater diameter on a good site to be much<lb/>
younger than a tree of smaller diameter on a poor site.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you are asking about a species which does grow over<lb/>
a wide range of climatic conditions. When this is true, minor factors<lb/>
of the site affect the tree much less than it does to those species<lb/>
which are extremely particular as to sites<del>,</del> and grow within a very narrow<lb/>
range of conditions. For example, Spanish cedar is very particular and<lb/>
we may get, within a few feet of each other in plantations, trees with a<lb/>
tremendous difference in diameter even though of the same age. In the<lb/>
Flamboyant, this factor is practically eliminated and provided there is<lb/>
no competition from other trees, we have much better chance of correlating<lb/>
the diameter with age. I am supposing, of course, that it will be<lb/>
possible to estimate the diameters from your photographs. This, we have<lb/>
been able to do before where a human figure was close to the tree and it<lb/>
was possible to compare these and obtain the diameter of the trunk within<lb/>
at least 2 inches. However, I do not wish to be too optimistic about the<lb/>
possibilities of arriving at the approximate ages of these trees. If the<lb/>
dates of planting of these two trees were relatively close together it<lb/>
may be very difficult to say with any certainty which tree is older. At<lb/>
any rate, if you wish to send us the photographs and any other information<lb/>
about the sites which is available, we will certainly be glad to do what<lb/>
we can or will advise you that it is impossible for us to make any state-<lb/>
ment which would be of value to you.</p>
