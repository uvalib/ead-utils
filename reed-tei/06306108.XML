<salute>My dear Miss Reed:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am indeed glad to hear from various sources that you are improving<lb/>
notably and that it is probable that you will be up and around quite soon.</p>
<p>I hate very much indeed to bother you at all while you are in the hospital<lb/>
but a matter has come up about which a decision must be made and as it concerns<lb/>
your distinguished father, I am taking the liberty of dropping you this note.<lb/>
As you may know, a Miss Laura Wood of Washington, D. C. has been asked to write<lb/>
a book for children, about your father. She has been trying to uncover various<lb/>
sources of information, particularly old letters of your father's. Some months<lb/>
ago when she first wrote me, I also had a letter from your brother and from<lb/>
General Kean saying that so far as they knew she seemed to be a responsible per-<lb/>
son and I was encouraged to help her as much as I could. I have therefore given<lb/>
her a fairly large amount of material, part of it from Dr. Kelly's collection<lb/>
which he has given me, and part of it from material which I have collected myself.</p>
<p>You will remember that after the Cleveland unveiling you were kind enough<lb/>
to let me read the intensely interesting manuscript which you had written about<lb/>
your father and in which you had included many of his letters. I mentioned to<lb/>
you that these letters were invaluable to me as they gave certain dates and remarks<lb/>
about which there had been some doubt and you were kind enough to give me permission<lb/>
to copy such portions as would be useful to me. I only did so with the explicit<lb/>
understand that I would not use these letters in any way that would interfere with<lb/>
the publication value of your own manuscript. Although the first part of your<lb/>
manuscript was most interesting, I only made copies of your father's letters as<lb/>
of 1900-1901, that is, the very last part of your manuscript. As I said, I can<lb/>
assure you that these will not be used by me except as background information and<lb/>
to authenticate dates and your father's movements.</p>
<p>Miss Wood has heard of this manuscript and I believe has been trying to<lb/>
get to see you and to borrow it from you or a member of your family. Naturally,<lb/>
because of your illness, this has been impossible. The point I wish to ask you<lb/>
about is this: would you be willing to have me lend her my copy of your father's<lb/>
letters as of 1900-1901 with the understanding that I will insist that she use them<lb/>
as I had intended to use them--only for background information and to corroborate<lb/>
dates of your father's whereabouts. I have never met Miss Wood and of course can<lb/>
not <unclear>touch</unclear> for her personally although her letters breathe an atmosphere of entire<lb/>
reliability. Her book is to be published by the Julian Messner Co., New York City.<lb/>
I would not bother you were it not for the fact that her date line is Nov. 1 and<lb/>
already she is getting rather distraught, nor would I bother you except for the<lb/>

additional fact that she seems sincerely to want to honor your father as<lb/>
I, myself, want to.</p>
<p>With every sincere wish for your early complete recovery, I remain,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
