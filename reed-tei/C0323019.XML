<salute>My dear Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of July 28, <hi>1928</hi>, (better underscore the year)<lb/>
reached me a short time ago, in fact several days, but I was so d---- hot<lb/>
that I could not think clearly enough to write intelligently to a<lb/>
celebrity like you.</p>
<p>You seem to have almost run through the catalogue of ills,<lb/>
and I hope that you have had enough of flu and things for a while. I too<lb/>
have experimented a little in that line since I last saw you,-had an<lb/>
attack of four lobe pneumonia in Miami last March, so you see I am no<lb/>
&ldquo;piker&rdquo; when it comes to having things.</p>
<p>I dont know that I can give you very much help about the<lb/>
quotations or references for the book. Most of the references were from<lb/>
personal communications, letters which I wrote your father from Peru and<lb/>
Colombia. I went over some of these with Frost last fall when I was in<lb/>
Baltimore one day.</p>
<p>Your, " P.8.Hanson Henry (1921) a personal letter.</p>
<p>" P. 10 " " (1922) Re lower limit of<lb/>
aegypti feeding, was observed in<lb/>
Pacasmayo by Dr. Ricardo Mendosa, when<lb/>
he was bitten by an aegypti, the ther-<lb/>
mometer registering 17C. This too if I<lb/>
remember correctly was a personal communication. I have none of<lb/>
my papers with me, and can not say whether this was mentioned <del>o</del><add>i</add>n<lb/>
the general report, written at the close of the campaign.</p>
<p>" P.29. " The reference to aegypti found at<lb/>
<unclear>?&sol;</unclear> Ica, is from the report made by L.H. Dunn and Dr. Caballero when I<lb/>
sent them for a survey of the coast of Peru, south of Lima, from<lb/>
Lima to Arequ<del>p</del><add>i</add>pa.</p>
<p>I am not certain about Sir Rupert Boyce reference, but<lb/>
have an idea I saw something to that effect in the report of the<lb/>
Previous Yellow Fever Commission, the one composed largely of British,<lb/>
my recollection is that I saw it in the first volume. There is a<lb/>
copy of this in the Lagos Office.</p>
<p>I can not tell you which of the Pasteur Commission<lb/>
reports, cites a case of the transmission of infection to progeny,<lb/>
except that it is from the work of the Commission in Brazil. All<lb/>
notes of this kind are with my library at home. Some of them reached<lb/>
Sioux City after I came on to Florida.</p>
<p>I gave a talk before the Medical Society at Ancon<lb/>
Hospital in 1921, which was reported and published in the proceedings<lb/>
of the Canal Zone Medical Society about the end of 1921 or the first<lb/>
part of 1922.</p>
<pb n="2" id="fC0323020"/>
<p>I cant give you any information about Goe<del>d</del><add>l</add>di's statement (1903<del>1</del><add>)</add><lb/>
regarding the breeding of <hi>Stegomyia</hi> in gutters (street gutters).<lb/>
We found them in gutters In Barranquilla, but I felt that it was more<lb/>
a case of their having <del><unclear>been</unclear></del> come there by accident, such as the<lb/>
emptying of a barrel of water in which there were larvae, and they<lb/>
naturally continued their development. We had a similar instance in<lb/>
Bucaramanga, close to a house where breeding was found.</p>
<p>I am sorry that I am so disappointing in the help you<lb/>
hoped I might be able to render.</p>
<p>Since the first of the year I have been working in the<lb/>
capacity of Field Medical Officer, in the Bureau of Communicable<lb/>
Diseases, State Board of Health of Florida, and have found it both<lb/>
instructive and interesting, if not highly remunerative. It has about<lb/>
paid expenses which was as much as I expected when I came down. There<lb/>
are some pretty good malaria problems to work on among the backwoods<lb/>
people here in West Florida. Malaria is one of the big factors in the<lb/>
ill health and poverty of most of the country people in this part of<lb/>
the state.</p>
<p>How long I shal continue here in this work I dont know. The<lb/>
Surgeon General (U.S.P.H.S.) has suggested a possibility o<unclear>f</unclear> going to<lb/>
Singapore, but that is rather uncertain so far.</p>
<p>With all good wishes, and high regards to Frost when you<lb/>
see him, I am</p>
<closer>
