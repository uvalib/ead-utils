General Jefferson R. Kean<lb/>
2804 N Street, North West<lb/>
Georgetown<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am not sure that I ever answered your kind letter of 27<lb/>
January with the most interesting enclosures. I am delighted to have<lb/>
them and the letters of Doctor Finlay, Doctor Guiteras, and others.<lb/>
These are all most interesting.</p>
<p>I am especially happy to hear of Colonel Siler's continued<lb/>
recovery. I just heard from him. By now he has probably sent you<lb/>
the remarks I made at the Meeting of the Walter Reed Memorial Association.</p>
<p>Apropos of the material that you have so kindly given me<lb/>
and other material, may I say that Lazear's daughter, Peggy, is at last<lb/>
becoming interested. Of course, she never met me and probably had sus-<lb/>
picions about my motives but recently she sent me a very interesting<lb/>
booklet which I did not have and told me that she had her father's<lb/>
microscope and was contemplating lending it to me--permanently I hope.<lb/>
Houston and I have been trying to locate it in some hospital in Santa<lb/>
Barbara to which Houston thought his mother had given it. He didn't<lb/>
know that Peggy had it. Recently, therefore, I wrote her a long letter<lb/>
telling her how I became interested in this subject, telling her fully<lb/>
my purposes in making the collection, and telling her that I regarded<lb/>
myself merely as a custodian to a collection that will be made avail-<lb/>
able to all students. She seems really interested now.</p>
<p>Next week I have my course here (Members of the American<lb/>
College of Physicians) and the following week I go to Portland to give<lb/>
three Sommer Foundation lectures and then to Denver to give four lectures.<lb/>
I won't be back for about three weeks.</p>
<p>Recently General Truby returned to me some wonderful answers<lb/>
to a voluminous questionnaire I sent him. He wants me to let you see<lb/>
a copy--which I will do as soon as I catch my breath, but probably not<lb/>
until I return from the west.</p>

<salute>Always sincerely,</salute>
