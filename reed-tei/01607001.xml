<salute>Miss Lawrence,</salute>
</opener>
<p>I owe you an<lb/>
apology for my long delay<lb/>
in answering your last letter.<lb/>
I would have written you<lb/>
promtly, had I not been<lb/>
deterred from so doing by<lb/>
severe sickness. During three<lb/>
long weeks I have been<lb/>
confined to my room, and<lb/>
during the greater part of<lb/>
this time, I was scarcely<lb/>
able to raise my head from<lb/>
the pillow. Hence I have,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01607002"/>
of necessity, been compelled<lb/>
to forego executing many<lb/>
plans which I had projected,<lb/>
no one of which gave me more<lb/>
reason for regret than my<lb/>
inability to write to you.<lb/>
Doubtless, my own folly was<lb/>
the cause of my indisposition.<lb/>
I had been trying to do more<lb/>
than my strength could bear.<lb/>
It may be that I cannot do<lb/>
as much brain-work, in<lb/>
the same length of time, as<lb/>
I could do in my younger<lb/>
days; or perhaps a more<lb/>
correct statement would<lb/>
be that I have, for so long<lb/>
a time, abandoned the habit<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01607003"/>
of hard, continuous appli-<lb/>
cation, as to make it some-<lb/>
what difficult, if not a<lb/>
matter attended with dan-<lb/>
ger, to return into the &ldquo;traces&rdquo;<lb/>
quickly. I remember the<lb/>
time when I could study<lb/>
as much as 20 hours un-<lb/>
interuptedly, day after day,<lb/>
and not experience any bad<lb/>
effect from it, but I pre-<lb/>
sume that time shall return<lb/>
no more. &ldquo;Man wants but<lb/>
little here below, nor wants<lb/>
that little long;&rdquo; thus<lb/>
sang the sweetest bard<lb/>
that ever counted Muse;<lb/>
and, for once, subscribing<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01607004"/>
to that sentiment, I must<lb/>
content myself with the<lb/>
lighter task and leave to<lb/>
others the greater perfor-<lb/>
mance. But really there is<lb/>
a charm in studying that<lb/>
I fain must acknowledge.<lb/>
Let me become interested<del>in</del><lb/>
with what the Author is<lb/>
saying <add>and</add> it is a difficult<lb/>
matter to &ldquo;break the spell&rdquo;;<lb/>
nor do I cease, till my wea-<lb/>
ry senses warn me that<lb/>
nature is well-nigh ex-<lb/>
hausted. Oh! that we<lb/>
would always abide by<lb/>
nature's teachings!<lb/>
Then indeed would <add>we</add> be<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01607005"/>
happy, healthy and wise.<lb/>
Perhaps I decide to dash<lb/>
aside the book and, for<lb/>
once, yield to refreshing<lb/>
sleep; but quicker than<lb/>
ever winged <del>ligtht</del> light-<lb/>
ning cleaved Heaven's<lb/>
vault, the thought flashes<lb/>
through my mind that<lb/>
there are a thousand<lb/>
things in the cast-aside<lb/>
volume of which I am<lb/>
ignorant; a thousand<lb/>
unanswerable questions<lb/>
that may rise up against<lb/>
me, in the day of my<lb/>
examination, to humble<lb/>
and mortify me.<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01607006"/>
Wracked by a thousand<lb/>
fears, I tear open the book<lb/>
and eagerly scan its pages,<lb/>
determined to exhaust every<lb/>
effort, and if need be, to<lb/>
suffer death rather than<lb/>
defeat! This is what I<lb/>
have done, and the result<lb/>
is sickness, mental pa-<lb/>
ralysis -- and it is what<lb/>
I shall not dare repeat.<lb/>
Too happy in having partially<lb/>
regained my strength, I<lb/>
will see to it that I do<lb/>
not precipitate myself<lb/>
into my former unhappy<lb/>
condition. This I can do<lb/>
the more easily, as I have<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01607007"/>
an abundance of time in<lb/>
which to review my studies.<lb/>
A few days ago I received<lb/>
a notice from the Pres.<lb/>
Army Exam. Board that I<lb/>
would not have to stand<lb/>
my examination till<lb/>
Jan. 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>, 1875. Of course,<lb/>
this suits me exactly, as<lb/>
it will give me an oppor-<lb/>
tunity to visit home soon.<lb/>
I would go home, at once,<lb/>
but I don't know where<lb/>
homefolks are, whether<lb/>
at the Springs or in Mur-<lb/>
freesboro. As soon as I<lb/>
hear that they have arrived<lb/>
at home, I shall &ldquo;strike<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01607008"/>
my tents&rdquo; and follow, unless<lb/>
something unforeseen detains<lb/>
me. I assure you that I<lb/>
highly appreciate the kind<lb/>
sympathy which you ex-<lb/>
tended to me. I can study<lb/>
with a lighter heart, know-<lb/>
ing that I possess it.<lb/>
What says the poet? &ldquo;Ah!<lb/>
how skillful grows the<lb/>
hand&rdquo; -- well, unfortunate<lb/>
me, that I should forget<lb/>
the other line, just when<lb/>
I need it. Never mind, I'll<lb/>
remember it some other<lb/>
time and then I'll write<lb/>
it down before I for-<lb/>
get it. Still there are some-<lb/>
things that I do remember,<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01607009"/>
I know that sympathy is<lb/>
the golden cord that binds<lb/>
humanity closer together.<lb/>
To know that a heart<lb/>
beats in friendly sympathy<lb/>
with our own is one of<lb/>
life's sweetest comforts.<lb/>
To what noble aims have<lb/>
not men and women as-<lb/>
pired, encouraged by this<lb/>
same knowledge! It is bet-<lb/>
ter than &ldquo;good news from<lb/>
a far country.&rdquo; It calms<lb/>
the bosom of the tempest-<lb/>
tossed mariner, though<lb/>
all be dark around;<lb/>
it cheers the warrior's<lb/>
heart; dispels his fears;<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01607010"/>
it guides the scholar's pen;<lb/>
attunes the poet's tongue<lb/>
to sweetest strains; bids<lb/>
the down-hearted look<lb/>
up; the faint be strong,<lb/>
and wraps the whole<lb/>
earth in a halo of glory!<lb/>
I know that I have imposed<lb/>
upon your patience by<lb/>
writing so much about<lb/>
my examination; but I'll<lb/>
not do this again. At this<lb/>
moment I bury the sub-<lb/>
ject a thousand fathoms<lb/>
deep, nor will I again<lb/>
resurrect it. I have ever<lb/>
had the misfortune of<lb/>
pouring in to my friend's<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01607011"/>
ears all my anticipations<lb/>
and fears; a fault which<lb/>
I admit is not praise-<lb/>
worthy. Yet it has often<lb/>
relieved me of half the bur-<lb/>
den and brought much<lb/>
comfort to my heart.<lb/>
I had a letter from my<lb/>
good mother a few days<lb/>
before I was taken sick.<lb/>
She was then enjoying her-<lb/>
self at the Springs. In<lb/>
the course of her letter<lb/>
she expressed a somewhat<lb/>
faint desire for a more<lb/>
perfect knowledge of<lb/>
what I was writing to<lb/>
you; a desire possibly<lb/>
attributable to that<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01607012"/>
feeling of curiosity so<lb/>
universally prevalent among<lb/>
the &ldquo;sons (and daughters) of<lb/>
men.&rdquo; In reply, I conveyed<lb/>
to her my regrets <del>at</del><add>in</add> not<lb/>
being able to give her any<lb/>
definite information on<lb/>
the subject; at the same time<lb/>
kindly thanking her for her<lb/>
parental interest. I further<lb/>
intimated that when my<lb/>
letters passed out of my<lb/>
hands they became the<lb/>
property of another, and<lb/>
hence I would refer <add>her</add> to you<lb/>
for more correct infor-<lb/>
mation. Of course, her in-<lb/>
quiry was purely the result<lb/>
of a harmless curiosity,<lb/>
<pb n="13" id="f01607013"/>
and she did not dream<lb/>
that I would mention it to<lb/>
you. I must add that<lb/>
Mrs. R. is, at all times, most<lb/>
profuse in her praises of<lb/>
Miss Lawrence, &amp; can scarce<lb/>
find language to express<lb/>
her admiration of that lady's<lb/>
many superlative qualities.<lb/>
On such occassions her<lb/>
words fall as thick and<lb/>
fast as snow-flakes<lb/>
on a winter's evening. Doubt-<lb/>
less she knows that she<lb/>
has a willing auditor --<lb/>
certainly I have never<lb/>
entered any denial.<lb/>
Before concluding, I will<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f01607014"/>
say a word or two on the<lb/>
&ldquo;Novel&rdquo; question which you<lb/>
were discussing in, your<lb/>
last letter. There can be<lb/>
no doubt but that you have<lb/>
taken the right view of the<lb/>
question. Your legal friend,<lb/>
I think, is wrong, for once.<lb/>
It is not to be supposed<lb/>
that a man should be<lb/>
right on every subject.<lb/>
With your permission, we will<lb/>
leave him out of sight, for a<lb/>
few moments. I do not hesi-<lb/>
tate to say that 98 per ct. of<lb/>
all novels are second or<lb/>
third class -- the worst<lb/>
kind of trashy literature.<lb/>
We must not wonder at this<lb/>
<pb n="15" id="f01607015"/>
when we think of the motives<lb/>
that lead to their production.<lb/>
It often <add>happens</add> that some young<lb/>
man or woman, college-educa-<lb/>
ted, living in luxury, finds<lb/>
it difficult to <del>pass</del><add>idle away</add> the time<lb/>
which hangs so heavily on<lb/>
his or her hands. Woe be to<lb/>
the rest of mankind, if the thought<lb/>
of writing a novel occurs<lb/>
to them. And how often is<lb/>
such the case! Again pov-<lb/>
erty presses some poor<lb/>
unfortunate &amp; he flies<lb/>
to his pen for succor.<lb/>
The result naturally fol-<lb/>
lows that the production<lb/>
must be worthless. To<lb/>
produce a good novel, there<lb/>
<pb n="16" id="f01607016"/>
must be a sound, <hi>thinking</hi><lb/>
brain, the faculty of ob-<lb/>
serving and interpreting, a<lb/>
profound insight into human<lb/>
nature and a keen discrim-<lb/>
ination of character. Well,<lb/>
how often do we find such<lb/>
an one? Perhaps, once in<lb/>
ten thousand instances. I<lb/>
cannot say more at present.<lb/>
I have managed to cover<lb/>
much paper with a very<lb/>
little that is worth the<lb/>
knowing. As this is only the<lb/>
second day that I have been<lb/>
able to sit up, it has been<lb/>
something of an effort to<lb/>
write.</p>
