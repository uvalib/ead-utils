Dr. Pedro Nogueira<lb/>
Marti 219, Marianao<lb/>
Habana, Cuba<lb/>
<salute>My dear Pedro:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I leave here by air Saturday noon, 1:40 p.m. and arrive by way of Miami, landing in<lb/>
Havana at 9:03, flight 415, Sunday morning, November 30.</p>
<p>As Sunday is the only day a doctor really has for <unclear>at</unclear> least <unclear>some</unclear> peace, I do indeed<lb/>
hate to have you think that you have to meet me. If you are at the airport, fine;<lb/>
otherwise I can get to the Hotel Nacional quite readily and can call you later.</p>
<p>The word has gotten around in this country about the dedication and now four or<lb/>
five medical schools want to have the privilege of joining in the ceremony. Three<lb/>
or four deans of medical schools have written me asking if they can have an alumnus<lb/>
in Havana place a wreath beneath one or another of the medallions and I have told<lb/>
them to get in touch with you or with Doctor Rodriguez Exposito. As mentioned<lb/>
previously, the Mayo Foundation has asked me to lay a wreath before the medallion<lb/>
of Doctor Finlay. The University of Virginia has asked me to arrange to have a<lb/>
wreath laid combining honors to Reed, Moran and Kean. I do hope that arrangements<lb/>
can be made whereby these half dozen representatives can place the wreaths during<lb/>
the ceremony.</p>
<p>I am very sorry that despite my long telephone conversation with Hanberry, he just<lb/>
feels that he cannot come. I even tried to help arrange either for a Rochester<lb/>
nurse or an Army nurse to meet him and take him down in a plane but apparently he<lb/>
just can't come. Why not ask Agramonte's daughter, Mrs. Ames or Mrs. Moran to help<lb/>
with the unveiling?</p>
<p>I am delighted to hear about the Finlay decoration. I shall keep that a secret.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the photographs. I note that in the restored caseta you<lb/>
did not use the old sliding window sash. I think the one remaining was original and<lb/>
if you don't want it for the building, I would be very grateful to have it.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
