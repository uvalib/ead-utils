<salute>My Dear Dr. Carroll,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your kind letter and receipted bills received for which I<lb/>
write and thank you very much. I am so very anxious to<lb/>
know more about the circumstances as to how Dr. La<del>x</del><add>z</add>ear<lb/>
contracted yellow fever. In a note from General Wood<lb/>
yesterday he wrote that Dr. La<del>x</del><add>z</add>ear allowed a mosquito to<lb/>
bite his hand that had just bitten a yellow fever patient.</p>
<p>It is possible General Wood could be mistaken--much as I<lb/>
know Dr. La<del>x</del><add>z</add>ear loved his work, I can hardly think that he<lb/>
could have allowed his enthusiasm to carry him so far.</p>
<p>He had talked with me about his work, knowing that I took<lb/>
the greatest interest in it--I knew nothing about your having<lb/>
the fever or that it had again broken out so that the shock<lb/>
was more terrible than thing (sic) we could imagine. I suppose<lb/>
Dr. La<del>x</del><add>z</add>ear's idea of not telling me was to keep me from<lb/>
worrying. He was always so thoughtful where my con<add>m</add>fort<lb/>
was concern (sic) that I cannot believe that he would have<lb/>
done anything so dangerous.</p>
<p>It will be the greatest favor if you will be so kind as to<lb/>
write to me and give me more particulars. Did he feel positive<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02176002"/>
4<lb/>
he would get well if he took the fever and did he know that<lb/>
he could not get well as soon as you did?</p>
<p>I wonder that I can ask such a favor of a stranger, but<lb/>
the people with whom Dr. Laxear worked seem very near. He<lb/>
had often spoken of you.</p>
<p>Please thank Mrs. Carroll for her kind message.</p>
<p>Hope I may know you better sometime. I feel I have not<lb/>
made myself very clear but it is almost impossible to<lb/>
write.</p>
<p>Again thanking you for the money order. Believe me. Very<lb/>
sincerely,</p>
<closer>
<signed>Mable La<del>x</del><add>z</add>ear.</signed>
