<salute>My darling wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I reached here, yesterday afternoon,<lb/>
after a journey of 18 days from Otero- I found<lb/>
awaiting me 2 letters from Sister Ellen; one dated<lb/>
March 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; the other April 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. The lament of both<lb/>
was, &ldquo;Come home as soon as you can, for we are<lb/>
so anxious to see you and baby-&rdquo; She didn't know that<lb/>
you had started- The day on which her last letter<lb/>
was written we were journeying to Old Fort<lb/>
Wingate. There was also a short letter from Pa<lb/>
dated April 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- said that he had got my let-<lb/>
-ter and postal both, &amp; had seen the telegram to John<lb/>
Vaughan, and that, next morning, all hands, except<lb/>
himself, would meet you at the boat, &amp; give you<lb/>
a hearty welcome. I was so much relieved and<lb/>
delighted to get Pa's letter &amp; to know that some one<lb/>
would meet you &amp; son at the boat- I know now<lb/>
that you got back home safely, which lifts a<lb/>
very great burden from my mind- I thought<lb/>
that I had missed you before, my little darling,<lb/>
but I didn't realize how great a void you<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01741002"/>
had left until my return to Apache- Oh! how<lb/>
lovely and desolate it seems here without you<lb/>
my pretty little wife and my sweet &ldquo;bad daddies&rdquo;-<lb/>
I am utterly lost- I intend to go back &amp; live in<lb/>
the same quarters we occupied- Shall take <add>the</add> par-<lb/>
lor &amp; hall &amp; have Altman at present, busily <add>at</add><lb/>
work cleaning up &amp; scrubbing- Our bed-room stands<lb/>
just as we left- Poor little Lawrence's cradle al-<lb/>
most brought the tears- I had to turn away- The<lb/>
memories were to sweet- I couldn't live in that<lb/>
room to save me- Dr McPherson, I think, will<lb/>
take it, &amp; then we will enjoy the spacious hall in<lb/>
Common- Poor little <unclear>Undnia</unclear>, my darling wife, has<lb/>
remained at the house<del>ful</del>, as a faithful little<lb/>
guardian ever since my absence- She has only<lb/>
left for a few minutes at a time to get food<lb/>
&amp; then would go back &amp; remain in the yard,<lb/>
day &amp; night- no one <del>would</del> could coax her away-<lb/>
While I was taking my bath, I sent Altman<lb/>
for her- He brought her to the door &amp; put her inside<lb/>
of the room- I didn't look at her or say a word-<lb/>
At first, she started to another part of the<lb/>
room, without seeing me- but suddenly turned<lb/>
&amp; came bounding to me in all ecstacy of delight.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01741003"/>
I never saw such demonstrations of happiness.<lb/>
She whined &amp; jumped about here &amp; there &amp; tore around<lb/>
the room as if she was crazy- would <add>not</add> let me put<lb/>
my socks on- was up in my lap &amp; kissing me, &amp; then<lb/>
down about my feet &amp; tearing around the room<lb/>
as if she had lost her senses- Has staid right<lb/>
with me, &amp; last night slept by my bed in the<lb/>
large house &amp; by 3 o'clock, this morning, was under<lb/>
the cover &amp; nestling close to my back- This is the<lb/>
first night she has spent away from the old house<lb/>
since we left. I tell you, my darling Emilie, this<lb/>
affection &amp; faithfulness, on little Undie's part,<lb/>
went straight to my heart, and no money can<lb/>
buy her- She comes east with me, if it takes twenty<lb/>
five dollars- She will <add>be</add> lots of company to<lb/>
me &amp; a constant reminder of my loved ones-<lb/>
<hi>Friday</hi>, May 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- I have again been busy all<lb/>
day to-day, my darling wife, fixing up my Quar-<lb/>
ters- The <unclear>Nuncio</unclear> &amp; myself have worked hard all day<lb/>
&amp; have about done everything necessary- except<lb/>
to get two panes of glass put in the back window<lb/>
and put up strings for the hop vines- You would<lb/>
be astonished to see how prettily all the quar-<lb/>
ters are covered with hop vines- They had no<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01741004"/>
cold weather during my absence &amp; hence every-<lb/>
thing is looking very green &amp; beautiful- The flowers<lb/>
that you gave Col. C. are very pretty &amp; he &amp; Mrs.<lb/>
C. are very proud of them- Would my precious<lb/>
little wife like to know what my bed-room looks<lb/>
like? Well I'll describe it- Firstly, I've got at my<lb/>
windows the green shades &amp; lace curtains which<lb/>
we left u<del>p</del>npacked- to-morrow, I am going to get<lb/>
some pretty pink ribbon from the Suller's to<lb/>
tie them or rather loop them back with &amp; then, they<lb/>
will look real pretty &amp; stylish- I haven't got<lb/>
any pretty little wifie to tie a pretty bow for me<lb/>
so that I am afraid it will give me much trouble<lb/>
to get them all straight &amp; nice, but the <unclear>Nuncio</unclear> &amp; myself<lb/>
will do our best- I've got a hospital bed-stead,<lb/>
two mattrasses &amp; plenty of bed clothing - a nice white<lb/>
counterpane- The bed stands in the left hand corner<lb/>
as you enter the room- I have taken our old dining ta-<lb/>
ble as a centre table &amp; put my table cover on it &amp; also my<lb/>
pigeon hole desk, containing my papers, stands on the table-<lb/>
between the back window &amp; the corner book-shelves, stands<lb/>
the bureau with looking-glass swinging gracefully<lb/>
above it- Directly opposite the bureau on the other<lb/>
side of the room, is the wardrobe &amp; on the other side<lb/>
of the front window stands the washstand- my trunk<lb/>
is in the corner behind the door- On the floor reposes<lb/>
pensively the old bear skin &amp; a Luni blanket which<lb/>
I purchased on my travels- The corner book-shelves<lb/>
are filled with books &amp; the mantel-piece groans<lb/>
under a few likewise - on one side of the looking-glass<lb/>
is suspended the shaving can which my darling wife<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01741005"/>
made for me- Just below it hangs the wisp broom.<lb/>
I forgot to say that my mantel is also adorned with<lb/>
an owl &amp; a duck, one at each end, specimens of<lb/>
Luni pottery which I will bring east- my pictures<lb/>
I don't think I will hang up, <add><del>nor</del></add> my little precious, for<lb/>
the very good reason that I haven't got any.<lb/>
My hall is decorated with my little round, folding table,<lb/>
on which stands the water pitcher &amp; tumbler; a nice<lb/>
white mat, which I found in my wash, under each-<lb/>
A few chairs idle away their time around the table-<lb/>
On the side-board, are seen some bottles of medicines<lb/>
which the <unclear>Nuncio</unclear> has arranged very artistically.<lb/>
Undina adorns the front porch, &amp; my house is de-<lb/>
scribed- Now don't you, my pretty little Emilie,<lb/>
wifie, wish that you were back, just to live in<lb/>
such nice, comfortable quarters? I had no idea<lb/>
that I would make my room look so well- If I<lb/>
only had a good board floor, instead of the rough<lb/>
unplaned boards, my room would look real<lb/>
comfortable- But I am entirely satisfied, for I<lb/>
know it will only be a few months before I<lb/>
leave, and about as happy &amp; contented as I can be<lb/>
with<add>out</add> my own precious wife &amp; boy with me- what<lb/>
did they all say of &ldquo;bad daddies&rdquo;,? Tell papa every-<lb/>
thing they said about his lovely little boy, for papa<lb/>
knows that none of them had ever seen such a<lb/>
splendid specimen of a boy before- I want to<lb/>
know just what sister Ellen thinks of him-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01741006"/>
give me her exact words- for I know she thinks<lb/>
he is a darling boy- Have you succeeded in<lb/>
obtaining a nurse for Lawrence yet? I do trust you<lb/>
have &amp; that you have got an excellent one- Are<lb/>
you enjoying yourself all you can, my darling<lb/>
Emilie? Now don't forget, my loved wife, that I<lb/>
insist upon it that you must cast aside every<lb/>
care you can &amp; be such a bright &amp; gay little<lb/>
darling- and do you do just what you please &amp; I<lb/>
will be responsible for it- If you need more<lb/>
money, don't hesitate to write &amp; I will, with the<lb/>
greatest pleasure in life, send it to my darling<lb/>
little wifie, who is the best &amp; dearest little<lb/>
woman in this whole world- Don't forget it-<lb/>
we have just heard that Army appropriation<lb/>
bill has passed, so that our pay is secure<lb/>
for another year- Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> Oakes has left Arizona,<lb/>
which puts Col. Compton in Command of the Reg-<lb/>
-iment &amp; I think the band with Mr Carter &amp;<lb/>
Kerr, will soon be at Apache- Won't that be<lb/>
grand? If so, won't these old hills about Apache<lb/>
echo to the sweet music every day &amp; night?<lb/>
How, I wish my loved ones could be here to<lb/>
enjoy it! but I'd rather they were where they are,<lb/>
for their sakes-<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01741007"/>
Saturday night, 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- Did I tell my darling little wife,<lb/>
that Camp Apache has had its name changed and<lb/>
is now called <hi>Fort</hi> Apache? Remember this, Emilie dar-<lb/>
ling, &amp; direct those many sweet letters you are going<lb/>
to write accordingly- I succeeded in getting the two<lb/>
panes of glass, from the Quartermaster, to supply the<lb/>
place of the broken ones, and Altman, this morning, put<lb/>
them in very nicely, so that the cold, night draughts<lb/>
are effectually excluded. I got the pink ribbon from<lb/>
the <unclear>Sutter's</unclear> to-day, &amp; now my curtains are looped back<lb/>
most winsomely- but <add>not</add> as prettily as my precious wifie<lb/>
would have done it- Love your dear heart, Emilie,<lb/>
how Mantee missed you when he came to arrange<lb/>
his room. How much I needed my smart little<lb/>
darling to tell me just where this thing &amp; that should<lb/>
go! I know of no one who can put a room in<lb/>
as perfect order and fitness as my Emilie<lb/>
wife, who isn't <hi>petted half enough</hi>- Bless her<lb/>
heart &amp; papa's boy's little life, how much he misses<lb/>
them every day. Oh! when I go away from this old<lb/>
house on any errand &amp; then come back &amp; enter<lb/>
it, and find no wifie &amp; no &ldquo;bad daddies&rdquo;, my heart<lb/>
comes right into my mouth! It seems so strange<lb/>
when I go out to the water barrel<del>l</del> &amp; look into the<lb/>
back window on my return &amp; not see my darling<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01741008"/>
boy standing in his crib, waiting to laugh &amp;<lb/>
hollow at papa- To tell the truth, darling, I can't<lb/>
bear the sight of that horrid, old window- And<lb/>
to-day, I found &ldquo;didn't day's&rdquo; nursing bottle with<lb/>
the old torn nipple on it! These reminders of my<lb/>
precious darlings meet me at every turn and make<lb/>
me <hi>so sad</hi> for the time; but I guess I must become<lb/>
used to it. Altman &amp; I have got the strings up<lb/>
for the hop vines on the parlor side of the house &amp;<lb/>
around the porch- Monday we will complete the other<lb/>
side- The vines are already taking hold of the strings that<lb/>
we have put up &amp; as Altman gives them plenty<lb/>
of water every evening they will soon look beauti-<lb/>
ful- The <unclear>Nuncio</unclear> frequently speaks of Lawrence &amp;<lb/>
often remarks that there are not many such<lb/>
fine children- Says that he has observed closely<lb/>
but that he has never seen a finer, stronger boy,<lb/>
He often inquires of you too &amp; says he lost a<lb/>
&ldquo;good friend<del>s</del> by mr's Reed going away&rdquo;! I think he<lb/>
will be a good striker for me, as he seem to be<lb/>
very attentive- So far he keeps my room in nice order.<lb/>
Well, my sweet little wifie, as it is about 10 A.M. &amp; little<lb/>
Undie lies stretched before the fire &amp; is snoring her very<lb/>
best, I think I had better say &ldquo;goodnight&rdquo; to my own precious<lb/>
darling, and &ldquo;pleasant dreams&rdquo;- Oh! to press you to my heart for<lb/>
one moment! Goodnight &amp; sweet kisses to papa's boy also-<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01741009"/>
Sunday, May 18- I had been waiting very impatiently<lb/>
all day for the mail to arrive, thinking that I would<lb/>
certainly get a long letter from darling little wifie, but<lb/>
instead I only got a postal forwarded from Wingate<lb/>
by Dr Torney- This was written the same day on which<lb/>
you reached Norfolk- Bless your darling heart,<lb/>
my lovely wife, I know your heart was full of joy<lb/>
when you at last found a resting place &amp; so many<lb/>
dear friends- Nothing pleases me more than to know<lb/>
that you are happy &amp; where you can rest &amp; enjoy<lb/>
your sweet self; and that you have succeeded in<lb/>
procuring a good woman <del>for</del> <add>as</add> a nurse for our<lb/>
darling boy. Oh! Emilie, love, what a relief it<lb/>
must be to you, to be able to sit down among<lb/>
your family &amp; friends and be undisturbed by the<lb/>
dread &amp; fear of soldier cooks leaving you- Husband<lb/>
knows what a perfect respite it must be <add>to</add> you<lb/>
darling, &amp; he rejoices accordingly. No man loves &amp;<lb/>
appreciates his wife more than your own dear<lb/>
Mantee, and he knows <add>too</add> that no wife ever loved <add>her husband</add> more<lb/>
devotedly than his own, precious, sweet, darling &ldquo;ooman-<lb/>
tee&rdquo;! Isn't that so, Emilie, wifie! Oh! to know that you<lb/>
are back East once more, away from Arizona<lb/>
cares and burdens &amp; with your own dear loved ones;<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01741010"/>
when I think of this, I could easily shed tears of<lb/>
happiness &amp; thankfulness- I miss you, darling; yes<lb/>
miss you &amp; Lawrence sorely; but yet I had so much<lb/>
rather that you should be where you are, under<lb/>
no circumstances could I ever consent to your return<lb/>
to Arizona- Next October, I hope to start East to join my<lb/>
sweet wife &amp; boy- May is more than half gone &amp; the<lb/>
time will soon fly past, but not too swiftly for me<lb/>
whose most ardent desire is to see my own pre-<lb/>
cious wife &amp; darling son again-</p>
<p>By the way, did you know that Miss Carrie Wilkins<lb/>
was married? I was perfectly astonished to hear<lb/>
of it- She was married in Washington, about<lb/>
the middle of April to her old admirer, Captain<lb/>
Porter, 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Infantry. Mrs. Andrews writes to Mrs.<lb/>
Harrison that she was present and that Miss<lb/>
Carrie looked very pretty. By this time, Mrs.<lb/>
Andrews is almost ready to start back to her<lb/>
Post. Mrs. Harrison says that she was com-<lb/>
-pletely lost for a few days after you and<lb/>
Lawrence left- Never missed any one so<lb/>
much in her life. She sends all manner of<lb/>
love &amp; kind messages. Mrs. Hentig is looking bet-<lb/>
ter than I ever saw her. Sends much love, Is<lb/>
<pb n="11" id="f01741011"/>
very much obliged to you for your trouble<lb/>
in getting the hat- Mrs. Harrison now vows that<lb/>
she will come East when I am ordered out-<lb/>
She is not looking very well &amp; says she is so<lb/>
tired &amp; worn out with Apache that she thinks<lb/>
she will die, if she has to remain here all of<lb/>
1879- I was premature in my allusion to the<lb/>
appropriation bill. It has not yet passed, but<lb/>
is pretty sure to do so-</p>
<p>Tuesday 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> may. You perceive my darling little<lb/>
wifie, that I have been writing this letter by piece<lb/>
-meal. A little every day, except <add>Monday</add> <del>Tuesday</del>- Did<lb/>
I tell my little apple-pie, that I arrived at Apache<lb/>
with a very sore throat? I am now quite<lb/>
well, but, I assure you, darling, that I had a<lb/>
pretty sick time of it for a few days. Caught<lb/>
the cold the night we stopped at McCarty's<lb/>
Ranch-slept out of doors &amp; had nothing to put<lb/>
on my head- I tell you, Emilie, love, I missed<lb/>
my cap very much- well, three days after,<lb/>
when I reached Luni, my throat not only was<lb/>
very sore, but I was so hoarse that I couldn't<lb/>
speak above a whisper. &amp; that night very<lb/>
sick at my stomach- You remember the<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f01741012"/>
wind &amp; sand at <unclear>Zuni</unclear>, the day we arrived there,<lb/>
well two days could not be more alike than<lb/>
the day in April &amp; the one in May- The sand was<lb/>
perfectly blinding &amp; Dr Eli's room in greater<lb/>
confusion than ever- They are living in all the<lb/>
uproar, &amp; dirt as when we saw them- I had<lb/>
told Mrs. Compton about the room, &amp; how you<lb/>
sat &amp; gazed out of the window so abstractedly-<lb/>
She said that she was not surprised at what<lb/>
I told her of your feelings; that as for herself<lb/>
she was completely dazed. Oh! the sand &amp; the dirt:<lb/>
next morning when we left, the wind <del>an</del> was<lb/>
blowing so cold, that Mrs. C. &amp; I sat inside with<lb/>
all windows down &amp; five blankets &amp; the robe<lb/>
over us- In fact we did not have a warm<lb/>
day on our return- Before I forget it, darling,<lb/>
please send my cap (I mean the one &ldquo;bad daddies&rdquo; wore)<lb/>
&amp; a cravat by the first mail, after you get this.<lb/>
The mails are now alright &amp; run regularly- I<lb/>
am going to study Spanish very hard till I come-<lb/>
know how to ask for &ldquo;agua chicita&rdquo; &amp; many<lb/>
other things- I must close, my letter, though I do so<lb/>
very reluctantly- Heaven bless &amp; guard you<lb/>
my own precious Emilie &amp; sweet little son- send<lb/>
papa his photograph as soon as you can have<lb/>
it taken, for he <add>is</add> so anxious to see his boy- Your's too dar-<lb/>
ling, if you will have it taken-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Best love to all- a thousand<lb/>
kisses from papa to mother &amp; son- write very often to your devoted<lb/>
husband who thinks of his sweet wife always.</salute>
