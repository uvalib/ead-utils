My dear Truby</p>
<p>Your M M S of the Yellow<lb/>
Fever Episode in Havana in 1900-<lb/>
1901 came this morning and I<lb/>
have spent the best part of the<lb/>
day most agreeably in the memo<lb/>
ries of forty <unclear>years'</unclear> ago while<lb/>
reading it- I have made a<lb/>
few notes in pencil in answer<lb/>
to your pencil queries on the<lb/>
blank sides of the pages and<lb/>
have made a few unimportant<lb/>
corrections and am returning it<lb/>
as you may want to send it off<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06284044"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
2<lb/>
to Dr. Hench- Your many interesting<lb/>
details and the freshness of<lb/>
your memory will be a great<lb/>
help and joy to him, as it is to<lb/>
me- I have been able to help<lb/>
you out with a few dates, but<lb/>
my diary is far from full &amp;<lb/>
I find I made no entries at all<lb/>
for the first two weeks of Nov.<lb/>
1900- I was very busy in those<lb/>
days and did not take my<lb/>
diary very seriously - but as my<lb/>
diary has always been a factual<lb/>
one intended to help out a poor<lb/>
memory I have been always very<lb/>
careful to get accurately what<lb/>
I have recorded in it-</p>
<p>As to Agramonte's claims which<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06284045"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
3<lb/>
you find unfounded, I dont<lb/>
think I ever had any knowledge<lb/>
and certainly have nothing which<lb/>
I could put up against his claims<lb/>
of having looked after the mosqui-<lb/>
to work, but you have, and I am<lb/>
perfectly willing to accept your memory.<lb/>
I doubt however whether it is worth<lb/>
while after all these years to raise<lb/>
the question- I am much pleased<lb/>
to have you bring to light the work<lb/>
of Sergt. Neate and I know it<lb/>
would please Walter Reed if the<lb/>
spirits of the dead can follow the<lb/>
small affairs of this world-</p>
<p>I remember that he came to me and<lb/>
spoke as you have done of Neate's<lb/>
faithful reliability and said that<lb/>
he would like to get a gratuity for him<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06284046"/>
4<lb/>
(You know Gen. Wood had put the fund<lb/>
in my hands for disbursement.) So he<lb/>
proposed that Neate should be the guinea<lb/>
pig for a test if <hi>Pungens</hi> could carry<lb/>
yellow fever and it was done and<lb/>
he got his $100- but <add>it</add> did not come<lb/>
within the specifications for the Roll<lb/>
of Honor- By the way there are some<lb/>
rank candidates now attempting to<lb/>
break in on the Roll of Honor <unclear>and</unclear> as<lb/>
they have pooled forces, and the<lb/>
Military Committees are now much<lb/>
occupied with great affairs, there<lb/>
is some danger that they may break<lb/>
in- One in the very comely widow<lb/>
of Dr. Roger Post Ames who has the<lb/>
backing of Senator Shepherd Chairman<lb/>
of Senate Military Committee. Of course<lb/>
Ames did not have experimental <unclear>y. f.</unclear><lb/>
or risk his life in any test and I think<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06284047"/>
5<lb/>
that his subsequent behavior in trying<lb/>
to establishing a record of having<lb/>
yellow fever in Columbia Hospital<lb/>
later, (when he probably realized that<lb/>
it would be valuable) and his<lb/>
experiments later with human life<lb/>
in the infection of Pvt. D. L. Driscoll<lb/>
Co. F. 26 <unclear>Inf</unclear> at Fort M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Intosh when it<lb/>
had no scientific value, but might put<lb/>
him in the lime light, these were really<lb/>
criminal acts which negative his<lb/>
good work at Columbia Bks-<lb/>
This poor man Driscoll is now also<lb/>
an applicant for the Roll of Honor<lb/>
&amp; the accompanying pension, tho -<lb/>
his case <unclear>did</unclear> not advance the<lb/>
knowledge of the cause of yellow fever<lb/>
at all: as the fact had been already<lb/>
fully demonstrated- Affectionate regards<lb/>
to your good wife- Mrs Ireland has just<lb/>
had her gall bladder removed with a big stone in it-<lb/>
&amp; is doing very well</p>
<p>Cordially yours,<lb/>
J. R. Kean<lb/>
P. S. over<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06284048"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
P. S. I think that you have been<lb/>
very kind and generous in the<lb/>
mention of me that you make<lb/>
in various places in your<lb/>
fine article and I do not<lb/>
want to send off your excel-<lb/>
lent article without thanking<lb/>
you for it.<lb/>
