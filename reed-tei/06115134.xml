<salute>My dear Miss Woods:</salute>
</opener>
<p>After some delay my commission (lieutenant colonel) and final orders came<lb/>
through yesterday. I leave on the seventh for a month or two of preliminary training<lb/>
at Fort Custer near Battle Creek and then go to be chief of the medical service at<lb/>
the Station Hospital, Camp Carson, near Colorado Springs. I think you had better<lb/>
address me here as I don't know my exact post office address in these camps.</p>
<p>I am delighted to know that the Junior Literary Guild is sponsoring your book.<lb/>
I know you hate the delay but the money will be very welcome.</p>
<p>I am sorry that you have had the Kissinger-Moran controversy reopened for you.<lb/>
I can't begin to go into this controversy within the confines of a letter and wish<lb/>
that we could chat over it and I could tell you a lot of personal and confidential<lb/>
things that I have uncovered about it. Very briefly the situation is this. Each of<lb/>
these men insisted vehemently to me that he was the first and that the other volunteered<lb/>
a day or so later. Kissinger is a sweet old thing but <add><unclear>a</unclear></add> rather ignorant, uneducated<lb/>
farmer who because of illness and destitute circumstances had to go into the &ldquo;hero<lb/>
business&rdquo; as his only means of support. In a simple, childlike way he has enjoyed it<lb/>
but he is thoroughly honest within the limits of his memory and a fine character. Hav-<lb/>
ing told and retold his story ten thousand times and having lived on his past experience<lb/>
you can see how his story might well become colored. I visited his home and indeed<lb/>
had him up here visiting us and took his story down in shorthand. It is riddled with<lb/>
errors and while it was slightly helpful, his story has been the least helpful of all<lb/>
the survivors.</p>
<p>Moran is a much stronger, abler character, completely and utterly honest<lb/>
I am sure but not adverse on occasion to telling a white lie when his code of an Irish<lb/>
gentleman seems to demand it. My original purpose in 1937 and 1938 was to get the<lb/>
story of these two men and publish it. The snag here was that on the main issue--the<lb/>
most dramatic point of the story--that of the volunteering--they entirely disagreed.</p>
<p>A few months ago I uncovered a letter written by Moran several years ago to Dr.<lb/>
Peabody of New York who, as you know, was largely responsible for the medals and in this<lb/>
letter Moran specifically stated that he had volunteered first, talked the matter over<lb/>
that night with Kissinger and that Kissinger either the next day or the following day had<lb/>
volunteered. I already had a different story from Moran himself: that Moran had <hi>decided</hi><lb/>
to volunteer, had talked most of the night with Kissinger and that they had both gone in<lb/>
the next day and volunteered. The last time I visited Havana, toward the end of my<lb/>
visit, I sprang that discrepancy on Moran, actually showing him the two versions in<lb/>
his own handwriting. After an embarrassing long period of silence, he turned to me<lb/>
and said, &ldquo;Dr. Hench, now you know that we are all liars--all of us connected with the<lb/>
yellow fever experiments. Why don't you just quit the whole thing?&rdquo; He seemed much<lb/>
distressed that I had caught him in this discrepancy and it took some talking and<lb/>
diplomacy on my part to make him open up and explain it. I cannot give it to you in<lb/>
detail but in brief this is the explanation: that he in fact did volunteer first,<lb/>
that he was quite disappointed when Reed inoculated Kissinger first as he (Moran) had<lb/>
volunteered first, as he had expected that &ldquo;honor&rdquo;; that later, when Kean presented<lb/>
Kissinger with a watch and a citation he (Moran) an ex-army man not in uniform was<lb/>

Miss Laura Wood<lb/>

only invited to stand on the sidelines and received no watch nor citation. All of<lb/>
these had hurt him--to think that because he was not in uniform, his enlistment<lb/>
having just ended, that he was treated differently from one still in uniform. It<lb/>
hurt <unclear>him</unclear> to think that Reed had allowed the distinction to be made, but later (as<lb/>
he explains his motives), in order to restore his loyalty to Reed and not expose<lb/>
this slight flaw in Reed's character he (Moran) changed his story to agree with that<lb/>
of Kissinger (in order to smooth everything out). He wants to stick to the latter<lb/>
story that they enlisted together even though he insists it is not true.</p>
<p>Nobody really knows who enlisted first. I don't even think Kissinger himself<lb/>
knows. General Kean is under the impression that Moran volunteered first but that<lb/>
Kissinger was bitten first. I don't have my records with me but isn't it right that<lb/>
both were bitten on the same day but Kissinger got sick first? General Truby told<lb/>
me that he thought that Kissinger volunteered first. Why not avoid this controversy?<lb/>
It is of no interest to school children and unless you give them equal preference<lb/>
either one or the other of these two good and worthy characters will be hurt. They<lb/>
will be much less hurt and much more satisfied if you and I and those to follow<lb/>
after make the compromise and say that they volunteered essentially together.</p>
