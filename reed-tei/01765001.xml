<salute>My precious little wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am quite tired<lb/>
out and feel a little sore in my back and<lb/>
bones, to-night, but I must write at<lb/>
least a page to my darling Emilie before<lb/>
I go to-bed- I have just returned from<lb/>
a hunting expedition of 7 days duration;<lb/>
got home, this afternoon, about 2 o'clock,<lb/>
after riding the whole day, since early<lb/>
morning, in a blinding snow-storm -- a<lb/>
real Christmas, Santa Claus snow-storm<lb/>
&ldquo;one that you read about in the books&rdquo;,<lb/>
lovie- But I'll wait till to-morrow morn-<lb/>
-ing before giving you an account of<lb/>
our wonderful hunt- Your precious<lb/>
letter of Decr 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> was here waiting for<lb/>
me, and before I had finished reading<lb/>
the first page, Oh! how <add>my</add> very heart<lb/>
yearned in heart-felt pity and sym-<lb/>
-pathy for my precious wife sitting<lb/>
by the bed-side of our darling little<lb/>
son and watching and waiting and praying<lb/>
through the long hours of <add>the</add> day &amp; the longer<lb/>
ones of night! Oh! my darling wifie,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01765002"/>
how your poor heart must have been<lb/>
weighed down with its burden of anx-<lb/>
-iety and fear, lest our precious boy should<lb/>
have <add>been</add> taken from us! Oh! with what a<lb/>
grateful heart, I shall, this night, kneel<lb/>
in prayer to God, who has, in his infinite<lb/>
goodness and mercy spared our sweet boy's<lb/>
life! Words cannot express the sense of grat-<lb/>
itude with which my heart is overflowing!<lb/>
If I could only have been with my own<lb/>
loved wifie, to have shared the burden with<lb/>
her, &amp; to have kissed away her tears! Love<lb/>
your precious life! You did just right in<lb/>
not mentioning Lawrence's sickness, until<lb/>
he had recovered, for my very existence<lb/>
would have been one of misery! I could<lb/>
not have spent one happy hour during<lb/>
the week! Follow strictly Dr Moore's direc-<lb/>
tions in all things- Please, Emilie, darling,<lb/>
thank him, for me, for his kindness and atten-<lb/>
tion to Lawrence, but do not insult him<lb/>
by offering to pay him- He is an estima-<lb/>
-ble physician, &amp; such a thing as charging<lb/>
for attendance on a brother-physician's<lb/>
family would be unheard of! Don't<lb/>
fail to thank him kindly, (as I know you<lb/>
have done,) and when you have done this,<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01765003"/>
you have taken all the steps necessary<lb/>
in the matter- It may seem strange to<lb/>
you <del>to</del> not <add>to</add> pay your physician, but re-<lb/>
-member, my darling, that you<del>r</del> are a<lb/>
physician's wife, and the ethics of the med-<lb/>
-ical profession require of all physicians,<lb/>
of good standing, to attend other physicians'<lb/>
family <hi>free</hi> of <hi>charge</hi>! Dr Moore <hi>Cannot</hi><lb/>
expect you to pay him,- Indeed, I know<lb/>
he has not given the matter a thought!<lb/>
and would be surprised, and perhaps, offended,<lb/>
should you ask for a bill! Bear in mind<lb/>
what I have said, my precious wife, and<lb/>
never bother your head about <hi>medical</hi><lb/>
bills. I would write more, to-night, but<lb/>
I am so tired &amp; sleepy, darling wifie, that<lb/>
I must go to bed early- Good-night my<lb/>
sweet wifie &amp; son, and may guardian an-<lb/>
gels watch over your slumbers till the<lb/>
morning comes! <hi>Decr 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1879</hi>. <hi>7 O'clock</hi>. <hi>A.M.</hi><lb/>
You see, my pretty wifie, that I am up bright<lb/>
and early writing to my darling &ldquo;Nemps&rdquo;- I<lb/>
thought that I would write, while Dr Mc<lb/>
Pherson was over attending Sick-call.<lb/>
I wish you could see the old Apache<lb/>
parade, this morning. It looks as if<lb/>
some one had emptied over it a few<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01765004"/>
Sacks of the choicest &ldquo;family flour&rdquo;- No, I will<lb/>
retract that expression, for it is a shame to<lb/>
liken so beautiful a sight to any of man's<lb/>
doings- Everything that the eye can take in<lb/>
is covered with a mantle of the purest white.<lb/>
What a multitude of imperfections Nature<lb/>
has covered up during the night- Even<lb/>
&ldquo;Laundry Row&rdquo;, where so many &ldquo;fine gals&rdquo;<lb/>
are said to dwell, presents a &ldquo;most char-<lb/>
-ming&rdquo; appearance- You might imagine,<lb/>
my darling wifie, that the huts had been<lb/>
transformed into palaces, in a single night,<lb/>
and instead of the &ldquo;Swan-necked&rdquo; Hosey and &ldquo;Mrs.<lb/>
Mahoney, dear&rdquo;, living therein &amp; lingering over<lb/>
the pensive wash-tub, that knights &amp; ladies<lb/>
made merry music there! &ldquo;I want to know&rdquo;-<lb/>
Our old back-yard, with its giant kitchen,<lb/>
and meandering walks &amp; embowered water<lb/>
shed &amp; various other objects of interest<lb/>
which I need not mention, but with which<lb/>
my darling<del>s</del> &ldquo;Nemps&rdquo; is sufficiently familiar<lb/>
resembles very much the loveliest spot<lb/>
in Central Park, New York- What shall I<lb/>
say of the pines on the mountain sides?<lb/>
&ldquo;those tall, majestic pines&rdquo;, how grace-<lb/>
-fully &amp; proudly they nod &amp; droop their heads<lb/>
this morning, &amp; how their diamond-bedecked<lb/>
<del>limbs</del> branches sparkle &amp; glitter! Real Christ-<lb/>
mas weather, my darling wifie &amp; husband<lb/>
only hopes that every thing looks as beautiful<lb/>
in Norfolk this blessed 24 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Decr 1879.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01765005"/>
(Page. 5) You will remember, my darling wifie,<lb/>
that my last letter was not a very long one,<lb/>
and it was for the reason that I was in a big<lb/>
hurry, getting ready for a &ldquo;big&rdquo; hunt with Lt.<lb/>
Kingsbury and Cruse, although I did not mention<lb/>
it, at the time- Well, we got away from the Post,<lb/>
about 8 o'clock on Wednesday Morning, and away<lb/>
we hied to &ldquo;Bonito Fork&rdquo;, the scene of our former<lb/>
hunting expedition, on which occasion, the deer we<lb/>
killed &amp; the turkey we slew would not have<lb/>
furnished fresh meat for many. On this oc-<lb/>
casion, however, besides four soldiers &amp; four<lb/>
packers we had 20 of the Indian Company-<lb/>
So that when we arrived at our camp, that af-<lb/>
-ternoon, we found four turkey &amp; a fine big deer<lb/>
already awaiting our &ldquo;molars&rdquo;- We pitched our<lb/>
tent under some beautiful, tall pines very near<lb/>
the stream which, at night, when the moon had arisen,<lb/>
sang us to sleep, as the poets say- The fact is<lb/>
wifie, dear, we didn't require any gentle lullaby<lb/>
to woo the Coy &ldquo;Josephus&rdquo;, to our heavy lids, for<lb/>
twenty miles steady jogging over a rough trail<lb/>
&amp; on a mule, prepared us for a good night's<lb/>
rest- Our little camp looked real pretty at<lb/>
night- we were on the extreme right -- then<lb/>
came our soldiers camp, about 30 feet away<lb/>
&amp; then the packers, &amp; farther still the 20 Indians<lb/>
divided into two camps of 10 each -- so that<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01765006"/>
there were five fires burning brightly, and<lb/>
stretched along in a line about 30 feet apart-<lb/>
we had a good tent for ourselves &amp; one for<lb/>
the soldiers- You should have seen our beds - my<lb/>
darling wifie- Lt. Cruse and I dug a small hole<lb/>
on each side of the tent, large enough to ad-<lb/>
mit our back-bones, &amp; then filled them with<lb/>
long, dry grass which we cut from the<lb/>
Mountain side, thus making a delightfully<lb/>
soft cushion for our bones -- a sort of hair<lb/>
mattress with springs, as it were, over which<lb/>
we spread our blankets- I slept with 4 blank-<lb/>
ets under me, doubled once, &amp; <hi>8 over</hi> me &amp;<lb/>
with my night-cap &amp; a good heavy comfor-<lb/>
ter, which Mrs. Harrison gave me, around my<lb/>
neck, I managed to excude the cold, lovie, dear<lb/>
pretty well- I forgot to say that I had Lt.<lb/>
Kingsbury's dog sleeping on my feet to keep<lb/>
them warm- And pretty cold it was, too, my<lb/>
darling- Next morning, (Thursday) when we got<lb/>
up bright &amp; early we found about 1/2 an<lb/>
inch of ice &amp; the wind<del>s</del> was singing merrily<lb/>
through the trees- The Indians had already<lb/>skipped out for a day's hunt, &amp; while we<lb/>
ate our broiled venison for <del>supper</del> <add>breakfast</add><lb/>
we now &amp; then heard a sharp crack of<lb/>
a rifle, which we knew meant either a<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01765007"/>
turkey or a deer- After breakfast was over,<lb/>
(I am sorry to say, darling, wifie, that I did<lb/>
not wash my face, that morning, for it was<lb/>
<hi>so cold</hi>!) Lt. Cruse &amp; I took our guns &amp; climb-<lb/>
-ed a high hill, which took the breath<lb/>
clean out of us, &amp; then away we<del>n</del> went, tram-<lb/>
-ping over the roughest Country you <hi>almost</hi><lb/>
ever saw, lovie, &amp; we kept our walk till 2 P.M.<lb/>
but we didn't get anything, as the Indians were<lb/>
ahead of us &amp; frightened all the game away.<lb/>
We got back, at 2 P.M. to camp, &amp; <hi>such</hi> a dinner<lb/>
as we two ate, would have supplied a half<lb/>
dozen hungry men- Lt. Cruse is &ldquo;some pump-<lb/>
-kins&rdquo; on eating, &amp; as &ldquo;I wasn't feeling <hi>very</hi><lb/>
well&rdquo;, darling wifie, &amp; besides didn't like to<lb/>
be outdone by a 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Lt., I &ldquo;spec&rdquo; I &ldquo;eat<lb/>
a real <unclear>peart</unclear>&rdquo; quantity of victuals- By the<lb/>
time we had finished our &ldquo;little&rdquo; lunch, the<lb/>
Indians began to come in with their game,<lb/>
&amp; before the sun had sunk beneath the west-<lb/>
-ern horizon, (Hesche!) we counted 13 deer &amp;<lb/>
10 Turkeys, as the result of one day's hunting.<lb/>
I attended to &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; the turkeys -- in fact did<lb/>
it all myself, &amp; Lt. Kingsbury superintended<lb/>
cleaning the deer- Before night we had them<lb/>
all hung up on a rope stretched between<lb/>
two tall pines, &amp; by the light &amp; glimmer of<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f01765008"/>
the camp fire, the display of game was<lb/>
very fine- <hi>We</hi> rather flattered ourselves, that<lb/>
<hi>we</hi> had done very fair work, for <hi>one</hi> day's<lb/>
hunting- That night we slept like &ldquo;tops&rdquo;, each<lb/>
one fairly stupefied with a stomach full of<lb/>
fresh meat- Friday morning, we were up before<lb/>
the stars ceased shining, busy taking down our<lb/>
tent &amp; bundling up our baggage, ready for a<lb/>
day's journey to another branch of Black River,<lb/>
about 7 miles farther away- We were there<lb/>
&amp; in camp by 12 o'clock, noon, &amp; after camp was<lb/>
pitched, we lay off, on our backs, &amp; &ldquo;snoozed&rdquo; &amp;<lb/>
ate -- &amp; sang songs &amp; had a jolly time generally-<lb/>
That afternoon the Indians brought in 5 turkey<lb/>
&amp; 6 deer, &amp; reported that they had left hanging<lb/>
out in the trees, from 5 to 15 miles away, 13<lb/>
more big deer -- so large that they couldn't<lb/>
pack them in on their backs- That night<lb/>
we had a glorious time broiling venison<lb/>
over the hot oak coals- We ate &amp; ate, &amp;<lb/>
yet did not seem to have enough- We held<lb/>
a council of war <add>that night</add> &amp; decided to send in to the<lb/>
Post, next morning, sixteen deer &amp; seventeen<lb/>
Turkeys, as &ldquo;a gentle reminder&rdquo; to the folks<lb/>
at Apache that <hi>we</hi> were, <add>as</add> good hunters<lb/>
as other people. After getting the party off<lb/>
to Apache, early next morning, (Saturday) we<lb/>
started in various directions to get the deer<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f01765009"/>
(Page 9.) that were hanging out- Sam Bow-<lb/>
man &amp; I went out with two pack mules<lb/>
&amp; after travelling about 15 miles over mountains<lb/>
&amp; ca&ntilde;ons, we brought in 4 beautiful deer:- but<lb/>
such a tramp as we had, my darling wife!<lb/>
The Indian who went to show us where the<lb/>
deer were, said it was only &ldquo;poco lejos,&rdquo;<lb/>
that is, &ldquo;a little far&rdquo;- (&ldquo;Dandy-Bill&rdquo;, our old friend,<lb/>
by the way, was the &ldquo;Caballiero&rdquo;,) and I never knew<lb/>
what &ldquo;poco lejos&rdquo; was before, but I <hi>know now-</hi><lb/>
It means about <hi>50</hi> miles for a white man! I<lb/>
was so tired when I got back to camp, that it<lb/>
took about 3 lbs. of venison stew to refresh<del>en</del><lb/>
my drooping spirits! Saturday night, it began<lb/>
to storm &amp; rained hard all night &amp; continued<lb/>
so to do all day Sunday, so that no hunting could<lb/>
be done by the Indians- All day we lay<lb/>
in our tent with a roaring big fire in<lb/>
front &amp; did not dare go out, except for meals,<lb/>
which even the storm could not keep<lb/>
us from. About 4 P.M. on Sunday, I longed<lb/>
very much to get back to Apache, so that I<lb/>
might get my precious wifie's letters &amp; read<lb/>
them, &amp; I had to smother several <hi>real<lb/>
big</hi> sighs, lovie, dear- We concluded that<lb/>
night that our hunt was over as the storm<lb/>
only increased in severity, &amp; <add>we</add> only waited<lb/>
for the return of the pack mules from<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f01765010"/>
Apache, in order to pack up our &ldquo;duds&rdquo; and<lb/>
hie to the Campo- They returned on Monday,<lb/>
too late for a start back on the same day-<lb/>
On Tuesday morning (yesterday), however, we<lb/>
started back to Apache &amp; faced a terrible<lb/>
snow-storm till 2 P.M- The tip of my<lb/>
&ldquo;ittle <unclear>posig</unclear>&rdquo;, lovie, like to have frozen off,<lb/>
but I kept up a brave heart, as I knew<lb/>
that I would find a darling letter awaiting me,<lb/>
&amp; sure enough I did- In all <hi>we</hi> killed 41 deer<lb/>
&amp; 26 Turkeys! This morning, we distributed the<lb/>
game, &amp; now everyone, at the Post, has enough<lb/>
fresh meat for their Christmas dinner- I have<lb/>
not seen either Mrs. Hentig or Mrs. Harrison<lb/>
since I got back -- will call there, to-night-<lb/>
Col. Carr, 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> cav. &amp; Lt. Carter (old &ldquo;good Lord&rdquo;!)<lb/>
will be here on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>- Mrs. Harrison did not<lb/>
get down to Lowell, as she had expected, and is<lb/>
very blue accordingly- Mrs. Hentig is still sick in<lb/>
bed- This letter is written on Wednesday, lovie, &amp; hence<lb/>
I will have to send it by way of Camp<lb/>
Thomas- I hope it will reach my darling in<lb/>
good time- I will send a check, lovie, just as soon<lb/>
as the Paymaster gets here- A thousand happy<lb/>
New Years for my sweet wifie &amp; son- Papa sends<lb/>
<add>a</add> bushel<del>s</del> of love to both of his darlings- 3 pecks for Mama<lb/>
&amp; one peck for son-</p>
