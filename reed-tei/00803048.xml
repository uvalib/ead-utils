<salute>Dear Laura (<hi><unclear>Mrs</unclear></hi> Laura)</salute>
</opener>
<p>We left Guayaquil<lb/>
yester at 5.30 P. M. I will be about 6 days get-<lb/>
ting to Callao - the seaport of Lima. It is a -<lb/>
question if any of us are allowed to land<lb/>
before reaching Callao - i.e. until 6 days<lb/>
have passed since leaving Guayaquil.<lb/>
Possibly the <hi>5</hi> immune to y.f. <add>may do so</add> certainly not the<lb/>
three susceptible to it. We will see the next<lb/>
port at which we touch - <hi><unclear>Eten</unclear></hi>.</p>
<p>The trip is smooth, perfectly so except for the vi-<lb/>
bration of the boat, &amp; the weather is <hi>Cold</hi><lb/>
Whitmore has on an overcoat, as has Gorgas &amp;<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00803049"/>
2<lb/>
I have on my heavy underclothes &amp; my dark<lb/>
suit, &amp; am even with it rather too cool<lb/>
than too warm. Of course the ship's motion<lb/>
make a breeze. And here we are about <hi>6</hi> degrees<lb/>
of the Equator &amp; Panama is 8 1/2 degrees &amp; never<lb/>
under 75&deg; - generally 88&deg; to 92&deg;. It is I am sure<lb/>
as cold as in Baltimore today. This winter<lb/>
in the south is, the Captain tells us, an un-<lb/>
commonly severe one &amp; travel across<lb/>
the Andes - from Santiago <add>to B. Ayres</add> is blocked.</p>
<p>This part is business &amp; is for L. Jr. if she is at<lb/>
home when it arrives.</p>
<p>(1) I want to repeat my request - in the letter<lb/>
from <del>Kingston</del><add>Colon</add>, for Henry (or her) to <del>register</del><lb/>
see about the registry of my address in<lb/>
the Western Union Office. <del>My impression<lb/>
is that</del> It is <hi>possible</hi> that addresses are not<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00803050"/>
C1<lb/>
B20<lb/>
3<lb/>
not allowed to be registered now. At any<lb/>
rate the wireless man on the Almirante<lb/>
said he could not take my message to a<lb/>
code address unless the address had been<lb/>
establised prior to July 1914. If so, there is<lb/>
no reason why my old address<lb/>
&ldquo;<hi>Carterh</hi>&rdquo; - which I registered. I <hi>think</hi> in 1904 or<lb/>
/05 - should not again be brought to their notice<lb/>
It was extant <del>in</del> last fall when I went to Puerto<lb/>
Rico,- although <del>w</del> I was informed when I sent<lb/>
my wireless - before we reached Jamaica<lb/>
that this address was non-existent. Of course<lb/>
notify me of the address registered.</p>
<p><del>If La</del> Our itinary as now determined is<lb/>
as followed. We reach Lima July 12 or 13.<lb/>
The first vessel <add>for the north</add> leaves July 16 or 17, &amp; on it<lb/>
<add>we</add> reach Panama on the 22 or 23, go into<lb/>
quarantine one day &amp; take the S. S. La-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00803051"/>
4<lb/>
La Capa (U. F. Co) on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> for Cartagena. Pos-<lb/>
sibly we may get an Italian or French Liner<lb/>
<del>a day or even</del> two days earlier. <del>We go first</del><lb/>
Then the plans are alternative (a) all go to Bogo-<lb/>
ta, to get the permission of the Central govern-<lb/>
ment, or (b) leave some of us. Myself &amp; Guite-<lb/>
ras <del>at,</del> to work up the Magdalena <unclear>deltu</unclear><lb/>
(Carthagena: Baranquilla &amp; Sabanilla) &amp; Gorgas &amp;<lb/>
the rest go to Bogota-. Then <add>all</add> to <unclear>La Guyra.</unclear> &amp;<lb/>
of course Caraccas first - &amp; back to Maracaito<lb/>
&amp; up to Cucuta - in the interior of Colum-<lb/>
bia. <hi>Then to Barbados &amp; there Catch the<lb/>
<unclear>Lamfort</unclear> &amp; Holt <unclear>Steamer</unclear></hi> for <hi>Rio Janeiro</hi>.<lb/>
Then the east coast of Brazil (Bahia &amp; Pernambu-<lb/>
co &amp; Para) &amp; up the Amazon to Iquitos</p>
<p>Possibly enough we may not have time to<lb/>
make the Brazilian trip- If so we may be<lb/>
able<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00803052"/>
C1<lb/>
B20<lb/>
5<lb/>
able to return to Panama &amp; visit Buenventu-<lb/>
ra &amp; Tumaco, on the west coast of Colum-<lb/>
bia. This is advisable - but not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>I tell this in detail because if L. does not<lb/>
come to Panama to meet us there, she<lb/>
can if she wishes <add>judges it best</add> arrange to come down<lb/>
on the Lamfort &amp; Holt Steamer which we<lb/>
would (or <hi>may</hi>) catch at Barbadoes for<lb/>
Rio. This would be from the latter part of<lb/>
August to the middle or latter part of Sep-<lb/>
tember - I <hi>think</hi> - within 10 days of Sept<lb/>
<hi>10</hi><hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, I would of course cable the name,<lb/>
&amp; date of sailing (from N. Y.) of the Steamer.</p>
<p>I really do not think that we will have <del>time</del><lb/>
to make the Brazilian trip on the leave<lb/>
we have granted; but <del>it is a</del> (1) it is possible<lb/>
that<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f00803053"/>
6<lb/>
we can &amp; (2) we may have the leaves <del>re-<lb/>
added to</del><add>extended</add> - <del>without pay - after one we</del> I can<lb/>
get one more month i.e. to <hi>Oct 20 I think -</hi> with<lb/>
pay, beyond that <del>I can not</del> without pay.</p>
<p><del>T</del> One reason-, the controlling <unclear>one</unclear>, for going by<lb/>
the North Coast - first instead of by the south<lb/>
was the advisability of the <del>M</del> Army men, keep-<lb/>
ing in touch with their their Department. <del>I thi</del><lb/>
I <hi>think</hi> that there will be no war with Mexico - <del>altho</del><lb/>
although Carranza has done his best to bring<lb/>
one on,- yet it is certainly possible even yet.</p>
<p>I am sending an article - from El Grito<lb/>
- the yellowest paper in Ecuador &amp; the most<lb/>
anti-American- Indeed am sending two<lb/>
- are a translation by Juan Guiteras &amp; and <del>are</del><lb/>
coming out later yesterday- This one is bad e-<lb/>
nough - &amp; yet the last paragraph <hi>is</hi> a retrac-<lb/>
tion of the first as far as this Commission is<lb/>
concerned. The Telegrafo - is a paper of far<lb/>
higher.</p>

<p>B(1)</p>
<p>July 8/16</p>
<p>Three more points<lb/>
(1) I rec'd at the hour of leaving Guayaquil - the<lb/>
letters of yourself which I have read many<lb/>
times: of Mary &amp; of Laura. I was the more glad<lb/>
that the latter had returned as you said that you<lb/>
greatly missed her- All were of June 19 &amp; all<lb/>
in one envelope</p>
<p>(2) If Laura meets me in Panama I will<lb/>
from that place - have made out a Power<lb/>
of - attorney for Henry, to sign my name<lb/>
so that he can deposit my service check<lb/>
&amp; draw against my account - by check</p>
<p>(3) There is no necessity for Laura to bring<lb/>
more money than enough to reach her<lb/>
point of meeting us - &amp; a margin to allow<lb/>
for accidents. I will be able if she comes<lb/>
to draw against the Rockefeller Found-<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f00803055"/>

B(2)<lb/>
36<lb/>
Foundation for her expenses. Lyster acts<lb/>
as Treasurer &amp; has exchange drawn in their<lb/>
name, The Foundation owe me to date $<del>579.33</del><add>590.33</add><lb/>
<del>&amp; by the</del> against which I can draw-</p>
<p>- This last <add>information</add> will be of use only if she does<lb/>
not meet <unclear>Ms</unclear> at Panama - but in Barba-<lb/>
does.</p>
<p><del>Lyster estimates</del> Lyster &amp; myself estimate that<lb/>
we will make Barbadoes - from <hi>sept 15</hi> to<lb/>
<hi>Oct 1</hi><hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. Gorgas leave is out Oct 11 (as is Lyster's<lb/>
&amp; Whitmores) so leave would have to be exten-<lb/>
ded if we take the Brazilian work this trip.<lb/>
Whitmore <del>has</del> believes that he <hi>must</hi> return<lb/>
to his position the Army medical school - by Oct 10.</p>
<p>My leave is up - <hi>Sept 20</hi> - but I can get 30 days<lb/>
more with pay. I would <hi>like</hi> to return from<lb/>
<unclear>La Guyra</unclear> &amp; take the Brazils (&amp; Yucatan) next<lb/>
year. However that is in the future</p>
