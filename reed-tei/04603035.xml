Dr. George P. Berry, Dean<lb/>
Harvard Medical School<lb/>
25 Shattuck Street<lb/>
Boston, Massachusetts<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Berry:</salute>
</opener>
<p>We really had a very nice time at the dedication of Camp Lazear and you could<lb/>
not possibly have chosen a better representative than Mr. Caswell. He was of<lb/>
very great help to me as you will read in the enclosed memorandum concerning<lb/>
the dedication of Camp Lazear which I have written essentially as a personal<lb/>
letter to the relatives of those honored. I thought you would like to have a<lb/>
copy. I hope you will find something of interest in it and perhaps some<lb/>
amusing sidelights.</p>
<p>Let me say again that Mr. Caswell gave me a great deal of help which I found<lb/>
I badly needed. I don't know what I would have done without him and <unclear>he and</unclear><lb/>
his good wife practically took over the responsibility of the 13 floral wreaths<lb/>
the morning of the dedication, acting as a most efficient stage director behind<lb/>
the scenes while certain brass hate hold the spotlight.</p>
<p>I enclose some newspaper clippings which will show you, I hope, something of<lb/>
the very sympathetic response of the Cuban people. It was extremely ap-<lb/>
propriate that the Americans should have participated. General Wood's<lb/>
daughter was the guest of honor and seems to have had a grand though very<lb/>
busy time.</p>
<p>Two or three photographs of Mr. Caswell laying the Harvard wreath before<lb/>
General Wood's plaque were taken by news photographers. I was given copies<lb/>
but Doctor Nogueira expected to borrow the films and send them to me shortly<lb/>
in case you should wish to use one in connection with a little write up of<lb/>
the affair in a Harvard medical or alumni bulletin. Thank you again very<lb/>
sincerely for participating in this affair. Your participation was very<lb/>
important.</p>
<p>The cost of each wreath was $15. They were really very lovely and would have<lb/>
cost two or three times that much here. They were purchased from &ldquo;Milagros<lb/>
Flores,&rdquo; Lucila Schumann, President, who gave me only one bill itemizing<lb/>
each wreath and institutional donor. If you need an ozalid copy I can send<lb/>
it. Otherwise I should be glad to receive a check for $15 at your convenience.</p>
