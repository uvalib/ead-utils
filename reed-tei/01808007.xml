Colonel Charles H. Alden,<lb/>
Assistant Surgeon General, U.S. Army.<lb/>

Sir:<lb/>
</p>
<p>I have the honor to communicate to you, in compliance with<lb/>
paragraph 18, S. O. 192, A.G.O. August 22, 1893, the following special<lb/>
instructions concerning the examination of Captain Walter Reed.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f01808010"/>
<p>assistant surgeon. for promotion to the grade of surgeon:</p>
<p>The physical examination should be thorough in character.</p>
<p>The professional examination will be confined to such clinical<lb/>
experience as Captain Reed may have had since the date of his last<lb/>
examination; due credit being given to the fact that he has already<lb/>
passed successfully that examination.</p>
<p>Written questions and answers are not deemed necessary, but<lb/>
the report of the Board should set forth briefly the separate clinical<lb/>
items upon which the examination was based.</p>
<p>I enclose herewith the Personal History of Captain Reed, and<lb/>
an extract from the Merit Roll of candidates found qualified by the<lb/>
Army Medical Board at the time of his admission to the Medical Corps.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,<lb/>
[Signed] Geo. M. Sternberg,<lb/>
Surgeon General, U.S. Army.<lb/>
</p>
<p>under which special instructions the examination was conducted.</p>
<p>The following Papers from the Records of the Surgeon General's<lb/>
Office were submitted, viz:</p>
<p>Merit Roll of candidate at examination for admission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Record of services, and efficiency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>which were read and considered by the Board.</p>
<p>Captain Reed having signed the required certificate as follows:<lb/>
viz:</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>September 9, 1893.</p>
<p>I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I am<lb/>
not suffering from any disease or disability which, in any way, in-<lb/>
capacitates me from performing my duties as a medical officer of the<lb/>
Army.</p>
<p>[Signed] Walter Reed.<lb/>
Captain and Asst. Surgeon, U. S. Army.</p>
<pb n="5" id="f01808011"/>
<p>the original of which is hereto appended marked &ldquo;A&rdquo;, the Board pro-<lb/>
ceeded with the physical examination of Captain Reed and finds as<lb/>
follows:</p>
<p>Vision, R. 20&sol;xxx . L. 20&sol;xx .</p>
<p>Slight Myopia and Astigmatism, right eye.<lb/>
Hearing, normal.<lb/>
Analysis of Urine.<lb/>
Reaction, acid.<lb/>
Specific Gravity, 1015.<lb/>
Albumen, none.<lb/>
Sugar, none.</p>
<p>Having found his physical condition satisfactory, the Board<lb/>
then proceeded to examine the candidate upon his clinical experiences.<lb/>
The subjects covered were:</p>
<p>Typhoid Fever.<lb/>
Pneumonia.<lb/>
Tuberculosis.<lb/>
Gun Shot Wounds.<lb/>
Antiseptic precautions in Surgical<lb/>
Operations.<lb/>

qualifications to perform efficiently all the duties of the grade to<lb/>
which he will next be eligible and recommend his promotion thereto.</p>
