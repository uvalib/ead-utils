<p>Hench suggests to Halverson that a representative of the American Public Health Association place one or two wreaths during the dedication ceremonies of Camp Lazear, or send a message if no one attends. If Halverson has not received an invitation, Hench would be glad to suggest discreetly that he be invited.</p>

Dr. Wilton L. Halverson, President<lb/>
American Public Health Association<lb/>
760 Market Street<lb/>
San Francisco, 2, California<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Halverson:</salute>
</opener>
<p>You may have heard that the Cuban Government has made a little park at<lb/>
Walter Reed's Camp Lazear outside of Havana and are dedicating it to<lb/>
the glories of Doctor Finlay, Major Reed and their colleagues on Decem-<lb/>
ber 3, Finlay's birthday which is &ldquo;Physicians' Day in Cuba.&rdquo; Although<lb/>
Doctor Finlay will receive perhaps the major share of honors, nonetheless<lb/>
this is a very gracious gesture on the part of the Cubans for this is the<lb/>
first time they have ever honored Major Reed. I understand they propose<lb/>
to maintain the name Camp Lazear and that Reed's Building No. 1 will re-<lb/>
tain its name also.</p>
<p>I believe that you and/or some of your associates will receive official<lb/>
invitations to the affair, at least I hope so. The Surgeon General has<lb/>
appointed General Paul H. Streit, Commanding General of Walter Reed<lb/>
Hospital, as his official representative. The Mayo Foundation is sending<lb/>
me as its representative. The ceremony will probably be a modest one in<lb/>
view of the humble nature of Camp Lazear, but nevertheless it will be one<lb/>
of real significance.</p>
<p>There seems to have been some delay in sending invitations from Cuba. This<lb/>
was related to the uncertainty as to the date when the little memorial would<lb/>
be dedicated. Already the date has been postponed at least once. If you<lb/>
have not received an invitation, I would appreciate it if you would let me<lb/>
know and I will discreetly make the proper suggestions at once. In view of<lb/>
the outstanding contributions of Dr. Carlos Finlay and Walter Reed and his<lb/>
colleagues to sanitation, I do believe that you and your associates would<lb/>
be glad to know of this affair and, if possible, participate in it in some<lb/>
way.</p>
<p>Doctor Halverson, I have suggested that the few Americans who attend the<lb/>
ceremony should not go empty-handed but should make some friendly gesture.<lb/>
Therefore the Mayo Foundation has authorized me to place a wreath under<lb/>
the medallion of Doctor Finlay and it may be that The Surgeon General's<lb/>
representative and/or the deans of the four or five medical schools from<lb/>
which Doctor Finlay, Major Reed and the others received their degrees, may<lb/>
present wreaths, or at least send wires expressing the interest and ap-<lb/>
preciation of the American Medical profession in this gracious gesture by<lb/>
which the Cuban Government and people are honoring not only Doctor Finlay<lb/>
but Walter Reed and their American colleagues.</p>

<p>November 21, 1952</p>
<p>May I make this suggestion for what it is worth and you can act on it as<lb/>
you see fit. If you should decide to send a wire or message, it could be<lb/>
sent to Dr. Jose Andreu, El Ministro de Salubridad y Asistencia Social,<lb/>
Havana, to Dr. Pedro Nogueira, Marti 219, Marianao, Havana, or to Dr.<lb/>
Cesar Rodriguez Exposito, Secretary, Marti 219, Marianao, Havana. Should<lb/>
you prefer to place one or two wreaths during the ceremony, I should be<lb/>
glad to let you know what arrangements I am making along that line regarding<lb/>
the wreath from the Mayo Foundation.</p>
