</opener>
<p>The dear,<lb/>
little message that I had been<lb/>
expecting since Monday came<lb/>
safely into my hands, this<lb/>
morning, and dispelled my anx-<lb/>
iety- I had begun to fear that<lb/>
you were sick, but since I<lb/>
find that you have recovered<lb/>
your health and strength suf-<lb/>
ficiently to assist at a Christ-<lb/>
mas Tree, I am so much re-<lb/>
lieved and rejoiced that I can<lb/>
afford to wait 2 or 3 days for<lb/>
my letter. Bless your little<lb/>
heart! I forgive you? That<lb/>
I will with all my heart!<lb/>
and will tell you that you<lb/>
are the dearest, sweetest<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01673002"/>
girl alive! Ain't it so? If you don't agree<lb/>
with me, I am very sorry, but nevertheless,<lb/>
I will remain of the same opinion still-<lb/>
All of your work came during Christmas,<lb/>
but mine has come since &amp; for the past 2<lb/>
days has kept me <add>as</add> busy as a bee- Don't get<lb/>
frightened when I tell you that we have<lb/>
two cases of Small-Pox on the Post-- Besides<lb/>
these, there are some few sick children that<lb/>
I must attend to-- Oh! the responsibility of<lb/>
a physician! Did                                                                                                                                                                                           you ever think of it, my<lb/>
darling E.? And though you have, you<lb/>
can form no idea of the anxiety, the <hi>gnawing</hi><lb/>
anxiety, that burdens a physician's mind!<lb/>
I sometimes wonder why this did not<lb/>
occur to me when I first began my<lb/>
Profession (but then I was a boy &amp; did not<lb/>
trouble my mind with thinking) yet<lb/>
had I then known what I now know, med-<lb/>
icine would have been my last choice.<lb/>
Not that I do not like my profession; far<lb/>
from that- But, Oh! to stand by, as it were,<lb/>
with your hands tied, unable to render<lb/>
any assistance, &amp; with anxious parents<lb/>
&amp; friends begging you to stay the destroy-<lb/>
er; this is well nigh unendurable!<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01673003"/>
I am afraid that I am too sympathetic,<lb/>
but Heaven knows such is my nature;<lb/>
and I cannot be otherwise- I had rather<lb/>
err on the side of sympathy than to have<lb/>
none at all- I did not intend to say so<lb/>
much on the subject when I began, &amp; must<lb/>
beg your pardon- You did not say whether<lb/>
the volume had arrived or not- I do trust that<lb/>
it was not delayed in any way, &amp; yet it would<lb/>
be just my fortune- Please, when you next<lb/>
write, just mention whether you have received<lb/>
it or not. so that if not, I may make some in-<lb/>
quiry about it- I trust, however, that it has<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01673004"/>
come to hand e're this, and<lb/>
you have been enabled<lb/>
to pass an hour pleasant-<lb/>
ly over its pages- In a<lb/>
former letter, I said that I<lb/>
had some questions to ask<lb/>
concerning dear old Mur-<lb/>
freesboro- You don't get mad<lb/>
because I call it <hi>old</hi>, do<lb/>
you? I am sure, my dar-<lb/>
ling, that it is beautiful<lb/>
in its old age, &amp; that it is<lb/>
each year becoming more<lb/>
charming- When I say &ldquo;old&rdquo;,<lb/>
I mean somewhere between<lb/>
1 and 100- Isn't there latitude<lb/>
enough? I would say the<lb/>
same concerning myself-<lb/>
Well, I want to know what<lb/>
has become of that wonder-<lb/>
ful newspaper that was<lb/>
to flood the land with<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01673005"/>
intelligence, &amp; make Hert-<lb/>
ford (I believe that is the<lb/>
county) blossom like the<lb/>
rose! I would put the last<lb/>
four words in quotation<lb/>
marks, but I don't know wheth-<lb/>
er I have quoted them cor-<lb/>
rectly or not- Indeed, my dar-<lb/>
ling <del>u</del>, if you <add>will</add> permit me to<lb/>
to fly off at a tangent, I'll<lb/>
tell you, that I have, recently,<lb/>
so deserted the poets, that<lb/>
I would hesitate to attempt<lb/>
any quotation (provided any<lb/>
poet ever made use of the<lb/>
said words, which I think is<lb/>
far from probable.) To re-<lb/>
turn- Has the paper <del>been</del> star-<lb/>
ted into life? I should think<lb/>
that with two such large<lb/>
editors it ought to suc-<lb/>
ceed- If it has not been<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01673006"/>
&ldquo;gathered in&rdquo; before I come<lb/>
down, I think I will have to sub-<lb/>
scribe for a copy-</p>
<p>In the next place, I desire to<lb/>
know whether you have yet<lb/>
made the acquaintance of my old friend (and here I<lb/>
mean <hi>old</hi>) Miss, Bert Peace?<lb/>
My sister writes me that<lb/>
Miss Peace is very much<lb/>
pleased with Murfreesboro,<lb/>
and I am sure, <del>if</del> <add>when</add> she makes<lb/>
<hi>your</hi> acquaintance, my little<lb/>
Sweetheart, she will be more<lb/>
than charmed-, &amp; until she<lb/>
does form your acquaintance,<lb/>
she will have neglected the<lb/>
greatest attraction that<lb/>
the town possesses.</p>
<p>Do you ever catch a glympse<lb/>
of my friend Sharpe, or does<lb/>
he stay in his shell so<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01673007"/>
close that he is not<lb/>
at all visible? You must<lb/>
remember that I left you<lb/>
under his special care-<lb/>
You were not aware, per-<lb/>
haps, that you were provi-<lb/>
ded with so watchful and<lb/>
gallant a protector-!</p>
<p>There are other questions yet<lb/>
to be propounded, but as my paper<lb/>
is almost exhausted, I will post-<lb/>
pone those to another time-</p>
<p>Good Night, my sweet E.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, as ever,<lb/>
your own fond &amp;<lb/>
devoted</salute>
