<salute>My dear Senora Rojas:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I cannot tell you how very pleased I was to receive the cable from you,<lb/>

and all the good members of your family, at Washington Pennsylvania. It was indeed<lb/>
a thoughtful gesture on your part.</p>
<p>The dedication of the Lazear Memorial Building was very fine. The ceremony<lb/>
was most dignified and impressive, and the building is a beautiful one. There was<lb/>
quite a crowd there, and my talk at the banquet Saturday evening was most sympathetically<lb/>
received. Three relatives of Dr. Lazear were present and were so interested in all<lb/>
that I had to say. I have also heard from Mrs. Lazear, who expressed a great interest<lb/>
in all that was done, including the discovery of Camp Lazear. I am sending you a<lb/>
clipping from the local paper. I am leaving tomorrow on a medical speaking trip for<lb/>
about ten days, and as soon as I can, I wish to have my paper submitted for publica-<lb/>
tion in a medical journal. There will be no trouble at all in having it accepted<lb/>
and I will see that you and your relatives have reprints as a permanent memorandum.<lb/>
Several present were most interested in my little campaign to purchase the building<lb/>
and memorialize the various sites involved, and I am sure that we can conclude this<lb/>
venture successfully. On my return, I will write you further details of this plan.</p>
<p>General Kean (the Major Kean mentioned in your husband's day book) was de-<lb/>
lighted with our discovery and most interested to know of your finding of the records.<lb/>
That is practically the last proof that we need except that I asked Mr. Moran to get<lb/>
a photostatic copy of Mr. Zunzunegei's 1907 contract and also of the previous contract<lb/>
made before the two little wooden buildings were mentioned.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hench and I send to you and yours our very warmest greetings.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Hastily but very sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>P. S. Hench, M. D.</signed>
