<salute>Dear General Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have been back in S.F. for a<lb/>
week and am just catching up on<lb/>
loose ends and things that had to be<lb/>
done. What a grand trip of 3 months &amp;<lb/>
had! It was marvelous! It was so<lb/>
nice to see so many old friends and<lb/>
to accomplish so much. Of course<lb/>
getting an appointment for Jack and<lb/>
then taking him to New York and putting<lb/>
him and the other boys (including your grandson)<lb/>
on the <unclear>Wechaushen</unclear> Ferry on July 1, was the<lb/>
big achievement.</p>
<p>Your letter of Aug 9, with the<lb/>
<hi>Introduction</hi> came yesterday and I<lb/>
can't tell you how much I like it.<lb/>
The past about Dr. Hench pleased me<lb/>
very much and I agree with you<lb/>
that your statements bring out just<lb/>
what happened and that they will add<lb/>
very greatly to value of my story.</p>
<p>I did not fully understand Dr. H.<lb/>
until I met him in Washington and<lb/>
had a short but most interesting<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06310138"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
2<lb/>
visit with him. I learned about<lb/>
him and I feel sure he looked me<lb/>
over thoroughly. He had a right to<lb/>
do that, for I had flooded him with<lb/>
so many things in our correspondence<lb/>
that were contrary to what he had heard<lb/>
elsewhere that it was only natural<lb/>
that he should want to see if I had<lb/>
both feet on the ground. I am anxious<lb/>
to have him come out here sometime<lb/>
where I can have a good long<lb/>
visit with him. I also had a<lb/>
very good visit <add>in July</add> with Laura Wood in<lb/>
her apartment in Rittenhouse Square<lb/>
in Phila. Before I left she said<lb/>
she would have to modify some of her<del>e</del><lb/>
statements in her book which conflicted<lb/>
with my views. So she believes in<lb/>
me too and that was pleasing. You<lb/>
had the advantage over me in<lb/>
knowing them both before you began<lb/>
to give them information, so they know<lb/>
from the start that you were giving<lb/>
them real, trustworthy information.</p>
<p>But to go back to the Introduction. You<lb/>
have brought out the very things I<lb/>
felt were necessary and done it in<lb/>

such a splendid way, that I am most<lb/>
grateful. There is nothing I can<lb/>
add and certainly nothing I want<lb/>
to delete. I will send you a typed<lb/>
copy soon. Many thanks.</p>
<p>I am glad you have seen Siler and<lb/>
that he showed you the correspondence<lb/>
re the nomenclature re. mosquitoes. In<lb/>
time I will have a chance to make the<lb/>
necessary conditions. Siler turned<lb/>
the Mrs. over to Col. Rogers, but I have<lb/>
not heard from the latter. In the meantime<lb/>
I have a letter from Harper's, who have<lb/>
taken over Paul B. <unclear>Hoeber's</unclear> publications,<lb/>
stating that &ldquo;We like your manuscript<lb/>
very much and we hope it will be possible<lb/>
for us to make you an offer of publication&rdquo;<lb/>
They want to know how many copies the<lb/>
S.G. would buy for the army. I have told<lb/>
them that the S.G. has the revised copy (they<lb/>
have an uncorrected carbon which has been<lb/>
with F.F. Russell and Mahlon Ashford since<lb/>
it was finished (Dec. 7,41) and that I will advise<lb/>
them in due time. When I hear from Rogers<lb/>
I think it will be time enough to tell them.</p>

<p>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
I have not forgotten your request<lb/>
to send you a snap shot of Barbara<lb/>
&amp; her baby. I am inclosing a group<lb/>
taken at the La Gorde's home on June 29,<lb/>
at the time the baby was christened.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;plebes&rdquo; are at Pine Camp and from<lb/>
newspaper reports they are getting a very<lb/>
real workout. We have had but few<lb/>
letters from Jack for he has little time<lb/>
to write. He is deeply interested and<lb/>
is enjoying the military work. He says<lb/>
that he gets awfully tired but that he<lb/>
can take it. He sees but few of his<lb/>
friends as they have but few contacts<lb/>
with any boys except those of their own<lb/>
Company. He is in the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Company.</p>
<p>It is windy, foggy and cold out<lb/>
here. August is our most month<lb/>
in that respect but after all it is better<lb/>
than Washington at this time of year.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my visits with<lb/>
you &amp; Cornelia and Mrs Truby joins<lb/>
me in love to you both.</p>
