<p>How<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Yellow Fever</hi><lb/>
Was Conquered</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>YELLOW FEVER is one of the<lb/>
most deadly diseases. It is<lb/>
peculiar to tropical America. It<lb/>
existed continually in Havana<lb/>
and from there it frequently in-<lb/>
vaded the United States, sometimes as far<lb/>
north as Boston. In 1878, an epidemic of<lb/>
yellow fever in the southern cities resulted<lb/>
in 16,000 deaths and an economic loss esti-<lb/>
mated at $100,000,000.</p>
<p>After the close of the Spanish-American<lb/>
War, yellow fever broke out among the<lb/>
American soldiers in Havana. A commission<lb/>
to investigate its cause and transmission was<lb/>
appointed, consisting of Major Walter Reed,<lb/>
Dr. James Carroll, Dr. J. W. Lazear and<lb/>
Dr. Aristides Agramonte.</p>
<p>Major Reed decided first of all to investi-<lb/>
gate a theory, advanced twenty years before,<lb/>
by Dr. Carlos H. Finlay that the disease was<lb/>
transmitted by mosquitoes. The only way<lb/>
of proving or disproving this theory was by<lb/>
experimentation. At that time the lower<lb/></p>
<pb n="2" id="f03142012"/>
<p>AC<lb/>
N<unclear>P</unclear><lb/>
animals were thought to be immune to yellow<lb/>
fever, so if experiments were to be tried at<lb/>
all, they must be on human beings. Volun-<lb/>
teers were called for and the Commissioners<lb/>
insisted that they themselves should be in-<lb/>
cluded. Every man knew that he was likely<lb/>
to die, but he also knew that the experiment<lb/>
might save thousands of his fellow men from<lb/>
death. The volunteers permitted themselves<lb/>
to be bitten by mosquitoes which had previ-<lb/>
ously bitten yellow fever patients. Lazear<lb/>
was the first to apply supposedly infected<lb/>
mosquitoes to himself but the results were<lb/>
negative. Later he was exposed to a con-<lb/>
taminated mosquito, unintentionally, and died<lb/>
in convulsions. Carroll almost died; for<lb/>
three days his life hung in the balance. The<lb/>
experiment was continued on eleven men, and<lb/>
as two of them contracted yellow fever, Reed<lb/>
felt justified in saying that the disease was<lb/>
carried by mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Many, however, were not convinced, and<lb/>
Reed and his associates decided to repeat the<lb/>
experiments under conditions which would<lb/>
leave no doubt. In a lonely place, a mile<lb/>
from the nearest habitations, they established<lb/>
an experiment station, and placed an armed<lb/>
guard around it. It was named Camp La-<lb/>
zear. An immune hospital steward brought<lb/>
supplies from Camp Columbia but no other<lb/>
intercourse with the town was permitted.</p>
<p>The first volunteer to be bitten by con-<lb/>
taminated mosquitoes was John R. Kissinger,<lb/>
who developed a typical case of yellow fever,<lb/>
from which he later recovered. This showed<lb/>
that the disease can be transmitted by the<lb/>
mosquito.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f03142013"/>

<p>To find out whether the disease can be<lb/>
acquired by contact with contaminated ob-<lb/>
jects, more volunteers submitted to a series<lb/>
of most unpleasant experiences, in the course<lb/>
of which they were exposed to the soiled<lb/>
clothing and bedding used by men who had<lb/>
died of yellow-fever. It was thus shown<lb/>
that contaminated clothing and other objects<lb/>
can not transmit the disease.</p>
<p>In another experiment, a small frame<lb/>
building was put up and screened to prevent<lb/>
mosquitoes from getting in or out. The in-<lb/>
terior was divided into two unequal compart-<lb/>
ments, separated by wire mosquito netting.<lb/>
Two susceptible men were put into one side<lb/>
of this building and one into the other com-<lb/>
partment. There they remained for several<lb/>
days, subjected in every way to exactly the<lb/>
same conditions. When they had lived there<lb/>
in good health long enough to prove that<lb/>
they were not infected, Reed put fifteen con-<lb/>
taminated mosquitoes into one of the com-<lb/>
partments and declared that compartment to<lb/>
be infected. The man in this infected com-<lb/>
partment was bitten by mosquitoes several<lb/>
times and in four days came down with yel-<lb/>
low fever. Meanwhile the two men living<lb/>
in the other compartment, breathing the same<lb/>
air, remained perfectly well.</p>
<p>Reed, after simply removing the fifteen<lb/>
mosquitoes, declared the infected compart-<lb/>
ment disinfected. A non-immune soldier was<lb/>
then placed in each compartment and the<lb/>
two remained perfectly well for several days.</p>
<p>There followed a vigorous war upon mos-<lb/>
quitoes. They were killed by fumigation and<lb/>
their breeding places were sought out and</p>
<pb n="4" id="f03142014"/>
<p>destroyed. In seven months, Havana was<lb/>
free from yellow fever for the first time<lb/>
since 1763, when yellow fever had become<lb/>
continuously present in the region.</p>
<p>A few years later, General William C.<lb/>
Gorgas started a similar campaign in the<lb/>
Panama Canal Zone and within twelve<lb/>
months abolished yellow fever there and<lb/>
made possible the building of the Panama<lb/>
Canal. This deadly disease with a few<lb/>
others had cost the French 22,189 human<lb/>
lives--one of the chief reasons why the<lb/>
French abandoned the canal project.</p>
<p>Who will say that too high a price was<lb/>
paid for this enormous saving of life? Who<lb/>
will say that these men should not have<lb/>
risked their lives to save millions from suffer-<lb/>
ing and death? If we honor the soldier who<lb/>
dies to save his company--a wounded com-<lb/>
rade perhaps--how shall we honor Lazear,<lb/>
who died to save a hundred thousand men?<lb/>
There is a modest tablet to his memory in<lb/>
Johns Hopkins University, and a great hos-<lb/>
pital in Washington bears the name of<lb/>
Walter Reed. But the service they rendered<lb/>
to humanity is beyond estimate and beyond<lb/>
reward.</p>
<p>If the bodies of men like this are not too<lb/>
sacred to dedicate to such work as they per-<lb/>
formed, is it too much to ask that the bodies<lb/>
of a few rats or rabbits or guinea pigs shall<lb/>
be dedicated to work of equal importance?</p>
