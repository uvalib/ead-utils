<p>GUST E. LAMBERT - - Yellow Fever Nurse</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>No one reads much about Lambert, the most successful and<lb/>
experienced of all yellow fever nurses, except that he was<lb/>
termed, &ldquo;Doctor Ames' Man Friday,&rdquo; which was an apt appel-<lb/>
lation, and Ames, thought highly of him.</p>
<p>At that time he was about 25 years of age, of athletic build<lb/>
and exceptionally strong. He had been a seaman on sailing<lb/>
ships from the age of 12, uneducated, but quick to learn.<lb/>
Despite a rough, tough life all over the world as seaman and<lb/>
later as a high steel construction worker, he had a decided<lb/>
religious streak.--Never swore, drank, or lied. But he was<lb/>
a tough Swede who gained his manhood, according to the<lb/>
Scandinavian deep-sea law, at the age of 17, aboard ship,<lb/>
when in a bloody fight disabled a man older and bigger than<lb/>
himself, who had abused him. --A man who had 13 teeth pulled<lb/>
refusing all <del>an</del> anesthetic, yet he was a kind and gentle<lb/>
nurse.</p>
<p>Doctor Ames was his ideal.--The man who had taught him yel-<lb/>
low fever nursing from post-mortem back to diagnosis. He<lb/>
became the ideal nurse. Obeyed orders implicitly and could<lb/>
handle the strongest patient gently and easily.--No strug-<lb/>
gling, which often brought on black-vomit. A man who stayed<lb/>
with his patients, constantly on duty, with no comforts or<lb/>
relief.</p>
<p>He became indispensible to Ames. After handling over 67<lb/>
cases of <del>u</del><add>y</add>ellow fever he had learned to see t<del>o</del><add>he</add> fever as an<lb/>
old nurse can see death, by a sixth sense.</p>
<p>This he once proved when Doctor Ames came to the yellow<lb/>
fever ward one evening and asked him for a drin<del>g</del><add>k</add> of whiskey,<lb/>
saying he thought he had malaria. Lambert knew that Ames<lb/>
did not drink strong liquor, so he looked at him intently,<lb/>
surprised, and told him, &ldquo;You have yellow fever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&check; Ames said that was not possible. But Lambert insisted, and<lb/>
with tears running down his cheeks, forced Ames to undergo<lb/>
the preliminary treatment for that disease. Ames knew that<lb/>
Lambert was so much in earnest that he dare not resist him.<lb/>
&check; Next morning test showed no malaria and later on Captain<lb/>
Stark diagnos<del>i</del>sed it as yellow fever.</p>
<p>I can still remember Lambert stuck in that fever section,<lb/>
&check; in the <hi>miserable shacks</hi> before and until completion of the<lb/>
experiments, eight months alone, nursing successfully all<lb/>
those patients. Treated as an outcast, no one allowed near<lb/>
him but the doctor; he allowed to go near no other, while<lb/>
just across the cut he could see his fellow corpsmen enjoy-<lb/>
ing a normal life. His uniform,-pajamas and slippers and<lb/>
not even a chance to wash them--burned them and used new<lb/>
ones.</p>
<p>Perhaps he did not know; perhaps he did, but he would never<lb/>
have been compelled to remain all that time on a dangerous<lb/>
job if he had protested. I well know that yellow fever<lb/>
nursing in Cuba was in most cases that of volunteering. No<lb/>
one was detailed to nurse that disease against his will.</p>
