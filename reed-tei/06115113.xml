<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Here I am back again.</p>
<p>1st - I talked to Blossom this morning and asked her if she<lb/>
would drop you a note saying it was all right with her if you<lb/>
let me see her copy of Reed's letters. She said she was too<lb/>
confused and busy to write a note, but I should write you my-<lb/>
self, give you her love (she has quite a crush on you), say<lb/>
Granny is sick still and that the cook has left and that she<lb/>
is trying to feed the nurses and get organized to go to the<lb/>
country and that it will be perfectly all right with her if<lb/>
you let me see the copy of the letters that you have. I said<lb/>
you were a punctilious fellow and would rather have it in her<lb/>
own writing, but I couldn't press it very well, esp. as I<lb/>
imagine she's rather rattled by the domestic problems of which<lb/>
she spoke very feelingly. Do you suppose that that is explicit<lb/>
enough permission? As you know, I want to see them principally<lb/>
so that I can say I've had access to unpublished letters, and<lb/>
positively do not want to quote them in any way.</p>
<p>2nd - Kelly tells, on page 10 of the 2nd edition, a story about<lb/>
Reed and a <unclear>Bklyn</unclear> doctor who came to him when he was Health In-<lb/>
spector to report the death of a child. He couldn't even de-<lb/>
scribe symptoms properly, and when Reed said &ldquo;It must have been<lb/>
...,&rdquo;  mentioning a disease with a Latin name, the other<lb/>
dr said, &ldquo;Yes it must have been ...&rdquo; and mispronounced the name.<lb/>
My problem is, what could the disease have been: a children's<lb/>
disease with a Latin name, prevalent in 1875, not too common or<lb/>
even a bum doctor would have recognized it probably, and on the<lb/>
other hand not too exotic. Gen Kean suggested status lymphati-<lb/>
cus, but another dr when I  mentioned it howled and said<lb/>
status lymphaticus was almost a medical joke -  something<lb/>
to which poor drs attributed death when they couldn't figure<lb/>
out the real cause. Can you think of a better one? Or should<lb/>
I let it go at that? I'd rather not make a boner if I can help<lb/>
it.</p>
<p>Now we are going to move Monday or Tuesday, and everything is<lb/>
getting to look more disconsolate and depressing here by the<lb/>
minute. So, when you find time to write me next, it had better<lb/>
be at the Philadelphia address.</p>
<p>I'm glad you're looking forward with such zest to the illustra-<lb/>
tions. I'm asking all my friends to buy the book but please<lb/>
not read it. I don't mind if they look at the pictures, though.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
