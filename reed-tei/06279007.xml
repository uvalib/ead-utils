<salute>My dear Truby</salute>

<p>I dont believe I<lb/>
have yet written to <unclear>thank</unclear><lb/>
you for the copy of Walter<lb/>
Reeds letter to you of Dec.<lb/>
10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1900 and for your<lb/>
good letter of April <del>3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi></del><add>27/36?</add><lb/>
It is a letter of great<lb/>
value &amp; interest- I wish<lb/>
I had had a copy of<lb/>
it to send to Burton<lb/>
Hendrick<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06279008"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
2<lb/>
where in 1924 he and Mrs<lb/>
Gorgas published their life<lb/>
of Gorgas and made the<lb/>
astonishing statement that<lb/>
Reed when he discovered<lb/>
that mosquitos could carry<lb/>
yellow fever didnt know<lb/>
what to do about it or how<lb/>
to attack them and that<lb/>
Gorgas was the real dis-<lb/>
coverer when he found out<lb/>
by his mosquito work in<lb/>
Havana in the spring &amp;<lb/>
summer of 1901 that the<lb/>
mosquito prevention did<lb/>
actually put an end to<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06279009"/>
its prevalence in Havana!<lb/>
It still makes me angry<lb/>
to think of Hendrick doing<lb/>
this when I had called<lb/>
his attention to Reed's letter<lb/>
to Dr L. O. Howard and<lb/>
other evidence including<lb/>
Reeds conclusions in his<lb/>
address to the Pan American<lb/>
Med. Congress in Havana<lb/>
Feb. 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1901- I sent him<lb/>
all the evidence in the spring<lb/>
of 1924 when he published a<lb/>
preliminary chapter in the<lb/>
magazine the outwork I think<lb/>
months before the book appeared<lb/>
But it would have spoiled his<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06279010"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
4<lb/>
story &amp; made a lot of work<lb/>
so he thought he would risk<lb/>
it- Then Ireland made me<lb/>
write the review of the book<lb/>
which was published in<lb/>
the Mil. Surgeon March 1925-<lb/>
This &amp; the reprints had a<lb/>
wide circulation &amp; killed<lb/>
the sale of the book. Hen-<lb/>
drick soon sold his share<lb/>
in it &amp; it <unclear>slid</unclear> quickly into<lb/>
the oblivion which it deserved<lb/>
tho. it was well written &amp;<lb/>
interesting- The trouble with<lb/>
Hendrick was that he was a<lb/>
newspaper man who thought<lb/>
the story was more <unclear>important</unclear><lb/>

than the truth- Mrs Gorgas's<lb/>
conscience hurt her but she<lb/>
was blinded by adulation<lb/>
and the glare of publicity<lb/>
well I have gone a long way<lb/>
from where I started-</p>
<p>Ireland who never forgets<lb/>
friends asked me to go with<lb/>
him to call on poor old<lb/>
Col. Coe, as he does about<lb/>
once a month- The old old<lb/>
fellow lives in the past<lb/>
and is entirely forgotten by<lb/>
most of his former friends and<lb/>
lives on these visits of Irelands<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06279012"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
6<lb/>
Ireland arranged that on<lb/>
his 80<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> birthday Gen Reynolds<lb/>
would call on him with us<lb/>
and Gen R. sent him a<lb/>
five official letter of con-<lb/>
gratulations &amp; wrote me for<lb/>
the Chief of Staff to send-<lb/>
It made a happy day<lb/>
for the old man who now<lb/>
can hardly read at all-<lb/>
I can beat him at that<lb/>
game for now I can read<lb/>
good point (not newspapers)<lb/>
with the help of a strong<lb/>
hand glass- I have just fin-<lb/>
ished reading The Seven <unclear>Pit-<lb/>
lor</unclear> of wisdom by Lawrence<lb/>
of Arabia in a beautiful<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06279013"/>
7<lb/>
edition with fine large<lb/>
print with which I got<lb/>
along very well- I dont<lb/>
think the obscuring band<lb/>
across my pupil has been<lb/>
absorbed to any extent<lb/>
but I have learned a<lb/>
good deal by practice<lb/>
in holding the focus of<lb/>
my strong lens so I<lb/>
get on much better as<lb/>
far as reading is con-<lb/>
cerned-</p>
<p>To go back to Walter Reed<lb/>
I have had several letters<lb/>
from Moran in Havana<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06279014"/>
AC<lb/>
T<lb/>
8<lb/>
inclosing articles from the<lb/>
newspaper El Mundo<lb/>
saying that the &ldquo;Yanke's&rdquo;<lb/>
rob Finlay of the credit that<lb/>
belongs to him by always<lb/>
talking of Reed &amp; Gorgas<lb/>
and failing to <unclear>mention</unclear><lb/>
Finlay- There is a certain<lb/>
amount of the truth in that<lb/>
Finlay, and Guiteras pointed<lb/>
out in his speech at the dinner<lb/>
given to Finlay at which<lb/>
Gen. Wood, Reed Gorgas &amp; I<lb/>
were present did the same<lb/>
role for Y. F. <add>as legands Reed</add> that Manson<lb/>
did <unclear>apropros</unclear> of Ronald Ross- We<lb/>
all agreed to that- Love to<lb/>
Mrs Truby-</p>

If you do not remember my reviews of Gorgas's life I<lb/>
think I can dig you<lb/>
