<salute>Dear Doctor Maxcy:</salute>
</opener>
<p>This is just a note in more or less answer to your letter.</p>
<p>1&sol; I don't recollect the work you alluded to by Stott on re-<lb/>
lapses in malaria. In the early part of 1916, I read one--I think<lb/>
two--articles by Stott and someone else, in a British or Indian medi-<lb/>
cal journal, giving some rather elaborate observations on the use of<lb/>
quinine to immunize against malaria (the so-called &ldquo;quinine prophylaxis<lb/>
by the Italian method<unclear>&rdquo;</unclear>). <add>He used alternate units as controls</add> The result was decidedly against its value<lb/>
and the <hi rend="underline">implied</hi> deduction was that almost the only--or only--value it<lb/>
had was not to the men taking it--i. e. that it did not immunize them,<lb/>
but by preventing parasites in their cutaneous circulation anopheles<lb/>
cannot be infected from them and thus it protects the others who did not<lb/>
take it: insshort acting as long as it was taken like Koch's method--<lb/>
(the sterilization of carriers).</p>
<p>This theory is in direct contradiction to the fining of many<lb/>
carriers among those taking quinine this way: by Malcolm Watson in the<lb/>
Malay States: Ozard and others in Venezuela and in short I think of all<lb/>
who have examined them.</p>
<p>In this connection, when I was writing my little brocheur on im-<lb/>
munization from malaria by quinine, I had some correspondance with<lb/>
Celli and, at my instance, he agreed to have a blood index taken of a<lb/>
large number who had received his treatment and, if possible, compare<lb/>
it with the men under the same conditions who had not. I thought there<lb/>
was no place so good as Italy for investigating the effect of this immu-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0302057"/>
immu- 2<lb/>
nizing treatment on the existence of carriers (with parasites in the cu-<lb/>
taneous circulation infective to Anopheles) as Italy. Unfortunately<lb/>
he died not long afterwards and I have seen no report of any such<lb/>
work.</p>
<p>Mayne (who was &ldquo;Mitzmain&rdquo; then) told me that he knew Stott per-<lb/>
sonally and by reputation and that he was not regarded as very reliable.</p>
<p>Sell<del>er</del><add>a</add> is a very much smaller man than Celli and has recently<lb/>
done some work at Fiumicine in Italy and at ---- in Spain. His obser-<lb/>
vations on relapse are, I think, of small value.</p>
<p>Komp advised me recently that some observations have been made<lb/>
tending to show that punctipennis habitually gets its blood supply<lb/>
from other than human sources. LePrince: Griffitts and myself had the<lb/>
same idea in 1914-15, led thereto by finding them so much more fre-<lb/>
quently in stables: chicken houses: pig pens etc. than in residences.<lb/>
We found, however, so much <add>&ldquo;</add>porch biting<add>&rdquo;</add> of men by punctipennis in &sol;15<lb/>
and &sol;16 that we carried it no further. Field observations (at Chester<lb/>
S. C.: Bridgewater, N. C. and some places in Virginia) show that puncti-<lb/>
pennis--Headlee to the contrary:--do produce epidemics of malaria,<lb/>
though I still think are less efficient than A. quad. or A. crucians.<lb/>
The data Komp gives (the determination of the source of the blood found<lb/>
in the insects) offers, however, a good index as to the proportion of<lb/>
human and other blood they actually have taken.</p>
<p>With kindest regards, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>
