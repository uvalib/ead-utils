The Honorable Dean Acheson<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Mr. Secretary:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I wish to express to you the very sincere appreciation of myself and other<lb/>
Americans for the important services which one of your departmental<lb/>
associates, Mr. Willard Beaulac, United States Ambassador to Cuba, rendered<lb/>
last month when the Cuban Government dedicated &ldquo;Camp Lazear Memorial Park&rdquo;<lb/>
(named for the American physician-martyr, Dr. Jesse Lazear) near Havana.</p>
<p>Ambassador Beaulac's extremely helpful support on that occasion was of<lb/>
much greater importance than one not familiar with the historical sig-<lb/>
nificance of Camp Lazear or of the past and recent Cuban attitude toward<lb/>
Major Walter Reed and his associates would realize.</p>
<p>The participation in the Cuban ceremonies by Ambassador and Mrs. Beaulac<lb/>
and by four of his Embassy Staff (Mr. Earl Crain - First Secretary;<lb/>
Colonel Robert J. Mason - Air Attache; Lt. Colonel Vincent Elmore - Army<lb/>
Attache; Major Harold Lampner - U. S. Army Medical Corps) constituted an<lb/>
important diplomatic act as far as the Cuban people were concerned, and<lb/>
represented also a real service to the Medical Corps of the United States<lb/>
Army and to the American medical profession, in other words, to two large<lb/>
and important American organizations.</p>
<p>The friendly dignity exhibited by Ambassador Beaulac and his colleagues on<lb/>
this occasion which was one of special significance to the Cuban Government,<lb/>
medical profession and people (especially to certain sensitive elements<lb/>
thereof), was deeply appreciated by the Cubans and was responsible for a<lb/>
number of very sympathetic articles in the Cuban press which noted the<lb/>
supreme importance of the Cuban-American scientific cooperation responsible<lb/>
for the eradication of yellow fever, and the continuing good will existing<lb/>
between our two countries.</p>
<p>On this occasion for the first time, the Cuban Government, spending Cuban<lb/>
money, publicly honored the &ldquo;American&rdquo; conquerors of yellow fever (Major<lb/>
Walter Reed, Drs. James Carroll, Jesse Lazear, Aristides Agramonte and<lb/>
their soldier-volunteers), joining their names (in bronze memorials) with<lb/>
that of their illustrious Dr. Carlos Finlay, &ldquo;the symbol of Cuban science.&rdquo;<lb/>
The official support of the American diplomatic representatives in Cuba<lb/>

The Honorable Dean Acheson<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>
January 12, 1953<lb/>
was vital for the success of the affair. I and the many other Americans<lb/>
concerned are indeed grateful for the sympathetic interest and able co-<lb/>
operation which your department, in the person of Ambassador Beaulac and<lb/>
his staff, rendered on that occasion.</p>
