<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Referring to your letter of May 8th., enclosing copy of Hanson's<lb/>
of April 4th, which, more or less, brings the nature of the fever<lb/>
about Bucaramanga in question:</p>
<p>Naturally, I accepted the diagnosis of the White Board, which<lb/>
saw it and pronounced it yellow fever.</p>
<p>Yet for the difficulty that <hi>may</hi> occur in the differentiation<lb/>
between yellow fever and relapsing fever. I would invite your at-<lb/>
tention to Pp. 53 and 54 of my MSS (which you have) and also to a<lb/>
report from West Africa (French?) you sent me last summer, <add>of an unnamed spirochetosis</add>, which,<lb/>
<hi>from that report at least</hi>, could not have been differentiated from<lb/>
yellow fever and which, spite of the denial of the reporter, I am<lb/>
inclined to think was the spirochetosis of Obermeier.</p>
<p>Hanson reported last fall finding spirochetes of Obermeier in<lb/>
cases reported to him as yellow fever. This naturally threw some<lb/>
doubt on the nature of the previous fever and I wondered if White's<lb/>
party had an opportunity to examine patients in different stages<lb/>
of their sickness or whether they had to depend on the reports of<lb/>
others. If the latter, anyone might err in diagnosis; as witness<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01201010"/>
witness<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
the West African cases alluded to above. This too, might happen<lb/>
to myself unquestionably, if I saw a patient in only one stage (or<lb/>
maybe stages) of his illness and had not opportunity to follow him<lb/>
through it.</p>
<p>After seeing Hanson's report last fall, I sent him a brief<lb/>
abstract of the papers referred to in my MS and expressed my opinion<lb/>
that the &ldquo;<hi>Matlazuhuatl</hi>&rdquo; of the Mexican plateau and the similar epi-<lb/>
demics on that of the Andes (which gave rise to reports of yellow<lb/>
fever at Quito and Cerro de Pasco) were of the same nature and cau-<lb/>
tioned him against placing too much confidence in black vomit and<lb/>
bleeding gums in a cold climate as unfailing signs of yellow fever.</p>
<p>Naturally, if tick-borne the same disease could occur in hot<lb/>
countries.</p>
<p>Independently of the clinical determination, however, would<lb/>
not the positive determinations obtained by Porthier with cultures<lb/>
of Leptospira icteroides at Bucaramanga be sufficient basis for ac-<lb/>
cepting the diagnosis of yellow fever? I thought so after I had<lb/>
received a copy of his report--in December, I think, or later.<lb/>
Would it be reasonable that such reactions would be given by any<lb/>
other infection, even if the parasite causing it were of the same<lb/>
general family, as would be, I suppose, the spirochete of Obermeier?<lb/>
Also, would it not have been impossible for Porthier to have missed<lb/>
the spirochetes of Obermeier? They have been much in evidence in<lb/>
the few cases I have seen, both from their number and motion.</p>
<p>Leaving the nature of the fever of last summer <hi>sub judice</hi> <del>I<lb/>
cannot but think there was yellow fever. But for the seriological</del><lb/>
I am exceedingly glad that there seems to be no y.f. visible now.<lb/>
I cannot but think that there <hi>was</hi> y. f., although but for the seriological<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01201011"/>
seriological<lb/>
-3-<lb/>
reactions, of the value of which you are a better judge than I, I<lb/>
would doubt it. Both diseases might have coexisted.</p>
<p><del>I am exceedingly glad that there seems to be no yellow fever<lb/>
visible now.</del></p>
