<salute>Dear General Kean,</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of November 22 has been read with<lb/>
much interest. To date we have made no decision as to where<lb/>
to permanently place the painting, &ldquo;Conquerors of Yellow<lb/>
Fever&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have talked over your proposal with Mr.<lb/>
Withington of John Wyeth and Brother and we think both your<lb/>
suggestions are excellent.</p>
<p>Of course, we will not be ready to place the<lb/>
painting anywhere for permanent exhibition until such time as<lb/>
it is no longer requested for temporary exhibition in various<lb/>
parts of the country. All three paintings in the series are<lb/>
at present travelling around the country for exhibitions in<lb/>
medical schools, hospitals, and at medical society meetings.<lb/>
We transport them and take care of them without charge for<lb/>
the legitimate medical organizations who wish to exhibit them<lb/>
and we expect to do this as long as there is a demand.</p>
<p>Another feature which influences our decision<lb/>
is that some day it is possible that we may wish all eight or<lb/>
ten paintings in the series in one place. If we knew how<lb/>
soon the entire series would be completed and the new Army<lb/>
Medical Library were interested they might arrange to provide<lb/>
space for the entire series as a permanent loan. I would<lb/>
question the advisability of John Wyeth and Brother ever giv-<lb/>
ing them to any institution for the reason that even fifty<lb/>
years from now it is quite possible that Wyeth will still wish<lb/>
to reproduce these paintings and give them to another generation<lb/>
of young physicians. Consequently, it would be rather absurd<lb/>
for Wyeth to ask permission from some institution to reproduce<lb/>
paintings originally sponsored by themselves. A change in per-<lb/>
sonnel in any such institution might bring about a situation in<lb/>
which that provision would be denied. However, if we were to<lb/>
make a permanent loan<add>,</add> th<del><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del><add>e</add>n Wyeth would still own the paintings<lb/>
with the privilege of reproduction of them.</p>
<p>I think that this whole project is of consider-<lb/>
able importance and at this time while the plans for the new<lb/>
Medical Library are being formulated it will be an excellent<lb/>
idea for me to come to Washington and talk the matter over with<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fKACA0060"/>
-2-<lb/>
you as well as the Surgeon General of the Army. I think that<lb/>
General Ireland would probably be the person to get me in<del>to</del><lb/>
contact with the present Surgeon General.</p>
<p>This whole project is one of those long term affairs<lb/>
deserving of considerable planning in advance and I shall make<lb/>
it a point to come down and see you as soon as I can get away<lb/>
from this office for a couple of days.</p>
<p>Your interest is very much appreciated.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
