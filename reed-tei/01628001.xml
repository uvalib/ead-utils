<salute>My Own darling Emilie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>On this beauti-<lb/>
ful, bright Sabbath morning, I gladly yield<lb/>
to the impulse which bids me write a<lb/>
short letter to you. There is no sermon<lb/>
to be preached in this Church-land, this<lb/>
morning; my brother has gone to his ap-<lb/>
pointment some 10 miles away; sister<lb/>
has concluded to beckon the God of<lb/>
Sleep, and I, left all alone, can find no<lb/>
more delightful employment than com-<lb/>
muning, for a while, with my sweet Em-<lb/>
ilie, who, though across the borders of<lb/>
another state, has been as much present<lb/>
in my mind, all this bright morning, as if<lb/>
she had been by my side! Yes! I have<lb/>
been sitting in an old, comfortable<lb/>
rocking-chair, (one of those honestly-con-<lb/>
structed chairs that our fathers and<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01628002"/>
mothers loved to sit in, when the day's<lb/>
work was done,) <add>and</add> with my head thrown<lb/>
back and my hat drawn over my face<lb/>
so as to exclude the Sun's brightness, I<lb/>
have been with you in imagination.<lb/>
In fancy, I saw you mending your way to<lb/>
the House of Worship, with a sweet smile<lb/>
on your happy face- Seated in your ac-<lb/>
customed pew, I saw your head bowed<lb/>
in the attitude of silent prayer, and<lb/>
when that prayer had ceased, I beheld<lb/>
that calm look of devotion which should<lb/>
ever characterize the Christian woman in<lb/>
the pres<del>c</del>ence of her <del>m</del>Maker. I heard your<lb/>
voice blending sweetly in the song of<lb/>
praise that rolled up to the Great<lb/>
White Throne; I looked in your eye,<lb/>
steadily fixed on the Speaker, as he<lb/>
told of the trials of the Christian in this<lb/>
world &amp; of the joys that await him in<lb/>
the world to come; I watch<add>ed</add> you, as you<lb/>
left the Sanctuary, nor did my eye leave<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01628003"/>
your form till it disappeared across the<lb/>
threshold of your home; and then as the<lb/>
thought occurred to me, &ldquo;that darling<lb/>
girl loves me, and, in confidence, has<lb/>
given herself to me, and perchance,<lb/>
during this very morning, has thought<lb/>
of me,&rdquo; I could but exclaim, &ldquo;Oh Fath-<lb/>
er in Heaven! what good have I done<lb/>
to merit this pre<del>s</del>cious love &amp; this in-<lb/>
estimable gift&rdquo;! nor would I repress<lb/>
the prayer which sprung up sponta-<lb/>
neously in my heart, &ldquo;Oh! Father! what<lb/>
is weak in me, Strengthen; what is im-<lb/>
pure, purify; prepare me in heart<lb/>
and mind for the battles of life, and in<lb/>
all things make me worthy of my<lb/>
darling Emilie's unbounded love&rdquo;!<lb/>
I made no effort to check my flowing tears,<lb/>
for as they coursed down my cheek,<lb/>
I felt that my prayer had been accepted<lb/>
in Heaven, &amp; that Strength would be given<lb/>
me &ldquo;in every time of need-&rdquo; Ah! if I<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01628004"/>
could tell you, this morning, of my <hi>love</hi>! I<lb/>
can't transcribe it on paper, but could<lb/>
you look into my heart, you would behold<lb/>
a fountain, pure &amp; inexhaustible, suffi-<lb/>
cient for Time and Eternity! I know<lb/>
that you are worthy of all <add>of</add> my devotion,<lb/>
and I am determined that all of it shall<lb/>
be bestowed upon you, and to daily<lb/>
pray that the capacity of loving you,<lb/>
<hi>more</hi> &amp; <hi>more</hi>, may be granted unto me,<lb/>
one look into my heart would arm<lb/>
you against all the false alarms<lb/>
which &ldquo;older heads&rdquo; can trump up, &amp;<lb/>
convince you, beyond the shadow of<lb/>
a doubt, that nothing but Heaven's<lb/>
Will(to which I always humbly bow) can<lb/>
long keep us separated! You would<lb/>
not exclaim, &ldquo;Oh! Separation! that checks<lb/>
the laughter of young hearts;&rdquo; but rath-<lb/>
er, &ldquo;Oh! Time! how rapid is thy flight&rdquo;.<lb/>
Do not forget that you must <hi>soon</hi> be<lb/>
mine &amp; mine <hi>forever</hi>! Till that glad<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01628005"/>
time shall arrive, your sweet self shall<lb/>
be present with me every moment of<lb/>
my existence.</p>
<p>Do you know that it would be a source<lb/>
of much happiness to know that at<lb/>
some hour of each day you were<lb/>
thinking of me? A few evenings ago,<lb/>
while gazing at the Heavens, my eyes<lb/>
fell upon the planet Jupiter, a<lb/>
beautiful &amp; brilliant star, which<lb/>
every night may be seen in the<lb/>
Southern part of the Heavens, accom-<lb/>
panied by a smaller star just be-<lb/>
neath it. While admiring its brilliancy,<lb/>
I thought to myself, what a sweet<lb/>
satisfaction it would be to know<lb/>
that each night, at some particular hour,<lb/>
my darling Emilie was watching, from<lb/>
her window, this far off world &amp;<lb/>
thinking of <hi>me</hi>! Let us, each night,<lb/>
my darling, watch this Gem of the<lb/>
Sky, &amp; while our eyes are turned to-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01628006"/>
ward <del>the</del> Heaven, let our thoughts be<lb/>
turned to each other! Don't forget, in<lb/>
your next letter, to tell me whether this<lb/>
meets your approbation-</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, I went to Norfolk,<lb/>
and, of course, called on your sister<lb/>
Annie. Had a short &amp; pleasant con-<lb/>
versation, arranging our future visit<lb/>
to Harrisonburg- I anticipate a very<lb/>
happy trip up the country in company<lb/>
with Mrs. Vaughan- and a pleasant<lb/>
time after <del>my</del><add>our</add> arrival- I am expecting<lb/>
to go to Baltimore soon after I reach<lb/>
home &amp; spend a few days with Dr<lb/>
Torney- If I conclude to go, I will write<lb/>
you, advising you of the fact, soon<lb/>
after I get home- Shall, probably,<lb/>
go to Norfolk, tomorrow, &amp; will expect<lb/>
to find a sweet letter from <add>you,</add> at the<lb/>
Portsmouth P.O-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, sweetheart,<lb/>
Devotedly, yours,</salute>
<signed>Walter.</signed>
