<salute>Dear Doctor Kelly:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have<lb/>
noticed one or two additional<lb/>
errors of fact and date<lb/>
in your little book and<lb/>
I readily call your attention<lb/>
to them as you requested<lb/>
because I know that with<lb/>
you the truth will prevail<lb/>
above all other considerations.</p>
<p>I desire particularly to<lb/>
call your attention to the<lb/>
remark in the par. at the<lb/>
foot of p. 133, that the ex-<lb/>
periment on me &ldquo;was followed by<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02835002"/>
2.<lb/>
eleven others, of which nine<lb/>
were negative and two<lb/>
positive.&rdquo; That would make<lb/>
three positive cases, while<lb/>
as a matter of fact there<lb/>
were only two, myself and<lb/>
the soldier x - y, and <add>we</add> were<lb/>
the two last of these experi-<lb/>
ments, the <hi>first nine</hi> being<lb/>
negative, for the reason<lb/>
that in those cases, all<lb/>
the mosquitoes, with a<lb/>
single exception, had been<lb/>
kept a shorter period than<lb/>
12 days after biting a patient.<lb/>
The exception was a single<lb/>
insect that had bitten a<lb/>
very mild case in the <hi>5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi><lb/>
day of the disease, 13 days earlier.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f02835003"/>
<p>3.</p>
<p>The same mosquito that was applied to me<lb/>
12 days after its contamination was also one of<lb/>
those applied four days later to Case No 11<lb/>
and he also was infected and came down<lb/>
with yellow fever. This proved confirmatory<lb/>
of the source of my infection so that in cases<lb/>
10 and 11 we have a <hi>demonstration</hi> of the<lb/>
mosquito theory and <hi>confirmation</hi> of it,<lb/>
all the work of Lazear, during Reed's absence<lb/>
in the United States. For proof of these assertions<lb/>
see pp 10 and 19 of the Preliminary Note, which was<lb/>
written by Reed and presented by him to the<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02835004"/>
4.<lb/>
Am. Pub. Health Ass'n at Indianapolis, <hi>Oct. 27, 1900.</hi><lb/>
Is there anything doubtful in the working of<lb/>
the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Conclusion at the end of the paper?<lb/>
The discovery was made by Lazear in my own<lb/>
person and it was confirmed immediately<lb/>
in a second case. Is it fair, is it just then<lb/>
to single out Reed and give to him the sole<lb/>
credit of a discovery that was made while he<lb/>
was more than a thousand miles away? On the<lb/>
evening of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of August, Reed, Lazear and<lb/>
I agreed to be bitten. On the following<lb/>
morning Reed sailed for the United States,<lb/>
without a word of explanation so far as I knew<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02835005"/>
5.<lb/>
He was given <hi>carte blanche</hi> by Gen Sternberg<lb/>
to go and come as he pleased. He returned<lb/>
in October to verify and write up the<lb/>
results reported to him by mail. When<lb/>
he wrote the letter you cite on p. 141 of<lb/>
your book, his recollection of the facts<lb/>
was evidently less clear than with<lb/>
those who had been through the <hi>fun.</hi><lb/>
I hope you will not think unkindly<lb/>
of me for mentioning these facts for I have<lb/>
a wife and family of seven children in<lb/>
whose interest it is my duty to speak the truth.<lb/>

Notwithstanding promises since 1900, the<lb/>
only recognition accorded to me was the<lb/>
waving of the age limit to permit me as a<lb/>
Contract (Act'g Asst.) Surgeon, to take the ex-<lb/>
amination for the regular service, after I had<lb/>
served continuously twenty-eight and a half<lb/>
years with a clear record, 24+ years in the<lb/>
regular army. This reminds me of an error<lb/>
on p. 255. I have been in the Army since <hi>January<lb/>
1874</hi> continuously.</p>
<p>Let us have the truth. The efforts of<lb/>
a few individuals to give the sole credit<lb/>
to Reed is wrong in principle and in fact.<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02835007"/>

The credit belongs to the Board. If it were to<lb/>
be given to a single individual it should<lb/>
go to Lazear. I enclose a copy of the<lb/>
Preliminary Report referred to.</p>
<p>Believe me, with sincere regards,</p>
<closer>

<salute>Yours very truly,</salute>
