<salute>Dear General:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I deeply appreciate the information you sent me with your letter of<lb/>
18th inst.- Believe me General, I heartily thank for your kindness, which I will<lb/>
never forget, for in your report I have found everything I needed for my records.</p>
<p>General, in your letter you inform me that the inoculations practiced by Lazear<lb/>
on American Volunteer soldiers in August 1900, were eleven in number and I would<lb/>
like to know possible, the names of said soldiers for I can assure you that in eve-<lb/>
ry report on research related to this matter I have read, - this is my belief- I<lb/>
think they are not correct in many of their statement. However, if I could attain<lb/>
the names of these eleven soldiers, they would be very useful to me in order to<lb/>
clear definitely this matter. You also state in your letter that Dr Echevarria,<lb/>
(whom I believe you refer to as Dr Rafel Echevarria, deceased) had in his charge<lb/>
a camp at Quemados, to Camp there Americans that were not inmune, which when taken <unclear>t</unclear><lb/>
there, the epidemic had disappeared. I am very interested in knowing if you could<lb/>
point out the place where said camp was situated, during what period of time it<lb/>
functioned, and what personnel was in charge of it, and how many persons were ta-<lb/>
ken there during the time <unclear>it</unclear> functioned.</p>
<p>I also wish to state that the name &ldquo;Truby and Ames Camp&rdquo; for Yellow Fever &ldquo;Cases&rdquo;<lb/>
is of my own nomination which I use to differ the place where the wards were located<lb/>
for the attention of Yellow Fever Cases.</p>
<p>Pardon me, dear General, for all the trouble I am causing you wish these lines<lb/>
but I am taking the liberty of your kindness in behalf of the importance and inte-<lb/>
rest that all these facts are subject to.</p>
<p>I would appreciate that on the publication of your reports of these investiga-<lb/>
tions and experiences, have the honor and pleasure of reading them, due to great<lb/>
knowledge which I am sure I shall obtain from them. Therefore I beg you to let me<lb/>
know what ever cost this will imply, in order to forward it inmediately.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your kindness, and with my best wishes and many greetings of<lb/>
the season; I remain:</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours;</salute>
