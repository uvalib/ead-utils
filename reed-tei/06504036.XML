<p>Truby is extremely critical of Standlee's manuscript, and believes that she is not competent to write an accurate account. He encloses a copy of his letter to her.</p>

<salute>Dear Dr Hench.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Mrs T, Elizabeth &amp; I all enjoyed<lb/>
your fine, newsy letter of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. I don't<lb/>
blame you a bit for being proud of those<lb/>
talented &ldquo;Kids&rdquo;. Even I like to boast about<lb/>
mine. You have met one of them and I do<lb/>
hope you will meet my other two - Barbara and<lb/>
Jack. The latter was 6 ft 1 in when he left home<lb/>
at 17 to enter West Point. He is now a Capt. of<lb/>
Infantry, stationed at 71 Bragg. N.C., commands<lb/>
a Company of Infantry paratroopers, and of<lb/>
course is one himself. At West Point he<lb/>
made the swimming team in his plebe year and<lb/>
was on that until he graduated. During his<lb/>
last year his team won the intercollegiate<lb/>
swimming championship defeating Yale, who<lb/>
still had that great champion from the Canal<lb/>
Zone (can't think of his name) That was the first<lb/>
time West Point ever won in swimming. So<lb/>
&ldquo;little me&rdquo; is proud as a Pop-too. Oh! about<lb/>
Barbara. She was the red haired beauty of<lb/>
the family, a fine horsewoman and often rode<lb/>
in Col Patton's (The famous hero of World War II)<lb/>
horse shows at Ft Myer Va. She married<lb/>
Col LaGarde's son, and lives in Maryland.<lb/>
There that is all on that subject.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reprints (yf episode) I appreciate<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06504037"/>
AC<lb/>
Tr<lb/>
them very much and they will land in<lb/>
good hands where they will be much appreciated<lb/>
Will enclose <add>copy of</add> my <xref id="t06504038">reply</xref>
to Mrs. Standle's request<lb/>
for haste on Chapter III of her story. I could<lb/>
not take it, and am so happy that I exploded<lb/>
for it was not possible for me to wade<lb/>
through the voluminous mms. and comment on<lb/>
things that I know more about them she ever<lb/>
will. As you will see, nearly all <add>of the answers to</add> <del>of</del> her errors<lb/>
in the yf. episode could easily be found<lb/>
in my book. She either had not read the<lb/>
book <del>or some one</del> or some one had made<lb/>
her think it was not a trustworthy source<lb/>
of information on the subject. When she quoted<lb/>
Hemmeter on what Dr Welch had said about<lb/>
Carroll and omited to quote the nice things<lb/>
Welch &amp; other great men said about Reed<lb/>
in the Senate Document, I knew it was<lb/>
time for me to withdraw all connection<lb/>
with her story. I was really nervous<lb/>
and completely upset but as you see I<lb/>
am back again on an even Keel. I hope<lb/>
she will see the light and not try to<lb/>
solve the controversies of yf., but leave it<lb/>
to you as I suggested. To write a history<lb/>
about a discredited hero with such grand<lb/>
memorial as the W.R Q.H would be a force.</p>
<p>I have been swamped with work but begin<lb/>
to see the light. I have done this in haste<lb/>
for I know I have neglected you very much<lb/>
lately. We all send our greetings and know<lb/>
you will enjoy all the grand doings with your<lb/>
&ldquo;kids&rdquo; in June.</p>
