<salute>My dear Hutch:</salute>
</opener>
<p>In a very few days, I will send you my memorandum on my trip to Havana,<lb/>
and the status of my yellow fever historical researches so far. I will then ask<lb/>
you to write letters to three or four people who will, I am sure, help me more<lb/>
if they know that you, representing the college, appreciate their efforts.</p>
<p>In the meantime, can you give me the official dope on Lazear's connection<lb/>
with W. and J.? I have not seen W. and J. mentioned in any of his previous bio-<lb/>
graphies. One biography said he had gone to &ldquo;Trinity Hall&ldquo;, a private school<lb/>
in Washington, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Johns Hopkins in 1889, presumably<lb/>
from the academic department, and from Columbia Medical School in 1892. Is<lb/>
&ldquo;Trinity Hall&rdquo; a part of W. and J. or has it since been incorporated into W.<lb/>
and J.?</p>
<p>Will you also send me the exact date of the October meeting? I am<lb/>
finding out how much a round trip from Havana to Washington, Pennsylvania<lb/>
would be and will see to it that you receive a check from me for that amount;<lb/>
but Mr. Moran thought it was possible that Mr. Pew or the company would pay<lb/>
his way, and I said nothing about my willingness to pay, thinking that you could<lb/>
use my check for some other purpose perhaps. I personally want to make this<lb/>
contribution, and if he doesn't get the money from Pew, I think it is better<lb/>
for the money to apparently come from the college rather than from me personally.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Always yours,</salute>

P.S. Our local office tells me that the railroad fare, first-class, between<lb/>
Pittsburgh and Havana by way of Miami--Havana to Miami by boat and Miami to Pittsburgh<lb/>
by train, is $129.15, perhaps a little bit less than the winter excursion rate. The<lb/>
first class rate by boat from Miami to New York is $75.00 to $90.00 round trip, $25.25<lb/>
railroad fare round trip between New York and Pittsburgh with Pullman charge of $3.15<lb/>
each way or a maximum of $131.55, making it approximately the same whether he comes by<lb/>
rail or by boat. I enclose a check for $150.00 to cover these expenses. If you can get<lb/>
the money from Pew, you can use it for some other, perhaps even more worthy, purpose<lb/>
for W. and J.<lb/>
