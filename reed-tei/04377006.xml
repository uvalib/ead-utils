<salute>Dear Phil:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I'm sorry not to have written long ago in answer<lb/>
to your nice letter and about the telegram and some of<lb/>
the points you wanted to know regarding our data on<lb/>
Walter Reed. The unfortunate fact is that I misplaced<lb/>
your letter and could not remember the particular points<lb/>
you inquired about; and I have been hoping ever since<lb/>
that your letter would turn up. However, the letter hasn'<lb/>
come to light and I can't wait any longer without letting<lb/>
you know how very much we appreciated the telegram you sent<lb/>
us. It really is a gem and I used it as the highlight of<lb/>
our ceremonies commemorating Walter Reed's birthday. I also<lb/>
quoted it in my opening address to the Freshman students a<lb/>
week or so later for I could find no other words quite so<lb/>
good to use in pointing out to the new students the aims<lb/>
of medicine. Now your telegram is a part of our material<lb/>
on Walter Reed in the college library.</p>
<p>The ceremony for Reed went off quite well, I think.<lb/>
Frank Netter, one of our graduates of a few years ago, was<lb/>
present as the painter of the portrait of Walter Reed which<lb/>
the alumni presented to the school. Netter is really a<lb/>
competent artist and we are glad indeed to have his painting.<lb/>
General Reed and Mrs. Blossom Reed were not able to come<lb/>
but we had a goodly representation of others interested in<lb/>
military medicine and tropical medicine and the like, and I<lb/>
believe our party was well worth having, In fact, I believe<lb/>
it would have been well worth while if only to provide an<lb/>
occasion to read your telegram!</p>
<p>I am sorry I haven't got your questions before me so<lb/>
that I can answer them. Perhaps you will be good enough to<lb/>
send them to me again, if you still have them in mind.</p>
<p>My thanks to you and best greetings to you and Mary.</p>
