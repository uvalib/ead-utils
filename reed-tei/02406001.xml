</opener>
<p>If you<lb/>
ever write me <hi>another</hi> let-<lb/>
ter like the one you wrote<lb/>
on January 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>, I really don't<lb/>
know what I will do with<lb/>
you! How could you begin<lb/>
your letter, &ldquo;it is with hu-<lb/>
miliation &amp; sorrow that I<lb/>
enclose B's &amp; my expenses&rdquo;!<lb/>
Did a body ever hear of<lb/>
such a thing? what was<lb/>
the matter with your<lb/>
darling expenses? <hi>I</hi> did-<lb/>
n't see anything <hi>wrong</hi><lb/>
in them! I had supposed<lb/>
that with Johnnie Moore's<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02406002"/>
bills, your December expenses<lb/>
would be not less than<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>330.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi>, and am very glad to<lb/>
find that they have only<lb/>
been <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>290.<hi>28</hi>. I think that<lb/>
considering the Christmas<lb/>
Holidays, you have managed<lb/>
<hi>splendidly</hi>, my precious heart!<lb/>
But suppose your expenses<lb/>
had been <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>390.28, would<lb/>
that have been any reason<lb/>
for getting blue and being<lb/>
distressed? For Heaven's<lb/>
sake, dear Miss Gouty, don't<lb/>
write that way any more,<lb/>
or I shall get dreadfully<lb/>
provoked- After putting<lb/>
<hi rend="superscript">$</hi>953.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> in improvements<lb/>
on our darling home,<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02406003"/>
we have saved- <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>700.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> during<lb/>
the year- Instead of being<lb/>
gloomy over that, I think<lb/>
we should be well satis-<lb/>
fied- We can't save <hi>all</hi><lb/>
of our income, sweetheart!<lb/>
Why, bless your darling heart<lb/>
you know that I am not<lb/>
the kind of man to deny<del>y</del> my<lb/>
sweet girls a few articles<lb/>
of clothing, when these things<lb/>
are necessary- Why didn't<lb/>
you get more flowers for<lb/>
your room and some present<lb/>
for yourself- Do pray go to<lb/>
the theatre <hi>just when you<lb/>
want to and take fat Miss<lb/>
Annapolis with you</hi>!<lb/>
You will find that January's<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02406004"/>
expenses will be less, and then<lb/>
I hope that you will <hi>brace</hi><lb/>
up a little bit. It wasn't<lb/>
necessary that my darling<lb/>
wifie should write out<lb/>
in detail all that you<lb/>
spent- You must have had<lb/>
a dreadful headache after<lb/>
doing that- I am so sorry<lb/>
that your new year's was<lb/>
such a lonely day- I think<lb/>
my sweetheart, that you bor-<lb/>
row too much trouble when<lb/>
there is no reason for it-<lb/>
I had thought that when<lb/>
<hi>I was away</hi>, you remained<lb/>
<hi>always so cheerful</hi>! He! he!<lb/>
Brace up Miss Gouty!<lb/>
Never mind about your<lb/>
husband being famous-<lb/>
Just drop that and attend<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02406005"/>
to your own darling self-<lb/>
I hope that my letter, written<lb/>
on the last night of the old<lb/>
Century, cheered you up a<lb/>
wee <del>t</del> bit- You dont know how<lb/>
proud I am of my sweet wifie<lb/>
and daughter, and I am proud<lb/>
of that boy, too! And so is his<lb/>
mother- <hi>Tuesday night</hi> - <hi>8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>-<lb/>
I couldn't get any chance to<lb/>
write any to-day on my letter.<lb/>
Had to go to the Camp, this<lb/>
morning, and this afternoon,<lb/>
drove into Havana to make<lb/>
my party call on Gen. &amp; Mrs.<lb/>
Wood. Tuesday is her day<lb/>
from 3 to 5 P.M- Mrs. Wood<lb/>
really looked very pretty,<lb/>
and her manner is so un-<lb/>
affected that it does<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02406006"/>
one good to meet such a<lb/>
person and pass a few<lb/>
words- Dearest heart! I<lb/>
am so sorry that I cannot<lb/>
advise you to take that<lb/>
sea-voyage at this season<lb/>
of the year. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Connell<lb/>
has just arrived, to-day, by<lb/>
Transport, and he says that<lb/>
it was so cold in New<lb/>
York and that the trip down<lb/>
was dreadfully rough-<lb/>
I couldn't let my precious<lb/>
wifie come unless I could<lb/>
be with you, and then <hi>I</hi><lb/>
would be of no possible <add>use</add>.<lb/>
It makes me very un-<lb/>
happy to know that you<lb/>
want to come so badly<lb/>
and that I can't approve<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02406007"/>
of it- If you were already<lb/>
here, we could manage<lb/>
to get along, but it is the<lb/>
getting here that is so very<lb/>
troublesome- You can't im-<lb/>
agine how I have worried<lb/>
for the last few days, since<lb/>
I got your letter saying<lb/>
that your friends thought<lb/>
that a trip to Cuba was<lb/>
just what you needed.<lb/>
To know that you want to<lb/>
come &amp; that I cannot, at<lb/>
once, arrange for your<lb/>
coming, makes me just<lb/>
as unhappy as I can be.<lb/>
Please, when you get this, sweet-<lb/>
heart, write and decide <add>whether</add><del>once</del><lb/>
you will come, &amp; if so, you<lb/>
can leave New York about<lb/>
Feb. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>, &amp; we will remain<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02406008"/>
till the middle of April- I had<lb/>
expected to make <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>250.<hi rend="superscript">00</hi> of my<lb/>
Columbian Salary, but that isn't<lb/>
really necessary, as we can<lb/>
get along without it-<hi>I want<lb/>
to do just what you want to do</hi>!<lb/>
Goodnight, you sweet joys! Boo! Boo!<lb/>
<hi>Wednesday morning - 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>- Wake up! You<lb/>
sleepy girls and get ready for break-<lb/>
fast- Your old M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mantee is<lb/>
up and ready for his bath, and yet<lb/>
his girls are still <hi>snoring</hi> away!<lb/>
Only about 4 weeks more, and<lb/>
Papa can start back to see his<lb/>
precious babies, and won't he be<lb/>
glad to get back? He is now<lb/>
counting off the days &amp; if pre-<lb/>
cious <hi>mother doesn't pass him<lb/>
on the way</hi>, he will soon see both<lb/>
of his fat, sweet children, who<lb/>
have been so good &amp; sweet since<lb/>
he left- Take care of your precious<lb/>
selves, and you <hi>must wake</hi> up!!<lb/>
Love &amp; kisses &amp; kisses &amp; love for the<lb/>
sweetest girls in all the world-</p>
