<hi>Tuesday night</hi>
<salute>My precious wifie;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have just<lb/>
returned from Dr Stark's<lb/>
where the whole garrison<lb/>
has been to congratulate<lb/>
him on his promotion <del>at</del> to<lb/>
a majority in the volunteer<lb/>
service- We, of course, as<lb/>
is customary on such oc-<lb/>
casions, took a few glasses<lb/>
of champagne, in order to<lb/>
drink to his good health, and<lb/>
to that of his wife. <hi>We</hi> (that<lb/>
is your humble service) were<lb/>
careful to take <hi>very little</hi>,<lb/>
as we didn't want to wake<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f02208002"/>
up with a <hi>headache</hi> in the<lb/>
morning! I am beginning<lb/>
to think that Columbia Bar-<lb/>
racks promises to be very<lb/>
gay, this winter, with three<lb/>
events during the past two<lb/>
weeks- For myself, I don't<lb/>
propose to patronize any<lb/>
more of the social events,<lb/>
as I have something else to<lb/>
do- I am glad to say that<lb/>
my experimental station is<lb/>
almost finished- The houses<lb/>
are nearing completion, and<lb/>
before you get this, we will<lb/>
have begun our observations-<lb/>
Every body has been willing<lb/>
to assist me and all seem<lb/>
to take such an interest<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02208003"/>
in our work. The Camp<lb/>
selected is a very good one<lb/>
&amp; well located- I had not<lb/>
expected to get it in running<lb/>
order until Dec 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>, as there<lb/>
were so many things to do<lb/>
and to get straightened out.<lb/>
Dr Kean has <add>been</add> put in charge<lb/>
of all expenditures for the Camp,<lb/>
so that this part is entirely<lb/>
taken off my hands- I have<lb/>
never seen any one so<lb/>
much interested in any<lb/>
work as the Doctor is in<lb/>
this- He can't do enough<lb/>
to help me out, and is<lb/>
at my service at all<lb/>
times- I am so very glad<lb/>
that he did not go to the<lb/>
states, as he was first ordered to do.<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02208004"/>
<hi>Wednesday morning 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi></hi>- <hi>No headache</hi><lb/>
this morning, lovie, dear -- but I<lb/>
came very near oversleeping<lb/>
myself and thereby failing to get<lb/>
this letter in the mail- It isn't<lb/>
a very long or very interesting<lb/>
letter, but it is <hi>better</hi> than<lb/>
<hi>no letter</hi>; isn't it sweetheart?<lb/>
and that was <hi>my situation</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi><lb/>
last when no letter came from<lb/>
my darling girls- But <hi>three</hi> came<lb/>
on Saturday and I guess two or<lb/>
three, or perhaps <hi>four</hi> (Quien<lb/>
Sabe?) will come to-day, and then<lb/>
I shall be so happy- I know that<lb/>
you must be having good weather<lb/>
in the states, as it is so much<lb/>
warmer here- The cool weather<lb/>
from Nov. 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> to 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, has brought<lb/>
the fever down 50% in Havana.<lb/>
That kind of looks like the <hi>Mosquito</hi>.<lb/>
Be good children &amp; study your lessons<lb/>
very hard- Go to the theatre when you<lb/>
want to- Kisses &amp; love for my dear,<lb/>
dear girls- Boo! Boo!</p>
