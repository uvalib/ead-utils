<salute>Dear Laura:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I enclose a letter of Dr. Wymans rec'd<lb/>
yesterday. I answered it yesterday &amp; also wrote<lb/>
Glennan asking (1) if the detail were temporary<lb/>
or permanent. I am reasonably sure the latter: (2)<lb/>
when I w'd be expected to leave, telling him that<lb/>
I <hi rend="underline">had</hi> intended to get leave go on to Balt; <del>&amp; put</del><lb/>
put you in Thayer's care &amp; remain until you<lb/>
got well. Thayer however will not return un-<lb/>
til about October 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> so the Hos'l wrote me<lb/>
<unclear>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>hae</unclear> is in his place. He was House Physici-<lb/>
an after <unclear>Futcher</unclear> &amp; Asst. House when I was there<lb/>
<hi rend="underline">in</hi> 1900, &amp; is an able man.</p>
<p>I do not exactly know what is best to be done<lb/>
(1) Whether, supposing as seems probable, that <del>we all</del><lb/>
<del>go,</del> the detail is more or less permanent, we all<lb/>
you, your mother &amp; I, (Ned is a separate problem) go<lb/>
on<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0127029"/>
on &amp; take our chance of getting you well over there<lb/>
or (b) leave you here, say under Kinyoun's care, to<lb/>
go to Thayer when he returns. get well &amp; then<lb/>
follow us or (c) go now, I coming on, <unclear>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>hae</unclear> get his<lb/>
diagnosis &amp; advice <del>&amp; dec</del>a matter I suppose of 5 to<lb/>
<hi rend="underline">possibly 15</hi> days &amp; on that decide whether (a) or (b) is<lb/>
most advantageous. I can possibly tell better when I<lb/>
hear from Glennan. I want you to get <hi rend="underline">well</hi>, no inconveni-<lb/>
ence is too great: no annoyance too much to undertake<lb/>
to get <hi rend="underline">well</hi>.</p>
<p>It had pleased me best to have had this<lb/>
<del>aid</del>notice in March next. Then there had please<lb/>
God been no problem connected with either<lb/>
Ned or yourself. He told me yesterday that he<lb/>
thought he had passed the 600 word test you know<lb/>
<del>that</del>the test is not read in class now<lb/>
now<lb/>
but transcribed at<lb/>
once, so he cannot def-<lb/>
initely tell untill<lb/>
Mr. Mayor passes on the<lb/>
transcription. He asked<lb/>
me to call him up<lb/>
at recess <add>today</add> to ask. So I hope<lb/>
for the best. There is<lb/>
a <hi rend="italic">4</hi><hi rend="superscript">th</hi> letter to write<lb/>
he said &amp; he doesn't<lb/>
know whether he<lb/>
has the other three, or<lb/>
some of them, to write<lb/>
over as Mr. M. has not<lb/>
told him. This however<lb/>
is a minor thing<lb/>
compared with the<lb/>
<lb/>
United States Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service,<lb/>
OFFICE OF MEDICAL OFFICER IN COMMAND,<lb/>
, 190<lb/>
Surgeon.<lb/>
SUBJECT:<lb/>
NO. OF INCLOSURES,<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="fC0127030"/>
Medical Off 600 word test. Also he says<lb/>
Mr. M. lost his &ldquo;big Billing sheet&rdquo; &amp;<lb/>
unless it can be found he will have<lb/>
to do it over. This is not improbable, as simi-<lb/>
lar things happened. He ought to go to a<lb/>
Sanitarium for a month after he leaves<lb/>
College before he goes to work <del>as</del>&amp; I will<lb/>
try to arrange it for him.</p>
<p>I am going to Dr. White (for an extra pair<lb/>
of glasses) today.</p>
<p>I wish this thing had come 6 months later,<lb/>
or not at all. The last I sh'd not say as<lb/>
it gives me another chance to do a man's<lb/>
work &amp; I will, please God, rise to the ne-<lb/>
cessity when it arrives.</p>
<p>I do not think, &ldquo;living expenses&rdquo;<del>means</del><lb/>
includes those of my family, i.e., I would<lb/>
get just what I get on <hi rend="underline">any</hi> special detail.<lb/>
Whether the service give me my foreign<lb/>
commulation $90. per month I do not<lb/>
know<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="fC0127031"/>
know. If not I will get less than I w'd on<lb/>
a regular foreign detail. However it is a ques-<lb/>
tion of service not of pay.</p>
