<salute>Dear Dr. Hench,</salute>
</opener>
<p>(If you are shocked by the familiarity of<lb/>
my address, bear in mind that you have brought it on your<lb/>
own self.)</p>
<p>I have been planning to write to you ever<lb/>
since Atlantic City, particularly to congratulate you on the<lb/>
splendid set of slides which you have worked up for your<lb/>
lecture. When the war is over if you want to go on tour<lb/>
let me act as your business manager and booking agent and<lb/>
I think we can go to town.</p>
<p>Seriously, if you are to be located in<lb/>
Washington, I would like to arrange a lecture engagement<lb/>
for you in Philadelphia, probably with the Philadelphia<lb/>
Academy of Medicine. By making this arrangement you would<lb/>
not only have a large audience of physicians but we could<lb/>
arrange to have all of the Wyeth representatives who work<lb/>
near Philadelphia present. I could not ask you to come to<lb/>
Philadelphia just to lecture to our men but the combination<lb/>
would yield quite an audience.</p>
<p>I just had word from my brother, Dr. Howard<lb/>
B. Kellogg, in Seattle, that he is to get a Lieutenant<lb/>
Colonel's commission in the base hospital corps which has<lb/>
been organized in that city for some time. He will be in<lb/>
charge of surgery. They expect to be called up most any<lb/>
day. I presume that there are so many base hospital units<lb/>
that any one is quite obscure in the Surgeon General's office,<lb/>
but in the future, should your relations with such corps ever<lb/>
bring the name of Dr. Howard B. Kellogg to your attention, I<lb/>
would like to have you remember the connection.</p>
<p>I did not have an opportunity to tell you<lb/>
after the luncheon at the Traymore that I give you a large<lb/>
percentage of credit for our acquiring Col. Rankin as speaker<lb/>
for the occasion. I saw the Colonel Friday morning just<lb/>
before I left and he seemed to be in a good mood and felt<lb/>
that he had had a good party. I was much pleased with this<lb/>
as I felt that he might be somewhat resentful at having to<lb/>
take the time for this ceremony when he was so busy with<lb/>
other matters, but he didn't seem to feel that way at all.</p>

<p>Both Doris and I enjoyed the dinner very much<lb/>
and please give my kindest regards to Mrs. Hench.<lb/>
You may expect to see me in Washington before the<lb/>
end of the summer.</p>

Attached find a copy of a letter addressed<lb/>
to one of our detail supervisors from a representative<lb/>
in Omaha. Just how much of a part Dr. Pinto played in<lb/>
the Yellow Fever Investigation I don't know, but if you<lb/>
are not in touch with him you will welcome getting his<lb/>
address.<lb/>
