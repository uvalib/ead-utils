<p>GREAT FRENCHMAN ONCE LIVED<lb/>
IN WAVERLY.</p>
<p>Henry Augustus Adrian, during his<lb/>
lecture at Chautauqua last Friday af-<lb/>
ternoon spoke of great men of differ-<lb/>
ent countries, men who did more for<lb/>
humanity than did great soldiers who<lb/>
directed armies from a safe distance<lb/>
behind the firing line, and he gave<lb/>
names of many men who deserve<lb/>
more credit and honor than do states-<lb/>
men or warriors. Among these he<lb/>
mentioned the name of a French doc-<lb/>
tor who gave his life in research<lb/>
to discover the cause of yellow fever<lb/>
and to find a remedy to combat the<lb/>
disease. He went into the swamps of<lb/>
the islands of the Carribeban sea,<lb/>
where the readly mosquitoes bred,<lb/>
and with their death germs carried<lb/>
disease to human beings, and there he<lb/>
prosecuted his research work for the<lb/>
good of mankind, discovering causes<lb/>
and remedies which have saved many<lb/>
thousands of lives. Through this<lb/>
work the great doctor lost his life,<lb/>
dying in Havana, Cuba, while experi-<lb/>
menting with yellow fever germs, and<lb/>
in many large cities monuments have<lb/>
been erected to his memory. The<lb/>
speaker stated that Dr. Lezear was a<lb/>
greater man than Napoleon; a great-<lb/>
er man even than Dr. Pasteur, whose<lb/>
fame is world-wide; in fact, Lazear<lb/>
was the greatest man that France has<lb/>
ever known.</p>
<p>That great man was Jesse W. La-<lb/>
zear, who, as a boy lived in Waverly,<lb/>
and with G. O. VanDerveer and Julian<lb/>
Ruddick, worked in the German-<lb/>
American Savings Bank in this city.<lb/>
He was a nephew of Mr. and Mrs. R.<lb/>
W. Sweitzer, the gentleman being at<lb/>
that time cashier of the bank.</p>
<p>Young Lazear was of French par-<lb/>
entage and came to this country to<lb/>
study medicine at the John Hopkins<lb/>
University, and during his vacation<lb/>
time he came to Waverly to visit and<lb/>
was a guest in the J. H. Bowman<lb/>
home, and found employment in the<lb/>
bank, of which Mr. Bowman was then<lb/>
president. After completing his edu-<lb/>
cation in America, he returned to<lb/>
France and took a course in research<lb/>
work. In the late 80's he again came<lb/>
to this country and became a citizen<lb/>
of the United States. With the out-<lb/>
break of the Spanish-American war,<lb/>
he went to Cuba, and there, with<lb/>
other physicians connected with the<lb/>
army, he began his research work to<lb/>
discover the cause of yellow fever.<lb/>
Many experiments were made with<lb/>
the insects, which were permitted to<lb/>
bite volunteers, and among these vol-<lb/>
unteers was Dr. Lazear. At first, al-<lb/>
though others were stricken with the<lb/>
deadly disease, it did not manifest<lb/>
itself in his case. However, on Sep-<lb/>
tember 13, 1900, he was bitten by a<lb/>
mosquito in a hospital in Havana,<lb/>
where yellow fever patients were be-<lb/>
ing treated. Five days later he came<lb/>
down with a chill, and on the 25th of<lb/>
the same month he died. He had ac-<lb/>
complished his purpose before death<lb/>
claimed him. His theory that the<lb/>
disease was caused by mosquitoes<lb/>
was proven, and he sacrificed his life<lb/>
for the sake of humanity.</p>
<p>Mr. Adrian, when he delivered his<lb/>
address, did not know that this cele-<lb/>
brated doctor had once lived here, or<lb/>
he would have used the fact in his<lb/>
lecture. Many of our citizens will<lb/>
remember Jesse Lazear as a bank<lb/>
clerk, and this item will be of inter-<lb/>
est to them.</p>
