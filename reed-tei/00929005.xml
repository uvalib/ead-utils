<salute>Dear Doctor Carter:</salute>
</opener>
<p>What is your opinion as to the probability<lb/>
or the possibility of the existence of yellow fever<lb/>
&ldquo;carriers&rdquo;. By &ldquo;Carriers&rdquo; I mean humans who have been<lb/>
infected with the disease, and who may be able to infect<lb/>
mosquitos to such a degree that such infected mosquitos<lb/>
may transmit the disease to susceptible humans. The<lb/>
&ldquo;carrier&rdquo; may have had the disease, or he may exhibit the<lb/>
disease by symptoms, so ill-defined as to make diagnosis<lb/>
difficult. Or again the &ldquo;carrier&rdquo;, one might conceive,<lb/>
could have a latent infection, with the leptospiri so<lb/>
attentuated, as to be incapable of infecting mosquitos<lb/>
until conditions were such as to greatly increase<lb/>
both in numbers and in virility, and at such time be<lb/>
able to infect mosquitos.</p>
<p>I of course appreciate that the bacteriology<lb/>
of the disease runs positively against the possibility<lb/>
of the existence of so-called &ldquo;carriers&rdquo;. But yellow<lb/>
fever does not seem to be at so great a variance with<lb/>
other mosquito borne disease as to definitely preclude<lb/>
the &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; theory, I have never heard you discuss<lb/>
the subject and I would like you to tell me <unclear>an</unclear> answering<lb/>
the following questions.</p>
<p><del>1st. Is the <unclear>possibility</unclear> of &ldquo;carriers&rdquo;</del></p>

Dr. F. Castillo Najera.</p>
<p>1st. Is there, in your opinion, any substantial<lb/>
reason for believing that yellow fever &ldquo;carriers&rdquo;<lb/>
do not exist?</p>
<p>2nd. Has your experience at any time suggested that<lb/>
&ldquo;carriers&rdquo; might be a factor in the epidemiology of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>3rd. Have you known of any patient having had<lb/>
yellow fever a second time? If you have known<lb/>
such a case, was the <unclear>second</unclear> attack a new infection<lb/>
or was it a recrudesence of the infection, latent<lb/>
from the previous attack?</p>
<p>I have had my interest in the possibility<lb/>
of the existence of &ldquo;carriers&rdquo; renewed by the appear-<lb/>
ance of a case of yellow fever, in an area in which it<lb/>
has been endemic, and which had a formidable epidemic<lb/>
in August and September of last year. The <unclear>patient</unclear> was<lb/>
a native of the Mexican plateau, and had never been<lb/>
in the &ldquo;tierras calientas&rdquo; but on one previous occasin<lb/>
and then but for a short time. He was 28 years of age<lb/>
and had come down to the sugar plantation two months<lb/>
ago in January. He became ill on the 20th, of March<lb/>
and exhibited definite symptoms all the way through<lb/>
the disease. I saw him on the 25th, he was convalescent<lb/>
on the 26th and 27th, and a telegram received to-day<lb/>
advises that he has fully recovered.</p>
<p>This hacienda was infected in Septmber of<lb/>
last year. It has a total population of 1600 people<lb/>
when the cane cutting is in full blast and the mill<lb/>
is running. This year the non-immune population, and<lb/>

by that, I mean laborers and their families brought<lb/>
to the Hacienda from the States of the Mexican plateau<lb/>
number, not to exceed 150. The stegomyia index was low<lb/>
about 6% house infection. The health of the community<lb/>
during the past six months has been better than for<lb/>
the same period in previous years. No case has been<lb/>
reported since last September from that hacienda or<lb/>
closer than the Cross case, last December, at Tuxtepec<lb/>
some 75 miles distant.</p>
<p>The possibilty of any mosquito, infected during<lb/>
the epidemic of last Septmber living through the<lb/>
time intervening and infecting this patient could<lb/>
be ruled out. I cannot say that unrecognised cases<lb/>
have occurred in this hacienda during the months,<lb/>
intervening since last September. That seems to be<lb/>
the only explanation of the appearance of this case.<lb/>
The <unclear>hacienda</unclear> physcian, Doctor Dupinnet, insists that<lb/>
he has seen no evidences of yellow fever since last<lb/>
September other than this case.</p>
<p>No secondary infection has occurred. The place<lb/>
was promptly cleaned up, and the patient's house and<lb/>
neighboring houses were fumigated in the hopes of<lb/>
destroying infected mosquitoes. The patient was<lb/>
promptly isolated. The non - immune population is <unclear>sm</unclear><lb/>
small, and at this writing 17 days after the patient<lb/>
became ill, no other cases have developed.</p>
<p>I am sorry to trouble you with this long<lb/>
letter, but aside from giving you something new to<lb/>
teach me, the thought of talking over some subject<lb/>

like this with you, even by correspondence, lends<lb/>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell and Henry, who is growing into man-<lb/>
