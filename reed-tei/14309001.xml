<p>I have a feeling in<lb/>
my inner consciousness that<lb/>
I have been very remiss to<lb/>
the best of grans in not<lb/>
answering promptly and at<lb/>
length your lovely letter of<lb/>
about June 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I send<lb/>
a preliminary note as the<lb/>
diplomats say but have not<lb/>
yet got around to a regular<lb/>
letter- This morning things<lb/>
seen to be propitious. I am<lb/>
shaved and dressed by seven<lb/>
and am the only one up<lb/>
except Martha who is<lb/>
flourishing around in her<lb/>
nighty in the bed room and<lb/>
is up to all sorts of mis-<lb/>
chief I have no doubt.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14309002"/>
The little madre is sleeping<lb/>
on both <unclear>ears</unclear>, and will not<lb/>
appear for an hour yet-<lb/>
The mornings here are really<lb/>
delightful and I enjoy them<lb/>
very much- It has been so<lb/>
long since I have had<lb/>
either the time or the access<lb/>
to books &amp; journals so as to<lb/>
be able to do any profes-<lb/>
sional reading that I devote<lb/>
my mornings before breakfast<lb/>
to my medical journals<lb/>
and take great delight in<lb/>
it. As yet I have no profes-<lb/>
sional books here but hope<lb/>
in the fullness of time to<lb/>
get some from my friend<lb/>
the S.G- was not the death<lb/>
of Clendenin a shock to you<lb/>
we felt it very much and<lb/>
have been so anxious to hear<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14309003"/>
something of Mrs Clendenin but without result as<lb/>
yet. The Santiago outbreak has given me<lb/>
much food for thought, and I am now<lb/>
resigned and willing for the girls to go north<lb/>
at the end of this month- You see at Santiago<lb/>
they had every advantage - a year's possession<lb/>
of the town, abundance of money &amp; greatest<lb/>
of all a broad intelligent Dept. Commander<lb/>
in Wood &amp; one with the professional knowl-<lb/>
edge to know what to do- And he did<lb/>
a good job I have no doubt, yet in due<lb/>
time along comes Yellow Jack and all<lb/>
they could do was to take to the woods-<lb/>
It is curious that Wood with his broad<lb/>
and scientific methods should have got<lb/>
the first turn-down while Ludlow with<lb/>
his electrozone, and my chief who is<lb/>
blinder than a blue-eyed cat to sanitary<lb/>
necessities, should have easy sailing-<lb/>
It all shows how little is yet know of<lb/>
this mysterious disease- However yellow<lb/>
fever does not worry me one half so<lb/>
much as that pest of camps typhoid-<lb/>
But Gen. Brooke unfortunately <add>is</add> just the<lb/>
other way and as he runs this depart-<lb/>
ment as if it were a small post and<lb/>
allows Gen. Lee no freedom of action<lb/>
whatever, you can see that my power<lb/>
of effecting any good is small indeed-<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14309004"/>
Chief Surgeon's Office.<lb/>
HEADQUARTERS SEVENTH ARMY CORPS.<lb/>
It is especially so now as<lb/>
I have again offended<lb/>
his nibs, by being one of a<lb/>
board of officers to exam-<lb/>
ine the new barracks at<lb/>
Camp Columbia- We handled<lb/>
the stupid sanitary defects<lb/>
&amp; the parsimony where they<lb/>
should have been generous<lb/>
without gloves, &amp; old B, is<lb/>
wild with rage- He wrote<lb/>
to Gen. Lee that we showed<lb/>
ignorance, impracticability<lb/>
&amp; insubordination- They<lb/>
in an official paper con<lb/>
stitute my strong language.<lb/>
The General wrote back that<lb/>
we showed nothing of the<lb/>
sort - that he had examined<lb/>
the Barracks and every<lb/>
word was true etc-</p>
<pb n="5" id="f14309005"/>
<p>In spite of sanitary arrange-<lb/>
ments which are simply<lb/>
<hi>deadly</hi> Gen. Lee is ordered<lb/>
to put his troops in them<lb/>
at once. I have protested<lb/>
against his doing so until<lb/>
the defects are remedied-<lb/>
It is a pretty fight!</p>
<p>As an example of their stupid-<lb/>
ity the porches are built<lb/>
in this climate <hi>without</hi> roofs<lb/>
in order to save a little<lb/>
sheet iron roofing- On the<lb/>
other hand they have revol-<lb/>
ving doors every 15 feet<lb/>
which cost <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>46 <unclear>dollars a piece</unclear><lb/>
&amp; are worth about $8-</p>
<p>You see Mums - (as Dr. Shine<lb/>
used to call you) you always<lb/>
take such interest or appear<lb/>
to take it, in the matters that<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14309006"/>
I am interested in, that you bring down on<lb/>
your head torrents of shop like this-<lb/>
Louise vows that I have talked nothing<lb/>
but <hi>sewers</hi> for three months- Well<lb/>
thank Heaven I have won that fight<lb/>
and am much indebted to Col. Black<lb/>
for backing me up with his professional<lb/>
opinion- I am that grateful that I<lb/>
will give him an electrozone certificate<lb/>
if he asks for it-</p>
<p>You will of course know before this reaches<lb/>
you of poor Woodruffs death of Yellow<lb/>
Fever- How fatal it has been among the<lb/>
officers. I have not heard yet of any<lb/>
who has recovered- Poor Mrs. Woodruff<lb/>
do you remember how she carried on about<lb/>
this war- He always looked to me as<lb/>
if his kidneys were not sound, and<lb/>
in yellow fever the only hope is in their<lb/>
activity- I have not had a line from<lb/>
Liggett &amp; dont ever know where he<lb/>
is stationed-</p>
<p>Here is Martha to go with me to the<lb/>
P. O. &amp; get this into the 8 oclock mail<lb/>
bag- She sends her love to gran &amp;<lb/>
says &ldquo;tell her I love her so much&rdquo;- Love to<lb/>
the girls &amp; Mrs. Y.</p>
