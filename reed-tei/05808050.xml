Mrs. George S. H. Carroll<lb/>
2814 Rhode Island Avenue N.E.<lb/>
Washington, D. C.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Mrs. Carroll:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I appreciated so very much your courtesy to me during my recent visit.<lb/>
I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity of looking over Doctor Carroll's<lb/>
data even though I had such a limited opportunity to study it. I hope<lb/>
that you feel as I do - satisfied that at least a beginning has been<lb/>
made in the proper study and disposition of this material. I hope also<lb/>
that the day spent with me was not too tiresome for you and that per-<lb/>
haps you even enjoyed it a bit. I think it is always helpful to be<lb/>
able to talk over one's problems with a sympathetic friend. Certainly<lb/>
you have a very difficult problem to face and I do hope that I can help<lb/>
in some way. I shall shortly write a little note to your minister but<lb/>
I want to compose the letter carefully and will not write it hastily.</p>
<p>I am having copied the few photographs which you kindly loaned to me.<lb/>
I am not treating these in a routine manner but am consulting the head<lb/>
of our photographic department about them. The photographs are, in my<lb/>
opinion, most interesting and useful as I have not seen photographs<lb/>
taken from that particular angle. In one of the photographs there are<lb/>
two or three little buildings that I am anxious to have show up in the<lb/>
copy. They are very faint and we may have to photograph them more than<lb/>
once and indeed we may have to retouch it; however it will be done by<lb/>
experts and if our local man cannot do it, I will consult the Eastman<lb/>
Kodak Store in Minneapolis. Rest assured that these photographs will<lb/>
be safe in my hands and returned to you. I will not only return the<lb/>
originals to you (unless you later decide to present them to the<lb/>
yellow fever museum of which I have told you so much) but I will send<lb/>
you copies of these so that not only you but your husband's two sisters<lb/>
may have them if you wish to send them. I will send them all to you.</p>
<p>I asked you whether you had a copy of Dr. Howard Kelly's book on Walter<lb/>
Reed and yellow fever. Certainly there was none in the trunks and I do<lb/>
think you ought to have one. I have an extra copy and am happy indeed<lb/>
to send it to you by separate post.</p>
<p>I am of course anxious to return to Washington or to make some arrange-<lb/>
ments which will be satisfactory to you with regard to photostating all<lb/>
of the material in the one box with the data of greater importance. I<lb/>
hope to get to Washington some time later this year, but it will not be<lb/>
until fall at least. Would you be willing, meanwhile, to let me do the<lb/>
following: One of my former Mayo Clinic secretaries, Miss Dorma Schnurr,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f05808051"/>
Mrs. George S. H. Carroll<lb/>
- 2 -<lb/>
February 26, 1954<lb/>
has lived in Washington for several years. She is a very able person<lb/>
and, incidentally, takes shorthand. Would you be willing to let me<lb/>
have her make the arrangements with a photostat company, making a date<lb/>
to suit your mutual convenience and then would you let her come for you,<lb/>
take you down town and together you two could be there while the photo-<lb/>
stats are being made. Or if you do not want to bother, Miss Schnurr<lb/>
could come to your home, make a quick catalog of the material in the<lb/>
one box and take it herself to the photostat company down town, re-<lb/>
turning it the same day if the photostatic company can do it all in<lb/>
one day.</p>
<p>I am so happy for your cooperation in this matter because our purposes<lb/>
are the same - to show the world just exactly what Doctor Carroll did,<lb/>
and without access to the material you have, I know that my story about<lb/>
Doctor Carroll's activities would be incomplete.</p>
<p>When I catch my breath, I will send you a rough list of the material we<lb/>
found in the trunks with extra copies which you may or may not give to<lb/>
your lawyer and to Mr. Carroll's two sisters, depending on your own<lb/>
decision in the matter. I will not correspond with his sisters or<lb/>
with your lawyer about this matter, although in the near future I<lb/>
would like to send to your lawyer two of my reprints so that he may<lb/>
see how very interested I am in the yellow fever work. I do not want<lb/>
to delay sending you the Kelly book until the list of material in the<lb/>
trunks is finished or the photographs copied. These will be along<lb/>
in due time.</p>

<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
