<p>duty in the Surgeon General's<lb/>
office. Maj. Hoff has taken<lb/>
his place. You must be sure<lb/>
to call on them- They will<lb/>
be in Washington during<lb/>
the early part of the New Year.<lb/>
This afternoon at 5 o'clock,<lb/>
I went to the Stark's to see<lb/>
the Christmas-Tree which Mrs<lb/>
Stark and Mrs. Kean had pre-<lb/>
pared for the children- In<lb/>
addition to presents for the chil-<lb/>
dren, there was a present for<lb/>
Dr Kean, Dr Stark, Capt. Slo-<lb/>
cunn, Maj. Dunn, Dr Allen<lb/>
and myself- What do you<lb/>
suppose mine was? A<lb/>
<hi>big mosquito</hi>, with these lines<lb/>
attached:</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>&ldquo;over the plains of Cuba,</l>
<l>Roams the mosquito wild,</l>
<pb n="2" id="f02257002"/>
<l>No one can catch or tame her,</l>
<l>For she is Nature's child.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>With Yellow Jack she fills herself,</l>
<l>And none her pleasure mar,</l>
<l>Till Major Reed does Capture her,</l>
<l>And puts her in a jar!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And now alas! for Culex,</l>
<l>She has our sympath-y,</l>
<l>For since the Major spotted her,</l>
<l>She longs to be a flea&rdquo;!</l>
</lg>
<p>The reading of these lines<lb/>
by Mrs. Slocunn &ldquo;brought<lb/>
down the house&rdquo;, and I had<lb/>
to accept Miss Culex with<lb/>
many blushes- As the punch<lb/>
was very enjoyable, the oc-<lb/>
casion was anything but<lb/>
dull- To-night a big hop is<lb/>
going on in the Post, but<lb/>
I don't care to take it in.<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f02257003"/>
And now I must tell you some-<lb/>
thing about my latest ex-<lb/>
periment and how it is turn-<lb/>
ing out- You already know<lb/>
that I have had constructed<lb/>
two houses- Each 14 ft. x 20 ft-<lb/>
Both tightly sealed inside,<lb/>
and so screened both as to<lb/>
windows &amp; by double-doors<lb/>
that no flying insect can get<lb/>
either <hi>in</hi>, if he comes from<lb/>
the outside; or <hi>out</hi>, if he<lb/>
or she is once put within-<lb/>
Building No. 1 has only one<lb/>
large room- In this my non-<lb/>
immune individuals sleep<lb/>
every night and by day rest<lb/>
in a tent near by &amp; take<lb/>
things calmly- Dr Cooke and<lb/>
2 Hospital Corps men have<lb/>
just come out of Quarantine<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02257004"/>
after spending 20 nights <del>there</del><lb/>
<add>in Building no. 1-</add> in the midst of very much<lb/>
soiled yellow fever bedding-<lb/>
Two other young americans<lb/>
are now keeping there in<lb/>
the beds &amp; clothing that our<lb/>
yellow fever cases have<lb/>
just vacated- So much<lb/>
for building No. 1-</p>
<p>Building no. 2 stands across<lb/>
a little valley or depression<lb/>
about 80 yards from no. 1-<lb/>
The room 14 x 20 ft. is not<lb/>
only ceiled but is lined<lb/>
throughout with cheese cloth,<lb/>
so as to be very tight- It has<lb/>
two <hi>fixed</hi> fine wire-screen<lb/>
windows and is protected by<lb/>
double wire-screen doors<lb/>
so that when one enters,<lb/>
he first opens a solid<lb/>
door, &amp; then finds himself<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f02257005"/>
in a small vestibule- Next<lb/>
he opens a wire-screen door<lb/>
swung on spring hinges &amp;<lb/>
find himself in a <hi>second</hi><lb/>
vestibule- Having closed<lb/>
this screen<del>s</del> door behind<lb/>
him, he now opens a <hi>second</hi><lb/>
screen door &amp; finds hims-<lb/>
elf in the room proper-<lb/>
This room is divided <hi>en-<lb/>
tirely across</hi> <del>by a</del> from<lb/>
floor to ceiling &amp; from wall<lb/>
to wall by a wire screen --<lb/>
so that there is a larger room<lb/>
15 x 14, <del>&ldquo;</del>the &ldquo;mosquito&rdquo; or &ldquo;infec-<lb/>
ted&rdquo; room, as I call it, and<lb/>
a smaller room 10 x 14, the<lb/>
&ldquo;non-infected room&rdquo;- This<lb/>
latter is entered by an<lb/>
entirely separate door, whereas<lb/>
the &ldquo;infected&rdquo; room can only be<lb/>
entered <del>by</del> <add>through</add> the screen-doors<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f02257006"/>
before mentioned- Thus:</p>
<p>INSERT FIGURE HERE</p>
<p>on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> at 11,35 a.m. we liberated<lb/>
15 infected mosquitoes in the larger<lb/>
room, and at 11.55 a.m. a young<lb/>
american entered the room &amp;<lb/>
lay on the bed marked &ldquo;A&rdquo; for<lb/>
30 minutes during which time seve-<lb/>
ral mosquitoes bit him- I stood<lb/>
with Dr Carroll &amp; Dr Ames on the other<lb/>
side of the screen at the place marked<lb/>
B &amp; saw the insect &ldquo;light&rdquo; &amp; begin work<lb/>
within 5 minutes from the time he<lb/>
entered- The same afternoon at<lb/>
4.15 o'clock, he again went in &amp;<lb/>
was again bitten -- remained 20<lb/>
minutes- Bed marked &ldquo;B&rdquo; is being<lb/>
occupied by a non-immune who<lb/>
sleeps within one foot of the<lb/>
screen, breathing the same air<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f02257007"/>
as in room with bed &ldquo;A&rdquo; --<lb/>
(infected room)- This young<lb/>
non-immune is quite well,<lb/>
but the young fellow who went<lb/>
in on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>, was suddenly<lb/>
stricken to-day at noon (-just<lb/>
four days after he entered<lb/>
&amp; was bitten-) with a sharp<lb/>
attack of what promises to be<lb/>
Yellow Fever! The Board of<lb/>
Experts will see him tomorrow<lb/>
&amp; make their diagnosis- His<lb/>
temperature, this evening, is 104&deg;<lb/>
&amp; all of his symptoms point plainly<lb/>
to yellow fever. Could any<lb/>
experiment be more striking?<lb/>
A <hi>common</hi> room, divided<lb/>
by a wire-screen, &amp; <hi>having the<lb/>
same air</hi>-<hi>infected</hi> on one<lb/>
side and <hi>not</hi> infected on the<lb/>
other side of the screen!!<lb/>
This, lovie, dear, is what I<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f02257008"/>
call the &ldquo;<hi>argumentum ad<lb/>
<unclear>hominem</unclear></hi>&rdquo;! Don't worry about<lb/>
the mosquitoes <hi>getting out</hi>, for they<lb/>
are tightly <hi>locked</hi> in &amp; the <hi>key</hi><lb/>
is in <hi>my pocket</hi>! About 3<lb/>
days from now, I shall let a<lb/>
young spaniard go in, &amp; then<lb/>
no more! Non-immunes will<lb/>
continue to sleep on the other<lb/>
side <hi>every night</hi>! Don't tell Dr<lb/>
Nash anything of this, and if you<lb/>
should meet Gen. Sternberg, don't<lb/>
tell him either- I haven't told<lb/>
anybody but to your darling<lb/>
self- I had a long letter of<lb/>
congratulation from him <add>(Gen. Sternberg)</add>, a<lb/>
few days ago, but he hates<lb/>
to give up the idea that the<lb/>
disease cannot be conveyed<lb/>
by infected clothing! Well! we<lb/>
will have to let <hi>him</hi> down <hi>easy</hi>,<lb/>
too! Good-night, you precious,<lb/>
sweet oomsey dear! Boo! Boo!<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f02257009"/>
<hi>Wednesday morning -- 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>. at this<lb/>
rate, it won't be long before<lb/>
the year <del>189</del> 1900 will have<lb/>
passed- I can't say that I will<lb/>
be real sorry to have it go,<lb/>
since it has kept me away<lb/>
from my precious Miss Gouty<lb/>
so very much- I do hope that<lb/>
I can be with my joys a<lb/>
little more in 1901- January<lb/>
should soon slip by and then<lb/>
it won't be long before I<lb/>
can start home- I suppose<lb/>
that dear little daughter has<lb/>
gone to Helen's house and that<lb/>
she is enjoying herself very<lb/>
much- Bless her precious heart,<lb/>
father must write to her<lb/>
and acknowledge receipt of<lb/>
that sweet picture, for it was<lb/>
such a good one of his dear<lb/>
sweet baby- I hear the<lb/>
mail-wagon coming, lovie,<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f02257010"/>
dear, so that I must hurry<lb/>
up &amp; close this- Your darling<lb/>
letters come very regularly<lb/>
now, &amp; I enjoy them so much-<lb/>
Take care of your precious<lb/>
self and don't get <hi>too</hi> lonely<lb/>
while little lamb is away<lb/>
from you- Boo! Boo!</p>
<p>With love &amp; kisses &amp; kisses<lb/>
&amp; love for my dear, sweet<lb/>
girls,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Devotedly,</salute>
<signed>Papa</signed>,
A hug for old Mr D. Johnson,<lb/>
Love to the ladies.
