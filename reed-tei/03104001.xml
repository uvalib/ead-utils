<salute>My dear Dr Kelly:</salute>
</opener>
<p>There has just been brought to my attention, information regarding the condition of<lb/>
John R Kissenger, the first volunteer in the yellow fever research under Dr Walter<lb/>
Reed, and I think that you will want to know about the situation.</p>
<p>Mr Kissenger is now living in a little house at Andrews (Huntington County), Indiana,<lb/>
with inadequate income, and incapable of doing more than occasional low-grade work,<lb/>
such as helping his wife with the wash or puttering around the garden.</p>
<p>It seems that he had been forced to move from his previous home in Michigan and to lose<lb/>
part of his pension because he had antagonized many of his neighbors through his in-<lb/>
sistence upon the honest enforcement of the Volstead Act.</p>
<p>While it may never be established that Mr Kissenger's nervous troubles are in any way<lb/>
related to the yellow fever acquired in the course of the experiment, and while there<lb/>
seems to be lack of unanimity in this country as to the desirability of enforcing all<lb/>
our laws without discrimination, it seems to me that there ought to be enough interest<lb/>
and resources available in this country to ensure Mr Kissenger against worry and the<lb/>
serious discomfort to which he is now subjected. I have looked over some of Mr Kissenger's<lb/>
correspondence over a period of years, and they all breathe the same spirit as that<lb/>
manifested at the time when Major Reed saluted the volunteers for their devoted accept-<lb/>
ance of the risks of the experiment and refusal to consider monetary compensation.<lb/>
There is no note of complaint and yet his condition has been precarious aside from his<lb/>
physical suffering for many years.</p>
<p>I am writing to ask what you think ought to be done to relieve the situation - and who<lb/>
ought to do it. I am assuming that it is futile to wait for Congressional action, both<lb/>
because of the delay this would involve, and because of the disgraceful record that our<lb/>
Congress has made for itself in the past in connection with this case. Please let me<lb/>
hear from you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>With very kind greetings,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very truly,</salute>
