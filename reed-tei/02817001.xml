<p>MAJOR REED'S WORK IN HAVANA;</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>How He Proved That Yellow Fever Is Transmitted Only<lb/>
By One Species Of Mosquito And That Articles<lb/>
Used Or Soiled By Patients Do Not<lb/>
Carry Infection.</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>Non-immunes Slept for Days in Soiled Bedding of Yellow Fever Cases, in Sealed<lb/>
Room, With No III Effect--Afterwards Promptly Infected by Mosquito--The Sub-<lb/>
sequent Campaign in Havana--Yellow Fever Wiped Out There After 150 Years<lb/>
Supremacy.</p>


<p>The appearance of yellow fever in<lb/>
New Orleans and the determination of<lb/>
Dr. White, head of the Federal forces<lb/>
sent here, of the State and City Boards<lb/>
of Health and of practically the whole<lb/>
of the medical fraternity to appeal to<lb/>
the whole community for co-operation<lb/>
in the effort to apply successfully the<lb/>
dogma that yellow fever is transmit-<lb/>
ted only by a certain species of mos-<lb/>
quito has aroused intense interest in<lb/>
the subject of the causation of yellow<lb/>
fever epidemics. Some details are<lb/>
given here of the wonderful results of<lb/>
the experiments of the commission<lb/>
headed by Major Walter Reed of the<lb/>
United States Army in Cuba, results<lb/>
which, it is claimed, have enabled the<lb/>
authorities to make Havana, the home<lb/>
of yellow fever, practically immune<lb/>
after 150 years of constant fever. The<lb/>
whole credit of the development of the<lb/>
theory into a scientific fact is due to<lb/>
Major Reed, who, with other officers<lb/>
and privates of the United States<lb/>
Army, risked their lives in the demon-<lb/>
stration. Assistant Surgeon Lazear<lb/>
lost his life in the attempt. Major<lb/>
Reed succumbed three years ago to an<lb/>
attack of appendicitis in the city of<lb/>
Washington.</p>
<p>Major Reed a Brilliant Virginian.</p>
<p>Major Walter Reed was born in<lb/>
Gloucester county, Virginia, in 1851.<lb/>
He was the son of the Rev. Lemuel<lb/>
Sutton Reed. He received a fair pri-<lb/>
mary education and then went to the<lb/>
University of Virginia to study medi-<lb/>
cine, graduating in 1868, when only 17<lb/>
years of age. He secured a second<lb/>
degree at Bellevue Medical College in<lb/>
New York and then served in the<lb/>
Brooklyn and Blackwell's Island Hos-<lb/>
pital. Before he was 21 he was a<lb/>
district physician in New York, and at<lb/>
22 was one of the five inspectors of<lb/>
the Board of Health of Brooklyn. He<lb/>
went into the United States Army as<lb/>
Assistant Surgeon with the rank of<lb/>
First Lieutenant in 1875, and during<lb/>
the next eighteen years served in Ari-<lb/>
zona, Nebraska, Dakota and in the<lb/>
Southern and Eastern States. He was<lb/>
always an indefatigable student and a<lb/>
pioneer. In 1890 he went to Balti-<lb/>
more, working in the laboratories of<lb/>
Johns Hopkins University. In 1893 he<lb/>
was made surgeon with the rank of<lb/>
Major and was detailed in Washing-<lb/>
ton as Curator of the Army Medical<lb/>
Museum and Professor of Bacteriology<lb/>
at the Army Medical School. He won<lb/>
high praise for his writings and be-<lb/>
came an expert in investigating the<lb/>
causes of epidemic diseases at mili-<lb/>
tary posts and in making sanitary in-<lb/>
spections. During the Spanish-Amer-<lb/>
ican war he was selected as the head<lb/>
of a board to study the causation and<lb/>
spread of typhoid in the camps of the<lb/>
volunteer troops, and the report of the<lb/>
commission, a monumental work, is<lb/>
now in course of publication by the<lb/>
Government and is expected to serve<lb/>
as a basis for future study of the epi-<lb/>
demiology of typhoid fever.</p>
<p>His great work in Cuba, in demon-<lb/>
strating that yellow fever is trans-<lb/>
mitted by the mosquito, is thus briefly<lb/>
described in a memoir published last<lb/>
year by the Walter Reed Memorial<lb/>
Association at Washington.</p>
<p>Sent to Cuba to Study Yellow Fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In June, 1900, Major Reed was sent<lb/>
to Cuba as president of a board to<lb/>
study the infectious diseases of the<lb/>
country, but more especially yellow<lb/>
fever. Associated with him were Act-<lb/>
ing Assistant Surgeons James Carroll,<lb/>
Jesse W. Lazear and A. Agramonte.<lb/>
At this time the American authorities<lb/>
in Cuba had for a year and a half en-<lb/>
deavored to diminish the disease and<lb/>
mortality of the Cuban towns by gen-<lb/>
eral sanitary work, but while the<lb/>
health of the population showed dis-<lb/>
tinct improvement and the mortality<lb/>
had greatly diminished, yellow fever<lb/>
apparently had been entirely unaffect-<lb/>
ed by these measures. In fact, owing<lb/>
to the large number of non-immune<lb/>
foreigners, the disease was more fre-<lb/>
quent than usual in Havana and in<lb/>
Quemados, near the camp of Ameri-<lb/>
can troops, and many valuable lives of<lb/>
American officers and soldiers had<lb/>
been lost.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f02817003"/>
<p>C1</p>
<p>B2</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reed was convinced from the first<lb/>
that general sanitary measures alone<lb/>
would not check the disease, but that<lb/>
its transmission was partly due to an<lb/>
insect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that malarial fever, caused<lb/>
by an animal parasite in the blood, is<lb/>
transmitted from man to man through<lb/>
the agency of certain mosquitoes had<lb/>
been recently accepted by the scien-<lb/>
tific world; also, several years before,<lb/>
Dr. Carlos Finlay of Havana had ad-<lb/>
vanced the theory that a mosquito<lb/>
conveyed the unknown cause of yel-<lb/>
low fever, but did not succeed in<lb/>
demonstrating the truth of his theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. H. R. Carter of the Marine Hos-<lb/>
pital Service had written a paper<lb/>
showing that although the period of<lb/>
incubation was only five days, yet a<lb/>
house to which a patient was carried<lb/>
did not become infected for from fif-<lb/>
teen to twenty days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Reed's mind this indicated that<lb/>
the unknown infective agent has to<lb/>
undergo a period of incubation of from<lb/>
ten to fifteen days and probably in the<lb/>
body of the biting insect.</p>
<p>Sanarelli Theory Disproved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to this time the most generally<lb/>
accepted theory as to the causation of<lb/>
yellow fever was that of Sanarelli,<lb/>
who claimed that the bacillus icete-<lb/>
roids discovered by him was the speci-<lb/>
fic agent of the disease. Major Reed,<lb/>
in association with Dr. Carroll, had,<lb/>
however, already demonstrated that<lb/>
this bacillus was one widely dissemi-<lb/>
nated in the United States, and bore<lb/>
no such relation to yellow fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In June, July and August, 1900, the<lb/>
commission gave their entire attention<lb/>
to the bacteriological study of the<lb/>
blood of yellow fever patients and the<lb/>
postmorten examination of the organs<lb/>
of those dying of the disease. In<lb/>
twenty-four cases where the blood was<lb/>
repeatedly examined, as well as in<lb/>
eleven carefully studied autopsies,<lb/>
bacillus iceteroids were not discov-<lb/>
ered, nor was there any indication of<lb/>
the presence in the blood of a specific<lb/>
cause of the disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Application was made to General<lb/>
Leonard Wood, the military governor<lb/>
of Cuba, for permission to conduct ex-<lb/>
periments on non-immune persons, and<lb/>
a liberal sum of money requested for<lb/>
the purpose of rewarding volunteers<lb/>
who would submit themselves to ex-<lb/>
periment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was indeed fortunate that the<lb/>
military governor of Cuba was a man<lb/>
who, by his breadth of mind and spe-<lb/>
cial scientific training, could readily<lb/>
appreciate the arguments of Major<lb/>
Reed as to the value of the proposed<lb/>
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money and full authority to proceed<lb/>
were promptly granted, and to the<lb/>
everlasting glory of the American sol-<lb/>
dier, volunteers from the army offered<lb/>
themselves for experiment in plenty,<lb/>
and with the utmost fearlessness.</p>
<p>Dr. Lazear Dies a Hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the arrangements were en-<lb/>
tirely completed Dr. Carroll, a member<lb/>
of the commission, allowed himself to<lb/>
be bitten by a mosquito that twelve<lb/>
days previously had filled itself with<lb/>
the blood of a yellow fever patient.<lb/>
He suffered from a very severe attack,<lb/>
and his was the first experimental<lb/>
case. Dr. Lazear also experimented on<lb/>
himself at the same time, but was not<lb/>
infected. Some days later, while in<lb/>
the yellow fever ward, he was bitten<lb/>
by a mosquito and noted the fact care-<lb/>
fully. He acquired the disease in its<lb/>
most terrible form and died a martyr<lb/>
to science and a true hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other fatality occurred among<lb/>
the brave men who in the course of the<lb/>
experiments willingly exposed them-<lb/>
selves to the infection of the dreaded<lb/>
disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A camp was especially constructed<lb/>
for the experiments, about four miles<lb/>
from Havana, christened Camp Lazear<lb/>
in honor of the dead comrade. The<lb/>
inmates of the camp were put into<lb/>
most rigid quarantine and ample time<lb/>
was allowed to eliminate any possibil-<lb/>
ity of the disease being brought in<lb/>
from Havana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The personnel consisted of three<lb/>
nurses and nine non-immunes, all in<lb/>
the military service, and included two<lb/>
physicians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From time to time Spanish immi-<lb/>
grants, newly arrived, were brought in<lb/>
from the immigrant station; a person<lb/>
not known to be immune was not al-<lb/>
lowed to leave camp, or if he did was<lb/>
forbidden to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most complete record was kept<lb/>
of the health of every man to be ex-<lb/>
perimented upon, thus eliminating the<lb/>
possibility of any other disease than<lb/>
yellow fever complicating the case.</p>
<p>The Wonderful Experiments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mosquitoes used were especial-<lb/>
ly bred from the eggs and kept in a<lb/>
building screened by wire netting.<lb/>
When an insect was wanted for an ex-<lb/>
periment it was taken into a yellow<lb/>
fever hospital and allowed to fill itself<lb/>
with the blood of a patient; afterward,<lb/>
at varying intervals from the time of<lb/>
this meal of blood it was purposely ap-<lb/>
plied to non-immunes in camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In December five cases of the dis-<lb/>
ease were developed as the result of<lb/>
such applications, in January three<lb/>
and in February two, making in all ten,<lb/>
exclusive of the cases of Drs. Carroll<lb/>
and Lazear. Immediately upon the<lb/>
pearance of the first recognized<lb/>
symptoms of the disease, in any one<lb/>
of these experimental cases, the pa-<lb/>
tient was taken from Camp Lazear to a<lb/>
yellow fever hospital, one mile distant.<lb/>
Every person in camp was rigidly pro-<lb/>
tected from accidental mosquito bites,<lb/>
and not in a single instance did yellow<lb/>
fever develop in the camp except at the<lb/>
will of the experimenters. The experi-<lb/>
ments were conducted at a season<lb/>
when there was the least chance of<lb/>
naturally acquiring the disease and the<lb/>
mosquitoes used were kept active by<lb/>
maintaining them at a summer temper-<lb/>
ature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A completely mosquito-proof build-<lb/>
ing was divided into two compartments<lb/>
by a wire screen partition; infected<lb/>
insects were liberated on one side only.<lb/>
A brave non-immune entered and re-<lb/>
mained long enough to allow himself<lb/>
to be bitten several times. He was at-<lb/>
tacked by yellow fever, while two sus-<lb/>
ceptible men in the other compart-<lb/>
ment did not acquire the disease, al-<lb/>
though sleeping there thirteen nights.<lb/>
This demonstrates in the simplest<lb/>
and most certain manner that the in-<lb/>
fectiousness of the building was due<lb/>
only to the presence of the insects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every attempt was made to infect<lb/>
individuals by means of bedding,<lb/>
clothes, and other articles that had<lb/>
been used and soiled by patients suf-<lb/>
fering with virulent yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Carroll's Convincing Report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally yellow fever is transmit-<lb/>
ted by the mosquito, and always and<lb/>
only by the mosquito. The harmless-<lb/>
ness of fomites has been fully demon-<lb/>
strated by our experiments in 1900 and<lb/>
1901, in which three young Americans<lb/>
slept for twenty consecutive nights in<lb/>
a room from which mosquitoes were<lb/>
excluded garnished with articles soiled<lb/>
with discharges from fatal and other<lb/>
cases of yellow fever. Three and four<lb/>
large boxes were packed and unpacked<lb/>
each morning by these non-immunes,<lb/>
who suffered no disturbance of health<lb/>
from these exposures. The room was<lb/>
twenty feet by fourteen feet, double-<lb/>
walled, tightly sealed, heated to above<lb/>
90 degrees Fahrenheit and dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two other non-immunes then occu-<lb/>
pied the room for twenty nights, while<lb/>
additional articles of bedding and<lb/>
clothing were added. They slept in<lb/>
the garments and between the sheets<lb/>
that had covered cases of yellow fever,<lb/>
some of which were fatal. The result<lb/>
of the second attempt was nil. A third<lb/>
attempt was then made with two addi-<lb/>
tional non-immunes, equally without<lb/>
success. Not the slightest indisposi-<lb/>
tion followed close and intimate con-<lb/>
tact with this repulsive material in any<lb/>
case. Temperatures and pulse rates<lb/>
were recorded at regular and frequent<lb/>
intervals. Four of these seven non-<lb/>
immunes were subsequently infected<lb/>
by blood-injections and by means of<lb/>
infected mosquitoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another kind of experiment was in-<lb/>
cluded in the Cuban investigations of<lb/>
yellow fever. A room was prepared so<lb/>
as to preclude the possibility of infec-<lb/>
tion by fomites (infected articles).<lb/>
Every article contained in the room<lb/>
had been previously disinfected and<lb/>
was thoroughly clean. The only possi-<lb/>
ble means of infection with yellow<lb/>
fever was by infected mosquitoes, lib-<lb/>
erated in the room containing the<lb/>
human subjects of the experiment.<lb/>
Yellow fever promptly followed the<lb/>
introduction of mosquitoes into the<lb/>
room.</p>
<p>The Reed memoir continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the experimental cases<lb/>
caused by mosquito bites, four non-im-<lb/>
munes were infected by injecting blood<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f02817004"/>
drawn directly from the veins of yel-<lb/>
low fever patients in the first two days<lb/>
of the disease, thus demonstrating the<lb/>
presence of an infectious agent in the<lb/>
blood at this early period of the at-<lb/>
tack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the blood serum of a patient,<lb/>
passed through a bacteria-proof filter,<lb/>
was found to be capable of causing<lb/>
yellow fever in another person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The details of the experiments are<lb/>
most interesting, but it must here suf-<lb/>
fice to briefly sum up the principal<lb/>
conclusion of this admirable board of<lb/>
investigators of which Reed was the<lb/>
master mind:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. The specific agent in the causa-<lb/>
tion of yellow fever exists in the blood<lb/>
of a patient for the first three days of<lb/>
his attack, after which time he ceases<lb/>
to be a menace to the health of others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. A mosquito of a single species,<lb/>
stegomyia faciata, ingesting the blood<lb/>
of the patient during this infective<lb/>
period is powerless to convey the dis-<lb/>
ease to another person by its bite until<lb/>
about twelve days have elapsed, but<lb/>
can do so thereafter for an indefinite<lb/>
period, probably during the remainder<lb/>
of its life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. The disease cannot be spread in<lb/>
any other way than by the bite of the<lb/>
previously infected stegomyia. Articles<lb/>
used or soiled by patients do not carry<lb/>
infection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These conclusions pointed so clear-<lb/>
ly to the practical method of extermi-<lb/>
nating the disease that they were at<lb/>
once accepted by the sanitary authori-<lb/>
ties in Cuba and put to the test in Ha-<lb/>
vana, where for nearly a century and a<lb/>
half, by actual record, the disease had<lb/>
never failed to appear annually.</p>
<p>Fever Leaves Havana After 150 Years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In February, 1901, the chief sani-<lb/>
tary officer in Havana, Major W. C.<lb/>
Gorgas, Medical Department of the<lb/>
United States army, instituted meas-<lb/>
ures to eradicate the disease, based en-<lb/>
tirely on the conclusions of the com-<lb/>
mission. Cases of yellow fever were<lb/>
required to be reported as promptly as<lb/>
possible, the patient was at first rigidly<lb/>
isolated, and immediately upon the re-<lb/>
port a force of men from the sanitary<lb/>
department visited the house. All the<lb/>
rooms of the building and of the<lb/>
neighboring houses were sealed and<lb/>
fumigated to destroy the mosquitoes<lb/>
present. Window and door screens<lb/>
were put up and after the death or re-<lb/>
covery of the patient his room was<lb/>
fumigated and every mosquito de-<lb/>
stroyed. A war of extermination was<lb/>
also waged against mosquitoes in gen-<lb/>
eral, and an energetic effort made to<lb/>
diminish the number bred by draining<lb/>
standing water, screening tanks and<lb/>
vessels, using petroleum on water that<lb/>
could not be drained, and in the most<lb/>
systematic manner destroying the<lb/>
breeding places of the insect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the warm season returned a<lb/>
few cases occurred, but by September,<lb/>
1901, the last case of yellow fever orig-<lb/>
inated in Havana, since which time the<lb/>
city has been entirely exempt from the<lb/>
terrible disease that had there kept<lb/>
strong hold for a hundred and fifty<lb/>
years. Cases are now admitted into<lb/>
Havana from Mexican ports; but are<lb/>
treated under screens with perfect im<lb/>
munity in the ordinary city hospitals<lb/>
The crusade against the insects also<lb/>
caused a very large decrease in ma-<lb/>
larial fevers.</p>
<p>More recent investigations into the<lb/>
cause and spread of yellow fever have<lb/>
only succeeded in verifying the work<lb/>
of Reed and his commission in every<lb/>
particular and adding very little to our<lb/>
knowledge of the disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later researches by Guiteras in<lb/>
Havana, by the Public Health and Ma-<lb/>
rine Hospital Service in Vera Cruz,<lb/>
and lastly by the delegation from the<lb/>
Pasteur Institute of Paris in Rio de<lb/>
Janeiro, all confirm in the most con-<lb/>
vincing manner both the accuracy and<lb/>
comprehensiveness of the conclusions<lb/>
of the American commission. It has<lb/>
been well said that Reed's experiments<lb/>
will always remain as models in the<lb/>
annals of scientific research, both for<lb/>
the exactness with which they were<lb/>
adapted to the points to be proved and<lb/>
the precautions taken that no experi-<lb/>
ment should be vitiated by failure to<lb/>
exclude all possible sources of error.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appreciation of Reed's work was<lb/>
instant in the scientific world. Honor-<lb/>
ary degrees from Harvard University<lb/>
and the University of Michigan were<lb/>
conferred upon him, learned societies<lb/>
and distinguished men delighted to<lb/>
honor him, and after his death Con<lb/>
gress voted a special pension to his<lb/>
widow.&rdquo;</p>
