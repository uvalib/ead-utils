<p>Kean reports that Reed requested $10,000 to conduct the yellow fever experiments. However, he is uncertain about where the financial records for the yellow fever study are being kept. He discusses an article written by Truby and encourages Hench to contact Thomas M. England, a former yellow fever volunteer.</p>

<salute>My dear Dr Hench-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your very interesting letter<lb/>
of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> came yesterday by air<lb/>
mail- I thought that I had told<lb/>
you that when Major Reed went to<lb/>
Gen. <add>Wood</add> to get the $10.000 that he had<lb/>
promised him in the interview that<lb/>
Reed and I had with Gen. Wood <unclear>on</unclear><lb/>
Oct. 12, Gen. Wood told Reed that,<lb/>
as he Reed was only a transient<lb/>
on duty in Cuba, he would put<lb/>
the money in <del>my</del> Kean's hands to<lb/>
be disbursed- This pleased Reed<lb/>
as he would not have the bother of<lb/>
it <add>This is I think told in the Belroi address which I sent<lb/>
you-</add>- Gen- Wood afterwards told me<lb/>
(I was not at the interview when Wood<lb/>
said this) that he would arrange<lb/>
that vouchers should not be required<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06284085"/>
AC<lb/>

because the experiments, it was plan-<lb/>
ned, should be secret. But the mat-<lb/>
ter leaked out where the Spanish<lb/>
immigants were being engaged &amp;<lb/>
a violent attack on the scheme<lb/>
was published in the Havana<lb/>
newspaper La Lucha- So I treated<lb/>
the matter as a routine disburs-<lb/>
ment, got receipts for all expendi-<lb/>
tures and filed my returns with<lb/>
the Cuban Treasury- They are pro-<lb/>
bably on file there yet if they have<lb/>
not been destroyed to make space-<lb/>
Whether all the records of the Govern-<lb/>
ment of Intervention were brought<lb/>
back to the U. S. on were left in<lb/>
Cuba I am not now certain. It<lb/>
would be the devil's own job to<lb/>
find them in either case and<lb/>
I doubt whether you could show<lb/>
adequate reasons for asking that it<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f06284086"/>
3<lb/>
be done- Personally I do not think<lb/>
it would be worth the trouble- I did<lb/>
have a little bundle of retained<lb/>
papers relating to the matter but<lb/>
where they are now I dont know-<lb/>
I will take a day off some day<lb/>
soon and put on some old clothes<lb/>
and dig around in the old papers<lb/>
that Mrs Kean has been for<lb/>
years after me to destroy- Maybe<lb/>
I will find something to send you<lb/>
Some 10 or 12 years ago I did come<lb/>
across them and took out two con-<lb/>
tracts made by Reed with two of<lb/>
the Spanish immigrants- These I<lb/>
had framed &amp; one I gave to the<lb/>
Army Med. Museum: the other I<lb/>
<unclear>hung</unclear> in my office there as Secy<lb/>
of the Assn of Military Surgeons.<lb/>
After I resigned as Secy in 1934 I<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f06284087"/>
4<lb/>
was not very well and did not go<lb/>
down to get the last of my belong-<lb/>
ings for some weeks- When I did<lb/>
so I found that the office had<lb/>
been moved across the hall and<lb/>
this framed document with Reed's<lb/>
signature and that of Antonio<lb/>
Benigno (Case 4. p. 75 of our Yellow Fever<lb/>
Book) had disappeared- Some one<lb/>
with an eye for relies had carried it<lb/>
off! The other one is I suppose better<lb/>
taken care of and is hanging some<lb/>
where about the Museum- If I can<lb/>
find any more of these contracts I<lb/>
will give you one- You ask very natur-<lb/>
ally why was rent paid for the Rojas<lb/>
field for a whole year- I dont remember<lb/>
but I think it must have been that<lb/>
Reed thought it possible that it might<lb/>
be needed for additional experiments<lb/>
the following summer- You remember<lb/>

WASHINGTON, D. C.<lb/>
that there were additional experiments<lb/>
made by Carroll the next autumn<lb/>
but with filtered blood and for<lb/>
these the Camp was not needed-</p>
<p>I read Dr Angl&eacute;s's letter with<lb/>
interest. He has a number of errors<lb/>
in it- It is absurd that the Rojas<lb/>
Camp was established to test out<lb/>
the Sanarelli organism- That was<lb/>
a laboratory proposition and was<lb/>
completed by Aug. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Camp Lazear<lb/>
was completed on Nov. 20 of that<lb/>
year 1900- It is an error of small<lb/>
importance, but it was not Dr. Kean and<lb/>
his wife who suffered an attack of<lb/>
yellow fever in the house across the<lb/>
Street from No. 20 Gen. Lee Street, but<lb/>
Major and Mrs. Edmunds- I was<lb/>
living &amp; sleeping in the <unclear>Hgo</unclear> building on<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06284089"/>
6<lb/>
the Calzada de Marianao (which we called<lb/>
the Calzada Real) My wife, thank <unclear>Heaven</unclear>,<lb/>
was in New Jersey- I had forgotten<lb/>
that Dr. Angl&eacute;s was on the Yellow<lb/>
Fever Board in Marianao but I<lb/>
see that Reed names him as one of<lb/>
them in his Preliminary Note. Capt 2<lb/>
page 56 of the Y. F. Book-</p>
<p>Would you like for me to write to<lb/>
him and see if I can put him<lb/>
straight about the location of<lb/>
Camp Lazear- It might do some<lb/>
good- A long letter from Gen.<lb/>
Truby came by the same mail<lb/>
delivery with your letter- He said<lb/>
he had been sick, but that he<lb/>
had mailed to you the copy of<lb/>
his article which I had read and<lb/>
made marginal notes about - only<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f06284090"/>
7.<lb/>
they were not on the margins but<lb/>
on the backs of the opposing pages-<lb/>
He said "they should reach you<lb/>
by Monday next- Which would<lb/>
be Oct. 7 as he wrote me Oct. 4-<lb/>
Did you get my air mail letter as to<lb/>
Dr. Cooke- And speaking of the Fomites<lb/>
Volunteers have you ever made any<lb/>
contact with England? I see a long<lb/>
review of his services in the Military<lb/>
Surgeon which has just come. He<lb/>
retires at the age of 64 at the end of this<lb/>
month- He remained all this time in the<lb/>
Army - being an enlisted man until<lb/>
discharged Feb. 15, 1918 in order to accept<lb/>
a commission in the National Army-<lb/>
He has been ever since the World War<lb/>
an officer of the Medical Administrative<lb/>
Corps in which they look after Supplies<lb/>
etc. and have no higher grade than Capt-<lb/>
ain- His address is Captain Thomas M.<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06284091"/>
8<lb/>
England. M. A. C. Governor's Island N. Y. H.<lb/>
He is a quiet, modest man like Moran<lb/>
who makes no pose as a hero-</p>
<p>He and Hildebrand occupied Building<lb/>
No. 1. for the period Jan. 11 to Jan. 31, 1901<lb/>
see page 85 of Y. F. Book-</p>
<p>I think I have covered all the <unclear>moot</unclear><lb/>
points in your letter so with all<lb/>
good wishes</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours</salute>
<signed>J. R. Kean</signed>
1. I should not fail however to thank<lb/>
you for the Sixth Rheumatism Review<lb/>
reprinted from the <unclear>Annuals</unclear> of Internal Med.<lb/>
Also for your very interesting paper<lb/>
on the Advantages of Jaundice in<lb/>
Rheumatic Diseases- I read it<lb/>
with great pleasure-<lb/>
2 The discovery of the entries in the Rojas<lb/>
day book of the payments of rent for<lb/>
Camp Lazear was great- Hurrah for you!<lb/>
