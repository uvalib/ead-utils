<salute>Dear Doctor Russell:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have the honor to report my return to Washington on<lb/>
Wednesday, August 7th., having heard from Mrs. <unclear>Frost</unclear> last Saturday<lb/>
that Dr. Frost would return to Baltimore at <add>or about,</add> this time. I called up<lb/>
Dr. Frost's residence, by long distance, the night of my arrival<lb/>
to announce my return and my instant availability for work in con-<lb/>
nection with the final editing of the History of Yellow Fever. Dr.<lb/>
Frost stated that he was not yet quite ready to resume this work, but<lb/>
that he hoped to do so in the very near future and that he would ad-<lb/>
vise me as soon as he could set a tentative date therefor.</p>
<p>In the interim. I shall <add>(a)</add> once more go over the <del>remaining</del> 3&sol;5<lb/>
of Father's MS, yet to be edited, so as to be properly <hi>saturated</hi> with<lb/>
its technicalities when we return to it: (b) Once more collect from<lb/>
the Library of the Surgeon General of the Army and the Library of Con-<lb/>
gress such books as Dr. Frost will certainly need for his remaining work<lb/>
on the MS--Brinton's Maya Chronicles; Lind: Schotte etc. These are<lb/>
sometimes quite hard to secure and I do not want to lose any time by<lb/>
not having them already &ldquo;lined up.&rdquo; <unclear>(c)</unclear> I shall also go over, and<lb/>
probably add to, my rather extensive Memorandum <hi>re</hi> details in connection<lb/>
with the actual completion of the book about which I wish to 
ask Dr.<lb/>
Frost.</p>
<p>I am glad to say that I was able to do more work on the book<lb/>
while at &ldquo;Dunlora&rdquo; tha<del>n</del><add>t</add> I had anticipated (a) In collaboration, by cor-<lb/>
cespondance<add>,</add> with Mr. Weckerley on the outline maps and (b) having the<lb/>
good fortune to meet Mr. David I. Bushnell of the Smithsonian Institu-<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fc0326053"/>
Institu-<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
tion, who has offered to help me get all my illustrative material in<lb/>
the best shape for reproduction as soon as the size of the book is<lb/>
determined--i. e. octavo, quarto etc. The illustrations in Mr. Bush-<lb/>
nells many publications on the American Indians etc. are particularly<lb/>
good and I feel that with the help of the various men at the Smithso-<lb/>
nian to whom he has promised to introduce me I should be able to turn<lb/>
over this material to you in a very satisfactory form. This, of course,<lb/>
would in no wise delay the time of the completion of the work on the<lb/>
Ms., as I could attend to it over here during the intervals when Dr.<lb/>
Frost does not need me (a) in Baltimore, for explanation of cards or<lb/>
(b) at the Libraries here, in case he wishes more extensive data on<lb/>
some references than I anticipated.</p>
<p>Miss <add>Brown is, of</add> course, ready and eagerly waiting to render<lb/>
us all further assistance in her power on a volunteer basis.</p>
<p>With all manner of good wishes to yourself and most earnest<lb/>
hopes that, on its resumption, the work will go through quickly and<lb/>
without further interruption,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>

P. S. I know that you all share my feelings in regard to poor<lb/>
Mrs. Darling's loss of her oldest son. I have just received a very<lb/>
heart-broken letter from her. Poor woman! She has suffered much--<lb/>
and bravely!<lb/>
<add>Sorry indeed</add> about Dr. Lewis<add>'</add> death from yellow fever and that of<lb/>
the man in Liberia.<lb/>
