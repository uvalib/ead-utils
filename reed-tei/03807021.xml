<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter of February 24, 1941 has been referred to the Reading<lb/>
Rooms for attention and report.</p>
<p>There is no published report of the Military Governor of Cuba for<lb/>
1898. A card for the report for 1902 (Card 4-19629) is attached. This<lb/>
was the last report, as the civil government of Cuba was inaugurated and<lb/>
the American troops withdrawn on May 20, 1902.</p>
<p>The Department of Havana was established December 30, 1898. It be-<lb/>
came the Department of Havana and Pinar del Rio (afterwards Department of<lb/>
Western Cuba), May 1, 1900; and on November 15, 1900 it became the Depart-<lb/>
ment of Cuba. The reports of the Commanding General, Department of Havana,<lb/>
covering December 22, 1898 to May 1, 1900 were made by General William<lb/>
Ludlow. These are covered by card 2-10076 and card 31-1241, which are<lb/>
attached. We have a printed card for a report of General John R. Brooke,<lb/>
commanding the Division of Cuba, 1899. It is also attached (card 1-4181).<lb/>
We do not have any printed cards for any other reports on Cuba which may<lb/>
have been printed separately, except those of the military governors.<lb/>
Printed cards for the reports by military governors of Cuba have either<lb/>
been sent on a previous request or are being enclosed in this present list.</p>
<p>The annual report of the Department of Havana and Pinar del Rio<lb/>
for 1900, published Aug. 23, 1900 at Quemados, Cuba, bears the title:<lb/>
&ldquo;Annual report of Fitzhugh Lee commanding department of Western Cuba&rdquo;.<lb/>
This appears in the annual reports of the War Department for 1900 but with-<lb/>
out the appendixes. [Vol. I, part 3]. The annual reports of the Commanding<lb/>
General of the Department of Cuba for 1900 and 1901 were published separately<lb/>
and then republished in the annual reports of the War Department but the<lb/>
appendixes were omitted. [1900, Vol. I, part 4, 1901, Vol. I, part 3]. The<lb/>
report of the Commanding General for 1902 appears in volume IX of the War<lb/>
Department annual reports.</p>
<p>We have no printed card for the separate annual reports of the War<lb/>
Department. Since these reports are multi-volume sets with many parts we<lb/>
are indicating those parts which contain material pertinent to Cuba. The<lb/>
volumes and parts listed below will include the annual reports of the com-<lb/>
manding generals and will also duplicate some of the material described<lb/>
on the enclosed cards. War Department reports for 1898, vol. I; for 1899,<lb/>
vol. I, parts 2, 3, 6; for 1900, vol. I, parts 2, 3, 4, 11, 12; for 1901,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03807022"/>
- 2 -<lb/>
part 3; for 1902, vol. IX.</p>
<p>We do not have printed cards to cover all official documents pertain-<lb/>
ing to the war of 1898 and the intervention in Cuba, but we are enclosing<lb/>
certain cards which we have available at this time. The &ldquo;Checklist of<lb/>
United States public documents, 1789-1909&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Catalogue of public do-<lb/>
cuments&rdquo; for the years 1898 to 1902 will reveal other documents of varying<lb/>
importance. Copies of these two publications should be available in the<lb/>
library of the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis or at the State Library<lb/>
at St. Paul.</p>
<p>For the Librarian of Congress.</p>
