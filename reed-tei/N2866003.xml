<p>WALTER REED AND YELLOW FEVER. (a)<lb/>
(a) &ldquo;Walter Reed and Yellow Fever.&rdquo; By Howard A. Kelly,<lb/>
Professor of Gynecological Surgery, John Hopkins University.<lb/>
New York: McClure, Phillips and Co. 1906.</p>
<p>DR. HOWARD KELLY has found time in the midst of<lb/>
his strenuous life to carry through a task which should<lb/>
earn him the gratitude of all Anglo-Saxon medical<lb/>
men, namely, the writing of a biography of Walter<lb/>
Reed, army surgeon, bacteriologist, and discoverer of<lb/>
the intermediate host of yellow fever. To British<lb/>
medical men in particular this book will be acceptable,<lb/>
because so hasty is the advance of knowledge and so<lb/>
fleeting are men's recollections of the individuals who<lb/>
have established its landmarks, that the true romances<lb/>
of scientific achievement all too easily escape the atten-<lb/>
tion they deserve. And this history of the work of the<lb/>
Yellow Fever Commission in Cuba is a romance in real<lb/>
life, none the less poignant because it was played out<lb/>
at a distance from the haunts of men and entailed a<lb/>
painful list of casualties among the bright and noble<lb/>
spirits which animated it. There is no devotion so<lb/>
complete, so utter, as that which knowingly and in<lb/>
cold blood offers life and health for the benefit of man-<lb/>
kind, and of such could there be a finer example than<lb/>
was presented by the two young private soldiers who<lb/>
with full knowledge of the almost certain conse-<lb/>
quences, offered themselves as subjects for the bite<lb/>
of infected mosquitoes? Major Reed did them no less<lb/>
than justice when he touched his cap and said, &ldquo;Gentle-<lb/>
men, I salute you.&rdquo; Nor should we forget the calm<lb/>
self sacrifice of Dr. Carroll and Dr. Lazear; the former<lb/>
was the first subject of an experimental mosquito bite,<lb/>
and the latter lost his life in the cause. It is good that<lb/>
all men, and especially all medical men, should learn<lb/>
and cherish in their memories their noble deeds. Dr.<lb/>
Kelly quite clearly establishes Walter Reed's claim to<lb/>
be the first to demonstrate the actual part played by<lb/>
the mosquito in the dissemination of yellow fever,<lb/>
first by his patient destructive criticism of the work of<lb/>
Sanarelli and others, and, secondly, by his construc-<lb/>
tive experiments. The Britisher may feel a little<lb/>
glow of patriotic pride when he reflects that without<lb/>
Ma<del>u</del>se<del>r</del> and Ross there would have been no Reed, but<lb/>
he will never be tempted to withhold his tribute of<lb/>
homage from the discoverer of a verity so pregnant<lb/>
with human happiness as that which Reed established.<lb/>
By no means the least valuable part of the book is that<lb/>
which deals with the previous history of yellow fever<lb/>
and the evolution of the idea of insect-transference,<lb/>
and in it full justice is done to the work of all Reed's<lb/>
predecessors. When, too, alongside it we read of the<lb/>
many definite facts demonstrated by the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Commission, and the immediately satisfactory results<lb/>
that ensued from prophylactic work founded upon the<lb/>
conclusions, we feel that this is a book of substantial<lb/>
and enduring worth. For it we have heartily to thank<lb/>
Dr. Howard Kelly, to whom we doubt not its prepara-<lb/>
tion was a labour of pleasure and a labour of love;<lb/>
but he will none the less be gratified to know that his<lb/>
tribute to the memory of his dead friend will find an<lb/>
echo in the hearts of humble workers in the same<lb/>
field on this side of the Atlantic.</p>
