FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY<lb/>
Dr. Howard A. Kelly,<lb/>
1418 Eutaw Place,<lb/>
Baltimore, Maryland.<lb/>
<salute>My dear Dr. Kelly:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yours dated the 7th but postmarked the 10th has just reached me,<lb/>
and it will give me the greatest pleasure to assist you in any way I<lb/>
can in collecting material for a &ldquo;Life of Walter Reed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stock of material with regard to his personal life is very<lb/>
slender and was pretty well drawn upon by Major McCaw in his charming<lb/>
little sketch which is being circulated by the Reed Memorial Association<lb/>
and which doubtless you have read.</p>
<p>With regard to yellow fever work:- I will send you a collection<lb/>
of all the monographs. If you are going to give a history of the epi-<lb/>
demics of yellow fever in this country, however, you will find a com-<lb/>
plete account of the earlier ones in La Roche's monumental work. If<lb/>
you want any other bibliography of yellow fever, I am sure that McCaw,<lb/>
who is the Librarian of the Surgeon General's Office, will be glad to<lb/>
furnish it to you.</p>
<p>With regard to the personal charm and attractiveness of Dr. Reed,<lb/>
it is hard to furnish &ldquo;data&rdquo;, though I have the liveliest recollection<lb/>
and appreciation of these characteristics of his and attempted to de-<lb/>
scribe them in the short address that I made at the memorial meeting of<lb/>
the Medical Society of the District of Columbia shortly after his death.<lb/>

FROM DR. HOWARD A. KELLY<lb/>
I suppose you have the addresses made at that meeting as far as they<lb/>
were printed. Unfortunately, the <unclear>ost</unclear> striking ones, those of Dr.<lb/>
Welch and General Wood, were extemporaneous and as there was no reporter<lb/>
there, were not obtained.</p>
<p>I will have Dr. Carroll get you together a collection of Reed's<lb/>
monographs and will send you whatever I have whenever you write for it.<lb/>
I will ask you, however, to return me the things I send, as I have no<lb/>
duplicates and want to keep them as memorials of one of the most bril-<lb/>
liant and one of the most delightful friends I have ever had.</p>
<p>On account of Dr. Carroll's intimate association with Dr. Reed<lb/>
in the later years of his life he can perhaps furnish you other material<lb/>
which will be suitable, and will, I am sure, be glad to assist you if<lb/>
you call on him.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very sincerely, your friend,</salute>
<signed>J.R. Kean.<lb/>
Major, Surgeon, U. S. Army</signed>.
