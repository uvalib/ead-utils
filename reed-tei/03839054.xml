<salute>My dear Carlos:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was interested to hear that one of your colleagues, Dr. Douglas<lb/>
Dodge, is a close relative of Dr. Carroll. At your suggestion I am taking<lb/>
the liberty of sending him a reprint of my article and a brief letter. I<lb/>
would appreciate it greatly if you would amplify my letter by telling him<lb/>
that I had a little trouble in trying to see Dr. Carroll's son in Washing-<lb/>
ton. Indeed, I did not see him at all. I don't know why he was suspicious<lb/>
of my motives. I can assure you he had no reason to be. I was simply try-<lb/>
ing to work up the story in detail and to give full credit to everyone.<lb/>
I do not think that historians have given full credit to Dr. Carroll. The<lb/>
only way I can correct this is by having Dr. Carroll's relatives give me<lb/>
as much help as possible and give me access to whatever information they<lb/>
have; otherwise, the matter will remain as it has in the past.</p>
<p>Do you suppose Dr. Dodge could help me by sending Mr. Carroll one<lb/>
of my reprints with the little statement that he was interested indeed to<lb/>
receive it and thought that he would send his nephew one also in case he<lb/>
had not received one? He might also add that he has heard about me through<lb/>
you, that I am a member of the Mayo Clinic staff, etc., much interested in<lb/>
the yellow fever story, that I am anxious to give the whole story, giving<lb/>
credit to all concerned and that it is quite possible that I may be visiting<lb/>
Washington sometime in the near future, in which case it might be a good<lb/>
idea if his ne<del>w</del>phew might be able to meet me, etc. I leave it to you to say<lb/>
the right thing. I can assure you that if they don't wish me to intrude in<lb/>
their personal affairs I will not do so but it seems to me that by avoiding<lb/>
me they are doing exactly what they don't want to do--make it impossible for<lb/>
historians to correct the past records.</p>
