<salute>My dear Pa:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I have not been able,<lb/>
as yet, to visit either the War or<lb/>
Navy Departments, in order to see<lb/>
what I could find out about Penel=<lb/>
ope Reed's pension or John White's<lb/>
service aboard the Constellation-<lb/>
I will do this just as soon as my Class-<lb/>
work will permit me. In the meanwhile,<lb/>
I have had an answer from Uncle Tom<lb/>
White as well as one from Cousin Bettie<lb/>
Reed Holley- First, as to Uncle Tom's an-<lb/>
swer. He says that Stephen White was<lb/>
the son of John White and Sallie--<lb/>
--whose last name he does not recall-<lb/>
his grand-parents both died before his<lb/>
birth- Stephen White married Christiana<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14007002"/>
Hollowell, the daughter of <hi>Nathan</hi><lb/>
Hollowell and his wife, Milly Perry-<lb/>
He remembers well his grandparents on<lb/>
his mother's side- He further says that<lb/>
his father was on the U.S. Frigate, Constel-<lb/>
lation, but does not think that he<lb/>
took part in the war of 1812 -<lb/>
Cousin Bettie writes that she went<lb/>
to her brother's house, which is in the<lb/>
Country, and looked over the records <del>of</del><lb/>
left by her father- Wilson Reed's father<lb/>
was William Reed who was married<lb/>
to Alvi&eacute; Wilson on Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 21, 1790.<lb/>
By this wife, William Reed had two<lb/>
children, Wilson &amp; Rebecca- The<lb/>
daughter Rebecca married James<lb/>
<hi>Sutton</hi> July 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1810- and evidently<lb/>
your name (&ldquo;sutton&rdquo;) comes from<lb/>
this same James Sutton who married<lb/>
your father's first cousin- After his<lb/>
first wife's death, W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Reed married<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f14007003"/>
again, but she did not tell me as to<lb/>
any other children by his second wife or her<lb/>
name either. She further wrote that<lb/>
her father's records show that William<lb/>
Reed was the Son of Tully Reed who<lb/>
was descended from Joseph Reed<lb/>
who married one of the four daughters<lb/>
of George Durant, Jr. the son of<lb/>
George Durant, who settled <add> at about 1660</add> Durant's Neck.<lb/>
The other daughters of George Durant, Jr.<lb/>
married as follows: one married James<lb/>
Blannt, one married Joseph <unclear>Cooprew</unclear>, &amp;<lb/>
one - Williams. The records further<lb/>
show that Joseph Reed was descended<lb/>
from Christopher Reed, whose descendants<lb/>
owned land at Durant's neck as early as<lb/>
1680- She says (She is evidently quoting from<lb/>
the records) that <hi>Christopher Reed's</hi> Tomb<lb/>
is now in a state of preservation at<lb/>
said place - She afterward adds that his<lb/>
grave has been partly washed into the Sound<lb/>
but that the slab has been preserved &amp; is<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14007004"/>
now resting under a gum-tree near<lb/>
the Sound - I understood you to say that<lb/>
<hi>Christian Reed's</hi> grave was the one from<lb/>
which the gentleman took the slab to make<lb/>
of it a door-step- It seems that it was really<lb/>
<hi>Christopher Reed's</hi> &amp; not <hi>Christian's</hi>- She<lb/>
says that the records further state that<lb/>
Christopher Reed was the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Christian</hi><lb/>
Reed who came to this Country in 1640, and<lb/>
<add>that Christopher</add> was one of the <del>proprietors</del> Councillors of Lord Proprie-<lb/>
tors and the first Reed of any prominence in<lb/>
this Country. Christian Reed returned to<lb/>
England, but left his Son, Christopher at<lb/>
Durant's neck where he died &amp; was buried.<lb/>
Now what do you think of this? I think that it is<lb/>
extremely interesting - William Reed, Wilson Reed's<lb/>
father was of course the brother of the father of<lb/>
Thomas Walk Reed - Do you not think that<lb/>
very likely <del>that</del> the W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Reed &amp; James V. Reed,<lb/>
of whom you spoke to me, were Sons of<lb/>
this Same William Reed <add>by his second marriage</add>? Or are you certain<lb/>
that William Reed &amp; James V. were half brothers<lb/>
(I have it thus written down) and Cousins of<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14007005"/>
of Wilson Reed &amp; Thomas Walk<lb/>
Reed? If the letter is true, then<lb/>
William &amp; James V. are the sons of<lb/>
the other brother (the 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> of whom you<lb/>
spoke) who lived in Beatie Co-<lb/>
If so, I shouldn't be surprised<lb/>
if this same brother named one<lb/>
child &ldquo;William&rdquo;, after his brother<lb/>
William (Wilson Reed's father) &amp; the<lb/>
other James V- after his other brother,<lb/>
(the father of Thomas Walk Reed)- If so<lb/>
Thomas Walk<del>'s</del> Reed's father was<lb/>
named James Reed - of course,<lb/>
this is only probable, but it is<lb/>
worth considering after all. Don't<lb/>
you think so? At any rate, if I<lb/>
can find <del>whe</del> that Penelope<lb/>
Wright was a pensioner, I will<lb/>
clear up this very point-<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14007006"/>
I have, again, written to Cousin<lb/>
Bettie, asking her to ascertain whether<lb/>
she can find the names of her<lb/>
grandfather, William Reed's brothers-<lb/>
but have not had time for an answer.<lb/>
The Union between the Reeds &amp; Durants<lb/>
in the Early parts of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century is, to me,<lb/>
exceedingly interesting- I intend to go<lb/>
down, next May, &amp; look into the subject much<lb/>
more carefully, for I have always thought that<lb/>
my ancestors were people of worth and<lb/>
honesty. But enough of this - we trust<lb/>
that you and yours are very well-<lb/>
my! how it rains &amp; snows! the day<lb/>
is abominable- All join me in<lb/>
much love <add>to all</add>- write when you<lb/>
can-</p>
