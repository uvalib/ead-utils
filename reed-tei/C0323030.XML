<salute>Dear Doctor Stephens:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It seems far more than four years ago when my Father, the<lb/>
late Assistant Surgeon General Henry Rose Carter, and myself had<lb/>
the pleasure of meeting you at the International Health Conference<lb/>
at Kingston, <unclear>Jamaica</unclear>.</p>
<p>Father's last illness began just three days after he had<lb/>
completed that Section of his projected History of Yellow Fever<lb/>
dealing with the probable place of origin of the disease. This,<lb/>
as he probably told you, he believed was the West Coast of Africa.<lb/>
Preceeding the Section mentioned above were two other Sections, of<lb/>
which that on Epidemiology was carried up to, and inclusive of,<lb/>
July 1925.</p>
<p>It is in regard to the bibliography of the Section on Epidemio-<lb/>
logy that I am writing you now: To ask if you will be so very kind<lb/>
as to give me any data you may have as to the enclosed references.<lb/>
Those <hi>re</hi> (1) <hi>A&euml;des (Stegomyia) aegypti</hi> breeding in crab holes at<lb/>
Grand Bassam (1922)? and in (2) in mud holes and tracks of children<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="fC0323031"/>
children<lb/>
-2-<lb/>
around the lagoon at Salt Pond (1923) are from unpublished re-<lb/>
ports, while the fact that the matter was under <add>further</add> investigation is<lb/>
mentioned, on page 8, as having been stated in a personal communi-<lb/>
cation by yourself<del>.</del> <add>1924).</add> I feel quite sure, however, that these obser-<lb/>
vations must have been subsequently published, probably by yourself,<lb/>
and shall be greatly indebted to you if you could tell me where to<lb/>
find them. Naturally, I have already made as thorough a search as<lb/>
was possible of the periodicals and books in the Library of the Sur-<lb/>
geon General of the Army, especially those published in Great Britain,<lb/>
before troubling you. The book will soon be ready to go to press,<lb/>
however, and I <hi>do</hi> want those references for the bibliography, on which<lb/>
I have been working &ldquo;against time&rdquo; for the past year. I know you<lb/>
will be interested to hear that the final editing of the book is be-<lb/>
ing done by Dr. Wade Hampton Frost of the Johns Hopkins School of<lb/>
Hygiene and Public Health, whom Father not only loved personally, but<lb/>
considered <unclear><del>our</del><add>the</add></unclear> foremost <add>American</add> epidemiologist. Indeed, it was a great com-<lb/>
fort to Father in his last illness to know that Dr. Frost would do<lb/>
this work in his stead.</p>
<p>With highest esteem, and trusting some day to have the prive-<lb/>
ledge of <unclear>again</unclear> seeing you, I remain</p>
<closer>
<salute>Most truly yours,</salute>
<signed>Dr. J. W. W. Stevens, F. R. S.,</signed>
