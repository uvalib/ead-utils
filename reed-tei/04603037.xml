<p>Hench informs Lippard that Crain was the representative of the University of Virginia at the Camp Lazear dedication. He requests that he send the enclosed information about the ceremony to someone at the University of Virginia since Lippard has just become dean at the Yale Medical School. He requests reimbursement for the wreath.</p>

Dr. Vernon W. Lippard, Dean<lb/>
Yale Medical School<lb/>
Yale University<lb/>
New Haven, Connecticut<lb/>
<salute>My dear Doctor Lippard:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I saw in the NEW YORK TIMES last Sunday your photograph and a little article<lb/>
about your arrival at Yale Medical School. I feel, with your Virginia friends,<lb/>
that the University of Virginia has indeed lost an excellent dean to Yale's<lb/>
gain. I wish you a most happy time at Yale.</p>
<p>I am sending to you at New Haven the enclosed memorandum on the dedication<lb/>
of Camp Lazear which actually comprises a long personal letter written primarily<lb/>
for the relatives of those who were honored but if you have any time to read<lb/>
it I think you will find something of interest and perhaps amusement in it<lb/>
as it mentions certain political and diplomatic sidelights.</p>
<p>I had intended to give myself the honor of placing the wreath as the repre-<lb/>
sentative of the University of Virginia but, as you will read, last minute<lb/>
substitutions had to be made and I had to lay two wreaths before that from<lb/>
the University of Virginia was placed. Therefore the excellent representative<lb/>
of the University of Virginia was Mr. Earl T. Crain, First Secretary of the<lb/>
U. S. Embassy. I am sure that he would be very pleased if you had time to<lb/>
write him just a very short note thanking him for rendering this service for<lb/>
the University of Virginia. Indeed he was in many ways a better representa-<lb/>
tive than I as he had diplomatic status. A photograph of him placing the<lb/>
wreath was taken by the news photographers. I have a copy and expect to re-<lb/>
ceive the film on loan soon. I can either send you a small copy for a few<lb/>
cents or a regular size enlargement could be made by a local photographer for,<lb/>
I suppose, the usual price of about a dollar or so, if you think the Uni-<lb/>
versity of Virginia Alumni Bulletin might wish to publish it.</p>
<p>I assume that you will send the enclosed to one of your friends at the<lb/>
University of Virginia Medical School in case they wish to see it and<lb/>
perhaps they may want to <unclear>fill-</unclear> this data on Reed in the files of the Medical<lb/>
School or hand it over to the &ldquo;Reed file&rdquo; being collected at the University<lb/>
of Virginia Library.</p>
<p>The cost of each wreath was $15. They were really very lovely and would have<lb/>
cost two or three times that much here. They were purchased from &ldquo;Milagros<lb/>
Flores&rdquo;, Lucila Schumann, President, who gave me only one bill itemizing<lb/>
each wreath and institutional donor. If you need an ozalid copy I can send<lb/>
it. Otherwise I should be glad to receive a check for $15 at your convenience.</p>
