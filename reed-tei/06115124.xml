<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Thank you so much for Blossom's ms. You were very nice to let<lb/>
me have a look at it, and I can appreciatie your uneasiness.<lb/>
You are rather in the position of the fomites fellows - nothing<lb/>
bad was going to happen to them, but they couldn't be sure of<lb/>
that until it was all over.</p>
<p>There were two or three things I should have liked to use, but<lb/>
not very urgently. I thought one thing<del><unclear>s</unclear></del> was very sweet - how<lb/>
shocked he was on the boat when the young man scolded his wife<lb/>
because her hat blew off. He was so horrified that the loss of<lb/>
a bonnet should be the occasion of harsh words and revolved that<lb/>
nothing of the sort would ever happen with him &amp; Emilie. As<lb/>
you say, a lot of the letters are just too too. Obscurity has<lb/>
compensations - people don't collect the letters that you wrote<lb/>
when you were in your twenties. I'm sure Blossom will never<lb/>
sell them in that form, and it will be so much the better for<lb/>
Reed's memory if she doesn't.</p>
<p>As you know, I have that little jingle about the mosquito that<lb/>
she quotes, but I got it from Gen. Kean's diary.</p>
<p>It amused me a great deal to see how, in the midst of being so<lb/>
conscientiously high-flown and literary, Reed could suddenly say<lb/>
something normal and <del>and</del> nice and funny - like in the long let-<lb/>
ter about how he was sick in NY that was so filled with vague<lb/>
lamentations and stuff he told about clashing with his landlady<lb/>
and mentioned that she now knew what he thought about homeopathy,<lb/>
spiritualism, abolitionism etc., and that he had a new address.</p>
<p>Did you see that Mr. Andrus died a week or two ago?</p>
<p>I'm supposed to finish - finally - this week and get the revised<lb/>
ms to the publisher. It is bad enough to have to write a book,<lb/>
without having to type the darned thing too. <unclear>Crosy</unclear> has turned<lb/>
out to be a very good editor, which is very helpful to one as<lb/>
addle-headed as I. <unclear>I'd</unclear> like to send you a carbon and if you<lb/>
have time perhaps you will zip through it again to see if there<lb/>
is anything glaring. The facts won't be changed, just the emph-<lb/>
asis here and there in the last part, so if you haven't time to<lb/>
look at it, don't feel that you should.</p>
<p>I'll mail you back the letters today or tomorrow, and I'm really<lb/>
delighted to have seen them at last. Do you suppose I can refer<lb/>
to them, list them I mean, in the bibliography? I should imagine<lb/>
not, under the circumstances.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely,</salute>
