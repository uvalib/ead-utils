<salute>My dear Bill:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I think it would be very nice indeed if you would suggest to your<lb/>
colleagues at the University of Virginia that there be this year<lb/>
some appropriate ceremonies in honor of Walter Reed.</p>
<p>I have forgotten the year of his birth but I do know that last year<lb/>
was the 50th year of his beginning the work on yellow fever in Cuba.<lb/>
They actually finished their work in 1901 rather than 1900 so that<lb/>
this year is the 50th anniversary of the end of their work and next<lb/>
year is the 50th anniversary of Reed's death.</p>
<p>I have given a lecture on Walter Reed at the University of Virginia.<lb/>
I think it would be wiser for you, an alumnus, to suggest this<lb/>
rather than me, an outsider, to do so but I should be delighted to<lb/>
help in any way possible and you have my permission in your cor-<lb/>
respondence to say at the appropriate time something like this: &ldquo;I<lb/>
am sure that Doctor Hench, a student of the life of Walter Reed,<lb/>
would be glad to help in any way possible.&rdquo; The Librarian at the<lb/>
University of Virginia is especially a Reed fan.</p>
<p>It might actually tie in with the plans of the University to do<lb/>
this because when I was there three or four years ago they were<lb/>
hoping to tie in the name of Walter Reed with some of their memorial<lb/>
building projects. I expect to visit my brother at the University<lb/>
of Virginia about February 11.</p>
<p>I tried last year to stimulate some writers to write articles in<lb/>
the popular press calling attention to the 50th anniversary of the<lb/>
conquest of yellow fever. I asked Steven Spencer of the SATURDAY<lb/>
EVENING POST, but the POST had done a story on Moran and Reed just<lb/>
a few years ago and decided not to repeat the story. I tried to<lb/>
interest two or three others and sent them some background material<lb/>
but the only thing that came of it was that Mr. Frank Carey of the<lb/>
Associated Press did write a story which was syndicated in a great<lb/>
many Sunday papers. Of course in these momentous times of tension<lb/>
very little of the world is interested in looking back and con-<lb/>
sidering historical matters. There is too much history in the<lb/>
making today.</p>

<p>January 19, 1951</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think your suggestion is an excellent one and I<lb/>
do hope that you will follow it through.</p>
<p>I am now Vice-President of the Board of Managers of the Walter Reed<lb/>
Memorial Association. We meet once a year in Washington in November<lb/>
and last year we did erect a memorial plaque in the Hospital in<lb/>
Washington where Reed died.</p>
<p>I am sure that General Reed, the son who lives in Washington, and<lb/>
the family would participate in the event because they are very<lb/>
fond of the University of Virginia.</p>
