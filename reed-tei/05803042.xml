<p>Rodriguez Leon would like her father's papers returned to her because she has promised them for a permanent exhibit. She believes that the data shows her father, Agramonte, was in Havana at the time of Lazear's death.</p>

Dr. Philip S. Hench,<lb/>
102-110 Second Ave. S.W.<lb/>
Rochester, Minnesota.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Dr. Hench:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was sorry to hear through Mr. Moran that you had been<lb/>
ill. That explains why I received no answer to my brief<lb/>
note of congratulation, at the time of the write-up in<lb/>
<hi>Time</hi>, concerning your valuable research on rheumatism.<lb/>
I trust you are well now, and that you will allow your_<lb/>
self some rest in the future. Active and enthusiastic<lb/>
workers like you are apt to burn their candles at both<lb/>
ends, and that certainly brings no good results.</p>
<p>I am writing you under considerable pressure, the Summer<lb/>
Session of the University being in full swing, and I am<lb/>
also working with the Educational Department on the reor_<lb/>
ganization of the teaching of English from the bottom up.<lb/>
We Cubans either work at a cyclone rate or nothing is ac_<lb/>
complished.</p>
<p>In the course of this work I have had the opportunity<lb/>
to contact some influential people in the present gov_<lb/>
ernment, and there is a move to do something towards<lb/>
a monument of the work of the Yellow Fever investiga_<lb/>
tors. This will include Finlay of course, but due credit<lb/>
will be given the U.S. Army Board. I'm rather skepti_<lb/>
cal about the ultimate achievement of the committee -<lb/>
a library for research in tropical medicine -, but<lb/>
I feel it is my duty to cooperate in all I can. They<lb/>
are planning with the American Embassy to have a perm_<lb/>
anenet display of all available documents, during the<lb/>
several weeks of a lecture course by famous foreign<lb/>
and native doctors, <hi>beginning next September.</hi> I have<lb/>
promised to provide my father's papers, and now it is<lb/>
up to you to make it possible for me to keep my promise.</p>
<p>Since May 1948, when I decided against hav<del><unclear>e</unclear></del>ing Dr Nogueira<lb/>
bring them back, and when my letter suggesting a contact<lb/>
with a friend of mine in New York who was coming to visit<lb/>
me, <add>missed you</add> during you trip to that <add>very</add> city in May <unclear>1949</unclear> <del>missed you,</del><lb/>
I have been trying to find someone who might happen to<lb/>
pass near your part of the country. I also hoped you<lb/>
might come our way again. Two years have gone by, wishing<lb/>
to avoid the expense of sending all those things by <hi>reg_<lb/>
istered</hi> <del>mail</del> <hi>airmail,</hi> yet anxiously hoping to get my fa_<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f05803043"/>
<hi>Dr. Philip S. Hench (2)</hi><lb/>
ther documents back. I am seriously worried that they<lb/>
might be lost in transit. We have the photostats of<lb/>
course, but my proofs <hi>must be the originals</hi>, to be <unclear>con_</unclear><lb/>
vincing when the time comes to make important announce_<lb/>
ments. I see no other way <del>of</del> for you to return them to<lb/>
me, and I am now anxious to have them at hand during the<lb/>
debate that is sure to arise from the course.</p>
<p>Will you see that they are sent to me <hi>right away</hi>? I see<lb/>
no chance of going up for them myself, or of your bring_<lb/>
ing them to me, and I want to have all my fathers papers<lb/>
classified, mounted and in use by Sept 11th. I am enclos_<lb/>
ing a <xref id="f05803044">list</xref> of the documents you borrowed from me, in case<lb/>
your secretary wishes to use it for reference.</p>
<p>I think I should pay all, or a part at least, of the mail_<lb/>
ing expenses. Please let me know what they are. I am<lb/>
sorry to rush you after so many months, but my urgency<lb/>
responds to the possibility of getting something done<lb/>
at last, by the Cuban government.</p>
<p>Knowing you are sincerely interested in the subject, I<lb/>
shall keep you posted on all future developments.</p>
<p>Please notify me as to the date of mailing, that I may<lb/>
start worrying in earnest. Take care of yourself. Our<lb/>
best regards to your charming wife,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Cordially,</salute>

<seg>
P.S. By the way, were you ever able to complete the record<lb/>
with regard to my fathers absence from Havana in 1900?<lb/>
Some additional data seems to re-establish the fact of<lb/>
his presence in Havana at the time of Lazear's death,<lb/>
in spite of that trip to U.S. I wish I could see Major<lb/>
Reed's personal correspondence of the time. There seems<lb/>
to have been a letter from my father, and what is more<lb/>
valuable, <hi>a note from convalescent Carroll - afterwards<lb/>
<unclear>antagonistic</unclear> to Agramonte</hi> - describing the details of La_<lb/>
zear's death. Do you think Gen. W. Reed would have those<lb/>
papers, now that his mother died?<lb/>
<unclear>you rep</unclear><lb/>
<hi>Please</hi> let me hear from you as soon as possible., about<lb/>
returning the documents. Thank you!<lb/>
