<salute>My dear Colonel Phalen:</salute>
</opener>
<p>At the luncheon on Dec. 15 someone in authority, I<lb/>
am uncertain whether it was you or Hume, asked me if I had a<lb/>
copy of the remarks which I was going to make. I said <hi>no</hi>, only<lb/>
some notes which were not full enough for publication. You<lb/>
remember that, after the two Surgeon Gener<del>l</del><add>a</add>ls McIntyre and<lb/>
Parran had made their speeches, they got restless <del>n</del><add>a</add>nd wanted to<lb/>
go back to their offices, and Captain Mann thought it best to<lb/>
suggest that Gen. Russell and I had better simply express our<lb/>
thanks, so that the proceeding could be brought to an end.<lb/>
Making speeches is not my long suit anyway, so it was all right<lb/>
with me, and I imagine Russell felt the same way and so it was<lb/>
done.</p>
<p>But Hume wrote to me afterwards and asked me to write<lb/>
out for him from my notes what was in my mind to say and I did<lb/>
so and sent them to him, I suppose for some writing which he had<lb/>
in hand. He has now returned to me a fair copy of it, and it has<lb/>
occurred to me that you might wish to have a copy for the records<lb/>
of your office, or at any rate might wish to see it - so here it<lb/>
is. Please return it after reading it and, if you wish to keep<lb/>
a copy, you might send me an extra carbon. The only value of it<lb/>
is to make it clear that the citation does not trespass at all on<lb/>
Gorgas's domain. I do not think that Gorgas's delay in accepting<lb/>
Reed's findings should be made a matter of criticism of him, and<lb/>
(as I say) that Gorgas lost nothing in fame or in opportunity<lb/>
(for advancement) by it. As the citation is signed both by<lb/>
Captain Mann and by you, it might come in well if any one chose<lb/>
to be critical.</p>
<p>Gorgas's Final Report which is referred to by me may<lb/>
be found in the collection of documents relating to the Walter<lb/>
Reed and Yellow Fever Episode which, under instructions from<lb/>
the Surgeon General, I collected and had published as Senate<lb/>
Document No. 822 of the 61st Congress, 2nd Session. It is long<lb/>
out of print. I think that Gen. Russell got the last copy. No.<lb/>
Dr. P. S. Hench of the Mayo Foundation dug up positively the<lb/>
last one at the Capitol 2 years ago.</p>
<p>With all good wishes and much appreciation for what<lb/>
you and your office have been always willing to do to oblige<lb/>
me, I am,</p>
<closer>
<salute>Always your friend Sincerely,</salute>
<signed>(Signed) J. R. KEAN</signed>
