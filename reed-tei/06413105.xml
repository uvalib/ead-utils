<salute>Dear Col Hench-</salute>
</opener>
<p>Mrs Truby and <unclear>I</unclear> had a<lb/>
wonderful 2 1/2 months stay in<lb/>
the East-Maryland, Washington, Phila.<lb/>
and Western New York state- We both<lb/>
enjoyed it immensely and it made me<lb/>
do unusual stunts much to my benefit.</p>
<p>Everything went as planned except my<lb/>
visit with you much to my regret.</p>
<p>However I accomplished one thing I<lb/>
wanted to do with you found the room<lb/>
<del>that</del><add>where</add> Walter Reed died. I took Lawrence<lb/>
Reed with me and he has all the <unclear>hope-</unclear></p>
<p>At first I was quite bewildered, for the<lb/>
up stairs corridors were not as I had<lb/>
pictured them but after walking through<lb/>
the the various rooms I found one which<lb/>
had the door &amp; window in the right place<lb/>
but seemed too small. Upon careful inspection<lb/>
we found that a temporary partition had been<lb/>
put in which made the room smaller. Then<lb/>
I was sure we had the right room. Gen. R.<lb/>
has all the necessary info. for you and<lb/>
will show you the room when you go<lb/>
to Washington.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06413106"/>
<p>I will inclose the pictures which Maj. Gilhus<lb/>
showed me two days before he died. They<lb/>
probably can't be reproduced but they will<lb/>
be most instructive to you in several ways.<lb/>
I have <unclear>attalched</unclear> notes but the remarks in<lb/>
pencil <del><unclear>are</unclear></del> were all made by Gilhus. The<xref id="f06413107"> sketch</xref> <lb/>
was a surprise to me as I had not seen<lb/>
that until I went to see Mrs Gilhus a week<lb/>
or so ago. With it <add><unclear>it</unclear></add> seems easy to figure out<lb/>
how the &ldquo;Surgery&rdquo; &amp; other shacks were move as<lb/>
I have tried to indicate on the back of<lb/>
G's sketch. I am sure you will be pleased<lb/>
with the pictures eventhough they are badly <unclear>faded-</unclear></p>
<p>I had a grand visit with old friends in<lb/>
Washington. Kean, Ireland, Lawrence Reed &amp; Siler were<lb/>
all fine but distinctly older than when I was<lb/>
there in '42. I had that drink with dear old<lb/>
Ranny Kean and we had two nice visits together<lb/>
but no time to talk of y f.</p>
<p>I hope you got that little building in Cuba<lb/>
taken care of. Probably you have been down<lb/>
there. Hope you got my letter at <unclear>Allantic</unclear> City (<unclear>Ame</unclear>)<lb/>
suggesting that you see D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <unclear>Strade</unclear>. I am sure<lb/>
he would help-</p>
<p>Write when you find time.</p>
