<p>Fitzhugh Lee Sees the Light at Last.</p>
<p>We are glad to find our old and esteem-<lb/>
ed friend, Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, at last<lb/>
aligned with us on the yellow fever is-<lb/>
sue. Up to this time, or until a very re-<lb/>
cent date, the general has been rather<lb/>
disposed to accept the proposition that<lb/>
yellow fever can be suppressed by the<lb/>
simple agencies of the shovel, the broom,<lb/>
and a certain fluency in the matter of<lb/>
carbolic acid.</p>
<p>This hypothesis was set up simulta-<lb/>
neously with our beneficent occupation of<lb/>
Cuba. It had the sanction of Gen. Leon-<lb/>
ard Wood, previously an assistant sur-<lb/>
geon in the army, and a physician of<lb/>
acknowledged merit. It had the sanction<lb/>
of Gen. William Ludlow, one of our most<lb/>
accomplished engineer officers and an ex-<lb/>
pert in general sanitation. It had the<lb/>
approval--at least presumably--of Gov.<lb/>
Gen. Brooke, which naturally meant<lb/>
much. Hundreds of thousands of dollars<lb/>
were expended on feather dusters, sanita-<lb/>
tive fluids, and syringes of great power<lb/>
wherewith to disseminate them--to say<lb/>
nothing of picks, spades, and carts, per-<lb/>
haps, &amp;c. The summer of 1899 developed<lb/>
very little yellow fever. Cuba has its ec-<lb/>
centricities. Then arose the concerted<lb/>
jubilations of the wiseacres. American<lb/>
talent, American genius, American liber-<lb/>
ality of expenditure had scotched the<lb/>
grisly bugaboo. Gen. Wood announced in<lb/>
Boston that yellow fever was extinct be-<lb/>
cause he had, with his little broom and<lb/>
bucket, eliminated the material upon<lb/>
which its direful activity depended. We<lb/>
were told from Havana, on high author-<lb/>
ity and with equal complacency, the self-<lb/>
same thing. And now, as it appears, yel-<lb/>
low fever has ravaged Havana all sum-<lb/>
mer long, until there is not a block in all<lb/>
the city which has not entertained the<lb/>
dreadful visitor. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee is<lb/>
somewhat late in making his discovery,<lb/>
but he is right at last, and we congratu-<lb/>
late him.</p>
<p>The Post has never throughout this yel-<lb/>
low fever controversy had any purpose<lb/>
save that of discouraging the idiotic the-<lb/>
ories upon which so many false hopes of<lb/>
security were founded. We knew, as the<lb/>
result of experience and observation cov-<lb/>
ering more than a quarter of a century,<lb/>
that neither chemicals nor street sweep-<lb/>
ers could control the coming and the going<lb/>
of yellow fever, any more than could the<lb/>
prayers of preachers or the incantations<lb/>
of magicians or the rumblings of pagan<lb/>
oracles. No one knows the cause of yel-<lb/>
low fever; no one, therefore, can formu-<lb/>
late its preventive. What we seek; what<lb/>
we desire above all things in this connec-<lb/>
tion, is to dispel the foolish superstitions,<lb/>
the ignorant terrors, and the demoraliz-<lb/>
ing theories that have been employed to<lb/>
invest yellow fever with mystery and<lb/>
gloom. It is a disease that comes and<lb/>
goes in the districts in which it makes<lb/>
its habitat. It is not half as dangerous<lb/>
as typhoid; it is not one-tenth as loath-<lb/>
some as smallpox; it is a mere gayety<lb/>
compared with tuberculosis. Its chief and<lb/>
only menace resides in the fact that at<lb/>
times it is epidemic and attacks hundreds<lb/>
on the same day, and, under certain con-<lb/>
ditions, spreads like wildfire. But it is<lb/>
easily treated; its danger to the individual<lb/>
is very slight, and our officials, instead of<lb/>
proclaiming it as a deadly visitation, and,<lb/>
alternately, announcing the discovery of a<lb/>
prophylactic, should accept the views of<lb/>
those who know all that there is to be<lb/>
known about it, and stop their pestiferous<lb/>
and too expensive nonsense.</p>
