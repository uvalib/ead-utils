<salute>My dear Dr. Hench</salute>
</opener>
<p>Col. Harold W. Jones M. C. the Librarian<lb/>
of the Army Medical Library has sent me a<lb/>
copy of the reply that he sent you to your letter<lb/>
to him with your letter. He was a very able surgeon.<lb/>
I think probably the best in the Medical Corps &amp;<lb/>
was the Chief Surgeon at Hawaii, when some<lb/>
years ago the Surgeon General brought him here<lb/>
to be the Head of this great Library. Great Surgeons<lb/>
are, like Horace described parts to be, an <hi>irritable<lb/>
genus</hi> and Col. Jones is not an exception, as I<lb/>
think you can see from his letter. I would not<lb/>
waste any time on him if I were you. I inclose<lb/>
a copy of my reply to him, which Mrs. Kean has<lb/>
been kind enough to copy for me. In the very<lb/>
brief note which I sent you while I was in<lb/>
the hospital, I do not think I congratulated you<lb/>
on your find - the file of letters from Dr. Lazear to his<lb/>
mother covering the time he spent in Cuba.<lb/>
This is I should think a discovery of the first order,<lb/>
which will aid you immensely in your study<lb/>
of his character. You have already come. I think,<lb/>
to the conclusion that Lazear is entitled to stand<lb/>
with Reed on a plane above Carroll &amp; Agramonte<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06310041"/>
AC<lb/>
K<lb/>
2<lb/>
and you will, I hope, have the material in hand<lb/>
to make this clear to all the readers of your book.<lb/>
I have a letter from Andrus saying that he<lb/>
has determined not to try to find a publisher<lb/>
for his Tale of a Guinea Pig until the war is<lb/>
over. I think this is wise. It is surprising how,<lb/>
while a war is on, people lose all interest in other<lb/>
matters and even the best book has no chance<lb/>
at all. Then a couple of years after the war<lb/>
they will not look at a war book and the pendu-<lb/>
lum swings back to normal. I hope that you<lb/>
will continue your researches and be in no hurry<lb/>
to finish your book until the gaps are looked &amp;<lb/>
the clouds of war roll by.</p>
<p>I feel much better, but my bladder is still<lb/>
irritable and I have a feeling that I am not<lb/>
well, altho. the very capable G. U. man at Walter Reed<lb/>
tells me, to my great contentment of mind, that I have<lb/>
no stone in the bladder nor a seriously enlarged<lb/>
prostate, nor any residual urine. I go into these<lb/>
details because you have showed so many<lb/>
evidences of kindly and friendly interest in me</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very sincerely</salute>
<signed>J. R. Kean</signed>
<seg>
P.S. You will find nothing in my letter to Jones which<lb/>
you do not know already, but he is evidently badly<lb/>
in need of orientation.<lb/>
