<salute>Dear General Truby:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was talking with Dr. F. F. Russell while<lb/>
he was in New York during the holidays and he suggested you<lb/>
might be able to answer a question I asked him regarding the<lb/>
experiment of the Reed Commission on a <hi>Macacus rhesus</hi> monkey.</p>
<p>In 1912 Dr. Agramonte published a brief note<lb/>
in the NEW YORK MEDICAL JOURNAL saying that in 1901 a monkey of<lb/>
the above species named Jenny was inoculated three successive<lb/>
times through the bites of infected mosquitoes but remained re-<lb/>
sistant. In our files we have a letter from Dr. Agramonte<lb/>
written shortly before he died, in which he mentioned the fact<lb/>
that the animal was probably immune. The presumption is that<lb/>
the monkey was obtained locally and I wonder if you have any in-<lb/>
formation regarding the source of the animal and the probability<lb/>
of its having been immunized in Havana by naturally acquired in-<lb/>
fection. This matter has interested me as showing how very near<lb/>
the Army Board came to discovering a satisfactory experimental<lb/>
animal and advancing the progress of yellow fever research by<lb/>
another quarter century.</p>
<p>There is another question which I would like to<lb/>
ask some one who was in Cuba at the time of the Army Board's ex-<lb/>
periments. In the play, &ldquo;Yellowjack&rdquo; there were some inaccuracies<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f03343002"/>
-2-<lb/>
regarding the work of our commission in Africa and I presume the<lb/>
same would be true regarding the work of the Army Board. Most<lb/>
of them did no harm, but there was a very strong inference that<lb/>
the soldier Dean was tricked into exposure to mosquitoes and had<lb/>
no idea that there was any danger involved. I have been asked by<lb/>
a number of persons who have seen the play whether this was true<lb/>
and have stated I assumed that it was not, but had no first-hand<lb/>
evidence and had seen no discussion of the point in any of the<lb/>
publications.</p>
<p>If you can give me information regarding the above I<lb/>
shall appreciate it greatly.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
