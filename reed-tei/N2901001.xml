<p>THE L</p>
<p>A CUBAN AMERICAN PAPER <unclear>W</unclear></p>
<p>__________________________________________________</p>
<p>A. San Miguel: Editor.</p>
<p>Havana, Monday,</p>
<p>__________________________________________________</p>
<p>QUESTIONS OF THE DAY.</p>
<p>---- star* star* star* ----</p>
<p>The chief of the health depart-<lb/>
ment of Cuba, Major Jefferson R.<lb/>
Kean, is now at Cienfuegos, making<lb/>
a personal investigation of the san-<lb/>
itary conditions in that city. It is<lb/>
most likely that while there some<lb/>
radical changes may be initiated for<lb/>
the improvement of the public health<lb/>
at that place, as it is admitted that<lb/>
some safeguards should be taken.</p>
<p>The fact that Capt. Thomason ac-<lb/>
companies Major Kean on his trip<lb/>
argues well for the future welfare of<lb/>
that community and particularly for<lb/>
the American troops quartered there,<lb/>
because Dr. Thomason is a man of<lb/>
recognized ability and is thoroughly<lb/>
up-to-date, and what is better is en-<lb/>
ergetic. The work that he will do<lb/>
there will be well and quickly done<lb/>
and his very presence should be an<lb/>
assurance to the community.</p>
<p>The condition in which Cienfue-<lb/>
gos finds itself is mainly, if not sole-<lb/>
ly due to little less than criminal<lb/>
carelessness on the part of the mu-<lb/>
nicipal sanitary authorities, who<lb/>
permitted the situation to become<lb/>
so grave, either of pure negligence,<lb/>
or timidity, to reveal the situation<lb/>
and their own shortcomings, for it<lb/>
could scarcely be charged up to ma-<lb/>
liciousness. If negligence in the<lb/>
first place, or timidity, there is little<lb/>
comfort in either for the chief of<lb/>
the sanitary corps of Cienfuegos,<lb/>
either case should be sufficient cause<lb/>
for immediate dismissal, if such a<lb/>
step can be taken.</p>
<p>While about it for that matter the<lb/>
nationalization of the Health De-<lb/>
partment of Cuba should be effected<lb/>
without a day's delay, for it is im-<lb/>
peratively necessary for the promo-<lb/>
tion of the country's most vital in-<lb/>
terests. The longer it is delayed<lb/>
the greater will be the difficulty and<lb/>
danger. There can be no occasion<lb/>
for not taking this all important<lb/>
step right now, while the result of<lb/>
not having already done so is plain.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the Pro-<lb/>
visional Governor will be firm in this<lb/>
matter and do that which will do the<lb/>
people generally the most good, not<lb/>
heeding the objections interposed<lb/>
by a few politicians who may not<lb/>
wish to see a few of their wards<lb/>
thrown out of <unclear>the</unclear> positions they<lb/>
now hold on the municipal <unclear>pay roles.</unclear><lb/>
As compared to <unclear>the</unclear> good of the<lb/>
country they are nothing and should<lb/>
be given just so much <unclear>consideration</unclear>.</p>
<p>It is noticed that the papers in<lb/>
the States are widely commenting<lb/>
on the re-appearance of yellow <unclear>fever</unclear><lb/>
in Cuba and what is <unclear>said</unclear> about it is<lb/>
far from <unclear>praise</unclear>, and being so widely<lb/>
disseminated works a serious in-<lb/>
jury to the island. <unclear>If</unclear> the people<lb/>
in the States were educated on the<lb/>
subject of yellow fever they <unclear>would</unclear><lb/>
not <unclear>regard</unclear> it with such <unclear>horror</unclear><lb/>
which is unfortunate for them <unclear>as</unclear><lb/>
well as <unclear>to Cuba.</unclear></p>
<p>The American authorities now<lb/>
have a splendid opportunity to do<lb/>
a double service--educate the people<lb/>
at home relative to this disease by<lb/>
circulating a plain statement of its<lb/>
nature through the press, and by na-<lb/>
tionalizing the sanitary work in<lb/>
Cuba. The proper board can find a<lb/>
way of reaching the ear of the out-<lb/>
side world with the facts about the<lb/>
disease and at the same time give<lb/>
great assurance to those who may<lb/>
wish to visit or invest in Cuba.</p>
