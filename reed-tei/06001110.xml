Dr P. S. Hench<lb/>
<salute>Dear Sir</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am sorry you couldn't come here as<lb/>
it would have been easyer to explain<lb/>
verbally then to write, but Ill do my best.<lb/>
Picture A ground is right, it did slant from<lb/>
rail road cut towards river, turn building<lb/>
around <unclear>facing</unclear> building 113, remove windows<lb/>
and stoop, place door at left hand corner on<lb/>
flat wall, drop building to ground, raise<lb/>
back 6 or 8 inches from ground, we had no<lb/>
barrells down there, bridge appears to be a<lb/>
heavy one, she was not there, foot bridge was<lb/>
not between the houses but on side of 114 as<lb/>
marked on photo <unclear>b</unclear>.. an coming over bridge<lb/>
one could by streching <unclear>out</unclear> arm rub branches<lb/>
of tree. Unmarked building to left of III is the<lb/>
kitchen and messhall of men. About picture<lb/>
of all the men I don't know what to say except<lb/>
it was not taken while I was down there, we<lb/>
were in quarantine 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <unclear>Cov</unclear>. road gaurd<lb/>
around us, I don't think they would have<lb/>
allowed any photogafer in neither do I<lb/>
think that a group of Doctors making a profes-<lb/>
sional call would have brought a man<lb/>
with them to take their picture. I know it was<lb/>
not me in white uniform because I used<lb/>
pajamas after the first patients left in June<lb/>
of 1900 I had to burn everything and couldn't<lb/>
<unclear>(afford ?)</unclear><lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f06001111"/>
to burn my clothes, Up to the time that<lb/>
<unclear>West</unclear> got well and Maj. Reed decided that<lb/>
yellow fever was not contagious everything<lb/>
was destayed. Mr Perez must have used<lb/>
great imagination when he made Model<lb/>
for the picture. I don't know where or<lb/>
when but I've seen a surveying print<lb/>
of Colubia hospital and yellow fever huts<lb/>
in the lower right hand corner there were<lb/>
shown in smal letters the word &ldquo;Con-<lb/>
templated&rdquo; with an arrow pointing to-<lb/>
wards the outline of four buildings, but they<lb/>
were never built while I was there from<lb/>
6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of June 1900 to March 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1901. The drawing in<lb/>
Gen. Trubys book page 51 is correct except that<lb/>
he added the contemplated buildings 17-18-19-20<lb/>
after reading Gen. Trubys manuscript I drew<lb/>
his attention to the mistake, but he answered<lb/>
Dr Pinto said so, who was I to argue with the<lb/>
Gen? But I lived down there 10 1/2 months and I<lb/>
should know. I've corresponded with Mrs<lb/>
Jernegan since 1919 at one time she must<lb/>
have felt blue she wrote she would be willing<lb/>
to give five years of her life if she could sit for<lb/>
one hour again with her husband on the<lb/>
steps of the lith but, I then wrote and asked her<lb/>
if she could remember how many houses there<lb/>
were down there, I enclose her answers, the<lb/>
Jernegans were at quemados a year and a<lb/>
halve after me</p>

<salute>Very Respectfully</salute>

my legs get a litle stronger if called<lb/>
