FROM GEN. ALBERT E. TRUBY<lb/>
<hi>Ames</hi><lb/>
<hi>COPY</hi><lb/>
MILITARY RECORD OF <hi>ROGER POST AMES</hi><lb/>
Office of the <hi>Adjutant General of the<lb/>
Army</hi>.<lb/>
</opener>
<p>The records of my office show that Roger P. Ames served<lb/>
under contract as Acting Assistant Surgeon, from May 14, 1898,<lb/>
to November 30, 1898, when his contract was annulled under<lb/>
honorable conditions. He did not serve outside of the U.S.<lb/>
under this contract.</p>
<p>He again entered into contract as acting assistant surgeon<lb/>
April 15, <hi>1898</hi>. He reported for duty at Military Hospital No. 1,<lb/>
<hi>Havana, Cuba, April 25, 1898</hi>, and was on duty there until April 10,<lb/>
1900, when he was assigned to Columbia Barracks, Cuba. On<lb/>
November 20, 1900, he reported for duty at the experimental<lb/>
Sanitary Camp, near the Barracks, established by the Yellow Fever<lb/>
Board, under the direction of Major Walter Reed and was assigned<lb/>
to the Yellow Fever Ward. He appears to have remained on duty<lb/>
at this camp, which was known as Camp Lazear until Jan. 27,<lb/>
1901, when he contracted Yellow Fever for which treated until<lb/>
Feb. 5, 1901 when he returned to duty at Post hospital, Columbia<lb/>
Barracks, Cuba. His contract was annulled on his acceptance<lb/>
on April 26, 1901, of an appointment as Captain and Assistant<lb/>
Surgeon of Volunteers. He was relieved from duty at Columbia<lb/>
Barracks and ordered to report to the Commanding Officer,<lb/>
Pirotechnica Militar, Havana, Cuba, at which place he was in duty<lb/>
from June 15, 1901. He left Cuba Nov. 16, 1901, and arrived<lb/>
in San Francisco, Cala. Nov. 18, 1901, remaining on duty at<lb/>
Presidio Hospital, San Francisco, Cala. until Nov. 27, 1901<lb/>
when granted two months leave of absence. He was appointed<lb/>
Major and Surgeon of Volunteers Jan. 6, 1902, and was ordered<lb/>
to Manila P.J., at which place he was present on Feb. 19, 1902.<lb/>
He reported back to the U.S. March 9, 1902, and remained in the<lb/>
U. S. on duty at various points until Feb. 1, 1903, when he was<lb/>
honorably discharged from service.</p>
<p>Should<lb/>
be 1899</p>
<p>He again entered the contract as Acting Assistant Surgeon<lb/>
Feb. 27, 1903, and his contract was annulled under honorable<lb/>
conditions March 15, 1907. Under this last contract he did not<lb/>
serve outside of the United States.</p>
