</dateline><lb/>
DR. PHILIP S. HENCH<lb/>
DR. CHARLES H. SLOCUMB<lb/>
<salute>My dear General Kean:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I do appreciate your kindness in perusing the long letters I've sent you and<lb/>
answering them so rapidly. As I wrote Kellogg, whatever you decide as to naming the<lb/>
anonymous figure should be final. You now say that Dr. Henry R. Carter was &ldquo;not in<lb/>
Cuba during the period of the Board's experiments (I know this from his daughter).&rdquo;<lb/>
But I seemed to recall that previously you told me otherwise so last night I reviewed<lb/>
all our correspondence and found in your letter of Jan. 23, 1941 (page 5) your state-<lb/>
ment that Carter was in charge of the quarantine service in Havana but went back to<lb/>
the U. S. prior to July 23, 1900. But written on one of 2 or 3 smaller sheets which<lb/>
you fastened onto your Jan. 23 letter you have written, &ldquo;I find that Dr. Henry R.<lb/>
Carter Public Health and Marine Hospital Service was in Havana from July 1 to Sept.<lb/>
1, <hi>1900</hi>.&rdquo;<add>should be 1899.</add> I wonder which of these is correct. As far as the painting is concerned<lb/>
I agree Carter has little place, but at your convenience I'd like to know about Carter<lb/>
for my own information.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Your diary for Mar. 10, 1900 mentions the arrival of Carter. Was this Henry R.?<lb/>
You mention him also on June 14. In your entry of Sept. 1 you mentioned Dr. Glennan<lb/>
who succeeded Carter. In the excerpts from your diary that I have I don't find his<lb/>
name later.</p>
<p>But the above item is not the main reason for this letter. I am <hi>holding up</hi><lb/>
the enclosed letter to Miss Wood until you have a chance to approve my sending it.<lb/>
As you will see I have <hi>not</hi> sent her any of the contentious matter in Reed's letters<lb/>
to you or to Sternberg. I've only sent her the excerpts as given herein. But unless<lb/>
you say otherwise, I propose to let her have copies of the collection of letters which<lb/>
Miss Blossom Reed let me have. Miss Wood has been trying to weeks to see Miss Reed<lb/>
to borrow the complete manuscript but has been unable to get to see her or her mother.<lb/>
But Miss Wood's deadline is Nov. 1 and I am disposed to assume that Miss Reed would<lb/>
be as willing for Miss Wood to see the letters as for me to see them. And I assume<lb/>
that Miss Wood will not quote them in extenso or use them in such a way as to lessen<lb/>
their publication value for Miss Reed.</p>
<p>Of course, I am only sending her the letters of 1900-1901. The previous<lb/>
ones from 1874 to 1900 she must get from Miss Reed and I hope she can, for they are<lb/>
very revealing of his fine character.</p>
<p>Since starting this letter I've received already your answer to mine of yes-<lb/>
terday. I think no mistake could be made with either Pinto or Ames and I leave it to<lb/>
Kellogg to decide. It's his responsibility, not ours.</p>
<p>Please give Mrs. Kean my kindest regards.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Always gratefully yours,</salute>

P. S. Hench, M. D.<lb/>
<seg>
P. S. I've written <add>Gen.</add> Truby another letter trying to &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; a bit. I did<lb/>
not indicate that I had heard anything from you re my belated correspondence.<lb/>
