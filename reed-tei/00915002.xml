Chiclayo, <date value="1921-09-03">September 3, 1921.</date>
</dateline>
Dr. Wicliffe Rose,<lb/>
General Director, International Health Board,<lb/>
61 Broadway, New York City.<lb/>
<salute>Dear Doctor Rose:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Yesterday I returned from my trip to Panama. I left <unclear>here</unclear> on<lb/>
the fourth of August by way of Lima. On arriving in Lima (<unclear>together</unclear> with Dr.<lb/>
J.H. White) I found that <unclear>they</unclear> were still having their farewell parties for the<lb/>
various <unclear>embassies</unclear> and special representatives for the Centennial and that I<lb/>
could do very little business and decided to take advantage of this time to<lb/>
go to Panama to attend to certain important personal matters as well as to con-<lb/>
fer with Col. Fisher <unclear>an</unclear> DR. Rucker about the quarantine. Dr. Rucker issued an<lb/>
order suspending quarantine against Peru, or rather modified it to a six day<lb/>
observation of passengers from the Peruvian ports, after the time of their<lb/>
<unclear>embarcation</unclear>, but not requiring the usual former quarantine <unclear>proceedure</unclear> against<lb/>
the ship or the permanence in quarantine of the passengers.</p>
<p>While in Panama this office forwarded to me certain mail which had<lb/>
arrived immediately after I left for Lima. In this mail I received Miss. Read's<lb/>
letter of July 14, copy of <unclear>your</unclear> letter to Dr. White under date of July 16, and<lb/>
your letter to me dated July 20.</p>
<p>Upon my return to Chiclayo I find in my office the following letters:<lb/>
Copy of Mr. <unclear>Bausch's</unclear> letter of May 7, your letters of May 20, and 21, Copy of<lb/>
your letter introducing Dr. Frederick L. Hoffman, your letter of May 27, Dr.<lb/>
<unclear>Welle's</unclear> letter of May 23, Miss Read's letters of June 21 (two of them) of June<lb/>
29 and July 12, as well as yours of July 29th. This will give you some idea of<lb/>
the irregularity of our mails. To further illustrate this point, I wrote Mrs.<lb/>
<unclear>Hanson</unclear> under date of June 22nd enclosing certain important papers, registering<lb/>
the letter. This letter was received by her after my arrival in Panama August<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f00915003"/>
2. W.R., I.H.B., September 3, 1921.<lb/>
15, nearly two months after it had been mailed. I presume that by this time you<lb/>
have also received some delayed reports and letters. I think I have replied to all<lb/>
yours except those indicated above.</p>
<p>While in Panama I mailed you a large tube containing a graphic chart of<lb/>
the work in the Province of Trujillo, together with a map of the Department of Lam-<lb/>
bayeque. Unfortunately we did not have all the data complete to carry out the mos-<lb/>
quito curves in the graphic chart, but it is all now down to the base line as<lb/>
shown on the chart for Trujillo itself. The map of the Department of Lambayeque<lb/>
will show you better than I can tell you in a letter what the problem was here.<lb/>
You will <unclear>not<add>e</add></unclear> the many small towns, villages and estates which we were unable to<lb/>
visit personally, and were obliged to leave them for the fever to clean them out.<lb/>
During the month of August Mr. Pickett and Mr. Seeley have stocked everything with<lb/>
fish, even the small places on the line from <unclear>Lambeyeque</unclear> to <unclear>Motupe</unclear>. Up to date in<lb/>
this Department we have <add>used</add> more than one hundred-forty thousand fish (up to the end of<lb/>
the month of August) and are still distributing. The results have been beyond my<lb/>
first expectations. The local Physicians say that at present they are having about<lb/>
20% less sick calls than they have formerly had for the same corresponding period.<lb/>
I am not ready to say why. It is probable that the numerous wells which we have<lb/>
stocked with fish were formerly breeding anopheles. Both the anopheles and culex<lb/>
index, in addition to that of the stegomya, has been reduced. I feel quite certain<lb/>
about <unclear>the</unclear> security of this Department at the present time.</p>
<p>In Libertad we have distributed more than one hundred thousand fish, and in<lb/>
Ancash about 30 000, so up to date I think we have about 270 000 fish distributed,<lb/>
for stegomya control. It is the most effective method of attack but it makes less<lb/>
expert Inspectors. In our case however we had carried on the other method so long<lb/>
that we have a very expert group of Inspectors and Visitadores, which is a very<lb/>
great advantage when added to this new system of working.</p>
<p>On my return from Panama I went ashore in Buena Ventura, Columbia, to see<lb/>
what the place was like, and to find out what I could in regard to the rumors of the<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f00915004"/>
3. W.R., I.H.B., September 3, 1921.<lb/>
case of yellow fever there last year. The case referred to seems to have been the<lb/>
death of the British Consul, who turned yellow before dying. The history in his<lb/>
case however is that he had been a sufferer from heart and liver trouble, and had<lb/>
previously had attacks of illness with icterus. This information was given to me<lb/>
by a Mrs. Smith, the wife of an American Surgeon who has a hospital at La Cumbre.<lb/>
The natives with whom I talked gave no history of any illness of that kind for<lb/>
several years, and I am inclined to believe that the rumors of last years case or<lb/>
cases are unfounded. I speak of this because I discussed this matter with Dr. White<lb/>
and suggested to him that this place be investigated.</p>
<p>Buena Ventura is a very small place, quite distant from other towns, one<lb/>
which has every evidence of being <unclear>infested</unclear> with malaria. It is very swampy, having<lb/>
numerous low <unclear>wet</unclear> areas which could well be prolific breeders of anopheles, and it<lb/>
could happen that a case of pernicious malaria would be mistaken for yellow fever<lb/>
by persons who are inexpert in the diagnosis of either. While there I made one of<lb/>
my customary <unclear>investigations;viz.</unclear> that of inspection of the holy water in the church.<lb/>
There was no breeding in it<unclear>,</unclear> In this section wherever the stegomya breeding has<lb/>
been high we have always found <del><unclear>stegomya</unclear></del><add>larvae</add> in the holy water.</p>
<p>On the way south we stopped at the Port of Pizarro in the Province of<lb/>
Tumbes. I went ashore and went up to Tumbes (which is the most northerly province<lb/>
of Peru, bounded on the north by Ecuador). We have had some men doing anti-stegomya<lb/>
work there, and apparently with fairly good results. I found no breeding in my brief<lb/>
inspection. However I left orders for the man there to stock all doubtful places<lb/>
with fish. Tumbes <add>(the term and capital of the Province)</add> is within one-half hours ride of the Ecuadorean frontier. I do<lb/>
<unclear>not</unclear> think that it will be necessary to keep up the work there. Dr. Carter and I are<lb/>
of the opinion that this place was immunized by the epidemic of 1918 &amp; '19.</p>
<p>In Paita I made further inquiries, but <del>there</del><add>it</add> seems that there has been<lb/>
nothing of a suspicious nature since our last year's campaign. This in further<lb/>
conformation of former reports.</p>
<p>While in Panama, I found that Mr. Dunn the Entomoligist to the Panama<lb/>
Canal was to be let out on a count of the reduction of force, and that he was<lb/>
about to be taken over by the United States Public Health Service for work in<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f00915005"/>
4. W.R., I.H.B., September 3, 1921.<lb/>
the States. In as much as I only expected to keep Mr. Corrigan and Pickett until I<lb/>
should be back to go over the situation with them, I thought it would be well to<lb/>
take advantage of Mr. Dunn and bring him down for a double purpose; that of using<lb/>
him both as Inspector and of carrying out properly the observations which we have<lb/>
started on the stegomya. Dr. White knows of this, at least some of it. I wanted to<lb/>
prove why it is that stegomya only breed in artificial containers, and I thought<lb/>
that we were on the track of the reason why. It seemed to me it might be considered<lb/>
worth while to be able to include this in writing the final chapter of the history<lb/>
of yellow fever on the Pacific Coast of South America. The expense will be very<lb/>
small relatively, as my plan is to devote only a part of his time to this problem.<lb/>
Mr. Dunn has done field work with me in Panama and did some very good work during<lb/>
the war in his Army Service. Lately he had a very important problem going in the<lb/>
Board of Health Laboratory of the Canal Zone, on the tick in its relation to re-<lb/>
lapsing fever, as well as a very good series of observation on the stegomya which<lb/>
was more or less along the same lines as I have been working here in Peru.</p>
<p>If you do not approve of this line kindly cable me on receipt of this and<lb/>
I will limit his work to that of supervising inspector. I offered him $400.00 per<lb/>
month but he held out for $425.00, and expenses, on the grounds that this was a<lb/>
brief temporary assignment, and would <unclear>break</unclear> his connections with work in the states.</p>
<p>Mr. Corrigan and Sr. Sainz are continuing their work in the Department of<lb/>
Ancash together with Dr. Caballero. A few days ago we sent them ten thousand fish<lb/>
from here, because of the difficulty in getting fish in that section. As soon as I<lb/>
have things lined up in this office I shall start south on a tour of inspection<lb/>
going as far as Lima, expecting to reach Lima about the middle of October. If it<lb/>
can be done I will try to get them to do stegomya work in Lima for the balance of<lb/>
the year. As I have often stated before it now depends on what has happened to the<lb/>
south- of the north we are certain. The only place of which I still have any doubts<lb/>
is of Lima and Callao, but especially of Lima. All towns to the north of that we<lb/>
will have controlled before the end of the year. We are taking no chances on any-<lb/>
thing north of Lima and Callao. The protions of Lima which are the occasion of<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f00915006"/>
5. W.R., I.H.B., September 3, 1921.<lb/>
uncertainty are the poorer subdivisions where there is an insufficient water<lb/>
supply, such as the Victoria section, Chirimoya, and &ldquo;Abajo la Puente&rdquo; a poor<lb/>
section on the north side of the river. In Callao Mr. Richardson and one of the<lb/>
Inspectors which I had last year <add>Sr. Mauro Torres U.,</add> have been doing some anti stegomya work,<lb/>
directly under Mr. Wrightson, but I believe this has been suspended. If I can<lb/>
get this also placed under my control I shall have them start a vigorous fish<lb/>
campaign, and may be able to spare some of the Inspectors from the northern terri-<lb/>
tory for this work.</p>
<p>The only <unclear>loophole</unclear> that I can <unclear>see</unclear> for trouble during the coming warm<lb/>
weather would be some smouldering focus about Lima and Callao,- the northern<lb/>
Departments will be safe due to the work which we are doing and will continue<lb/>
to <unclear>sun</unclear> do. The north is well organized, with experienced employees, which will<lb/>
enable me to keep a closer watch on Lima and Callao than has been possible up to<lb/>
date.</p>
<p>The winter in Lima has been so cold that I am inclined to believe that<lb/>
even if some case had gotten through the infection most probably <unclear>has</unclear> died out, and<lb/>
the outbreak would have to be from some place in the north, which at the present<lb/>
time we do not think possible.</p>
<p>I will take up the different points in the letters referred to above, in<lb/>
a separate communication.</p>
<p>I want to express my appreciation and gratitude for the generous support<lb/>
which the International Health Board has given in this campaign, and especially<lb/>
to you personally for the <unclear>broad an generous</unclear> view you have taken of our efforts.<lb/>
Had it not been for your help we would have lost the campaign altogether. I shall<lb/>
endeavor to make the Government understand this.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Very truly yours,</salute>

Director of Campaign</signed>.
