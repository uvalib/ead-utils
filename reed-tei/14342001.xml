<salute>Dear Mumsie-</salute>
</opener>
<p>I was so glad<lb/>
to hear the news about<lb/>
Tom. How I wish I had<lb/>
been there when he walk-<lb/>
ed in! Tell him to please<lb/>
go to New Orleans via Havana.<lb/>
If those State health officers<lb/>
would only be truly scientif-<lb/>
ic and stop the fool busi-<lb/>
ness of fumigating clothes<lb/>
for yellow fever prevention<lb/>
Tom really could make us<lb/>
a little visit. But the<lb/>
New Orleans quarantine is<lb/>
already down, and as rigid<lb/>
as ever.<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f14342002"/>
Did you ever know any-<lb/>
thing so heart rending<lb/>
as that performance of<lb/>
the Rawlins. I hardly dare<lb/>
to hope my boxes may turn<lb/>
up on the Sedgewick, and<lb/>
I do not dare to contem-<lb/>
plate what will happen<lb/>
if they don't. I <hi>needed</hi><lb/>
stockings two months ago!<lb/>
Besides the box from Helen<lb/>
Miss Bacon had sent me<lb/>
one too, containing cake<lb/>
and all sorts of nice things.<lb/>
The Sedgewick is going<lb/>
back by way of Porto<lb/>
Rico. Mama is delighted<lb/>
at the prospect of seeing<lb/>
San Juan, and so is Gertrude.</p>
<pb n="3" id="f14342003"/>
<p>Four days ago Rannie and I would have<lb/>
hooted at the idea that we were not<lb/>
settled here for the summer, infact Rannie<lb/>
thought he could stay here as long as<lb/>
he pleased, but - Tuesday Major Greble<lb/>
came out to luncheon and told Rannie<lb/>
Gen. Wood wished him to take Major <unclear>G.'s</unclear><lb/>
place in charge of charities and hospitals.<lb/>
It was only a year ago Rannie turned<lb/>
all of his share of that business over to the<lb/>
Major <unclear>chortling</unclear> with joy at having gotten<lb/>
rid of it; and now here is Major Greble<lb/>
going to West Point and Rannie back<lb/>
into the charities, ten times worse than<lb/>
he was before! Rannie did not want<lb/>
to take <add>it</add> for tho! he knew it was a<lb/>
compliment he likewise knew we could<lb/>
not afford to live in town, and the<lb/>
very thought of the <unclear>Maestranza</unclear> made<lb/>
me sick. So we talked it over with our<lb/>
&ldquo;Lady from Phila&rdquo;. Capt. <unclear>Slocum</unclear> and ar-<lb/>
rived at no satisfactory conclusion so<lb/>
Monday Rannie went in to see Major<lb/>
Greble, who marched him straight to<lb/>
Gen. Wood. The Gen. was perfectly lovely,<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f14342004"/>
said he was the man<lb/>
he wanted and asked<lb/>
what were his objections.<lb/>
When Rannie said he<lb/>
could not live in town<lb/>
on his pay he replied<lb/>
&ldquo;why not live at Colum-<lb/>
bia?&rdquo; Rannie explained<lb/>
how there were no quar-<lb/>
ters, so the Gen. said<lb/>
&ldquo;I'll build you a set&rdquo;! Then<lb/>
Rannie feebly remonstrated<lb/>
that he knew nothing<lb/>
of financial administration<lb/>
but the Gen. said &ldquo;you<lb/>
know as much as I did<lb/>
when I came to Cuba, all<lb/>
the experience I had<lb/>
ever had was in trying<lb/>
to make <hi rend="superscript">$</hi>133.33 last <del><unclear></unclear></del><lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f14342005"/>
through the month!&rdquo;<lb/>
So then Rannie had<lb/>
nothing more to say,<lb/>
tho' I know his heart<lb/>
yearns over his beloved<lb/>
hospital and he simply<lb/>
hates to give it up. I<lb/>
am perfectly happy as<lb/>
long as we are to live<lb/>
out here, for I could not<lb/>
possibly have spent the<lb/>
summer in town with<lb/>
the children. Rannie<lb/>
will have to go off in<lb/>
a little while around<lb/>
the island with Major<lb/>
Greble, and then as Gen.<lb/>
Wood said to him &ldquo;Oh<lb/>
you'll like it you will<lb/>
be away from home at<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f14342006"/>
least one week in every month.&rdquo; I know<lb/>
what to look forward to! But it is<lb/>
a very important position, and it is a<lb/>
good thing to be on the staff of a<lb/>
rising young general.</p>
<p>I saw <unclear>Will Renie</unclear> today at the Palace.<lb/>
He did not know me at first. He looks<lb/>
the same as ever, but I only had a<lb/>
<unclear>minute's</unclear> conversation with him.</p>
<p>I suppose now Tommy is home you have<lb/>
recovered from all your ailments, so I hope<lb/>
you will feel able to write me soon.</p>
<p>Letters from the family have been rather<lb/>
few and far between lately. Give my<lb/>
love to them all. I wonder if Tom got<lb/>
my picture I sent him a little while<lb/>
ago. Bobs and Martha are very well.<lb/>
I wonder if Doll can't hunt up some books<lb/>
for me to read Martha. If some of you<lb/>
would go to <unclear>Brentance's</unclear> and select some<lb/>
things and have them send the bill<lb/>
I would be very grateful.</p>
