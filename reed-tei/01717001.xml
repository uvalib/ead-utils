<salute>My sweet E.;</salute>
</opener>
<p>After the<lb/>
day's work was done, yes-<lb/>
terday, I thought that I could<lb/>
spend the concluding hours<lb/>
of the day in no better or<lb/>
more pleasant way than<lb/>
by writing to the dear lit-<lb/>
tle girl who had been so<lb/>
good as to write me such<lb/>
a long letter- A<add>l</add>beit, it was<lb/>
Wednesday, &amp; notwithstanding<lb/>
the fact that I knew you<lb/>
would not care a penny<lb/>
for <hi>any</hi> letter that was<lb/>
not written on either <hi>Mon-<lb/>
day</hi> or <hi>Thursday</hi>, still I thought,<lb/>
<pb n="2" id="f01717002"/>

to write to my little love, would<lb/>
be a fitting termination to<lb/>
the day- And indeed, I believe<lb/>
that I should have written<lb/>
had not the reason, which<lb/>
I have just stated, been<lb/>
present in my mind, and,<lb/>
of course, I couldn't think<lb/>
of violating my little Em-<lb/>
ilie's wishes- Ah! You can't<lb/>
imagine what a splendid<lb/>
piece <add>of composition</add> you missed! One of<lb/>
the <hi>old</hi> kind- like those<lb/>
long, sixteen-page letters<lb/>
that I <hi>used</hi> to write<lb/>
when you were a <hi>little</hi><lb/>
girl, just graduated from<lb/>
College! I can but draw<lb/>
a sigh, of the very deepest,<lb/>
when I think of the num-<lb/>
<pb n="3" id="f01717003"/>
ber of bright things I was<lb/>
going to say &amp; the number<lb/>
of sweet expressions <add>I</add><lb/>
had at my pen's end; ready<lb/>
to submit them, one &amp; all,<lb/>
for your consideration: but<lb/>
they are gone now- Yes,<lb/>
fled forever &amp; may never<lb/>
return, &amp; whereas, had they<lb/>
been written down, e're<lb/>
they took their <hi>immortal</hi><lb/>
(excuse me, for using the ex-<lb/>
pression, but no other will<lb/>
do justice) flight, I might<lb/>
have expired happy, know-<lb/>
ing how great a monument<lb/>
I had erected, <hi>now</hi> I must<lb/>
perish ignobly! Do you<lb/>
blame me for being sad?<lb/>
But I <hi>will</hi> suppress my<lb/>
<pb n="4" id="f01717004"/>
sorrow &amp; disappointment-<lb/>
and not even <hi>you</hi> shall<lb/>
know the depths of my grief!<lb/>
All that I can ask of you<lb/>
is that you will accept what<lb/>
I have written with the<lb/>
customary margin that is<lb/>
due all <add>of</add> my expressions, and<lb/>
I <hi>think</hi> I can still find<lb/>
some happiness &ldquo;here<lb/>
below&rdquo;! whether I find hap-<lb/>
piness or not, I have certain-<lb/>
ly struck a mine of <hi>work</hi>-<lb/>
&ldquo;Busy&rdquo;! why that is the fee-<lb/>
blest word that can possi-<lb/>
bly be applied to my pres-<lb/>
ent condition- If I was<lb/>
ever idle, I do not regret it<lb/>
now, for I have enough<lb/>
to do to atone for all my<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f01717005"/>
past laziness. The only con-<lb/>
solation I have, is that it<lb/>
must soon be over &amp; then<lb/>
I will have a long re-<lb/>
spite. I must confess<lb/>
that your allusion to some<lb/>
compliment, that <del>I</del> had been<lb/>
paid me by one of the fair<lb/>
sex, raised my curios<add>i</add>ty<lb/>
to no ordinary pitch of ex-<lb/>
citement- That the effect<lb/>
would have been otherwise,<lb/>
could not have been expec-<lb/>
ted- Remember my well-<lb/>
known conceit &amp; that a<lb/>
compliment from a lady<lb/>
is a rare occurrence in<lb/>
my life- Can't recall but<lb/>
<hi>two</hi>- One you would not<lb/>
disclose, which I thought<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f01717006"/>
and still think, was very<lb/>
cruel, on your part, &amp; the<lb/>
other contained in your last<lb/>
letter- In vain have I racked<lb/>
my brain to find out <hi>who</hi><lb/>
the lady is that has been so<lb/>
very kind as to furnish me<lb/>
a good topic to write about-<lb/>
It was so considerate in<lb/>
her to do so- I almost am<lb/>
led to think that the lady<lb/>
is named miss <hi>Emilie</hi>, &amp;<lb/>
would be convinced of the<lb/>
fact, did I not know her mod-<lb/>
esty is too great for such<lb/>
a compliment- Since it is<lb/>
not you, my darling, I am<lb/>
willing to bet my <hi>high hat</hi><lb/>
that the fair one is a <hi>mrs.</hi>, &amp;<lb/>
<hi>not</hi> a <hi>miss</hi>! Come! will you<lb/>
take the offer? Ah! my<lb/>
<pb n="7" id="f01717007"/>
precious little girl, do you think that<lb/>
I am <hi>so</hi> innocent? Alas! always select<lb/>
me to solve a problem! you will never<lb/>
regret it. As for Miss Peace, who complains<lb/>
of my neglect, I've nought to say; although<lb/>
I would that I could avail myself of your<lb/>
offer to come again &amp; remain a week-<lb/>
I wouldn't promise, however, that I would<lb/>
call on Miss Peace, for when I visit Mur-<lb/>
freesboro, it is for the <hi>sole</hi> purpose of seeing<lb/>
my darling, sweet Emilie, &amp; no other man, woman<lb/>
or child in this wide, wide world! So much for Miss P.<lb/>
Finger is quite well-</p>
<closer>
<salute>Believe me, as ever, my darling, your<lb/>
fond &amp; devoted,</salute>
